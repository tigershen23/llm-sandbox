Welcome just released two awesome new features that help extend the connection with your audience beyond the webinar — CTA Overlays and CTA Pinned Cards. These new additions compel attendees to take action with your content or get in touch with you at the click of a button. Read on to learn how these features enhance engagement with prospective customers and help steer them closer toward conversion.\nCTA Overlays\nWhen we say Welcome provides an\nunmatched attendee experience\n, we mean it. CTA Overlays offer an entirely new way to create and display call-to-action buttons that encourage engagement, get noticed,\nand\nlook sleek.\nYou can use two different types of CTA Overlays in your presentation.\nCreate eye-catching CTA buttons or scannable QR codes to encourage attendees to take action. Showcase your valuable resources—from case studies to product brochures and make it simple for attendees to demo or sign up for upcoming events. Whether your attendees are in the awareness, consideration, or decision stage of the buyer's journey, use this new feature to create the appropriate call to action. Check out some examples below:\nCustomizing Your CTA\nForget about basic CTA buttons, this new feature allows you to tailor each CTA for maximum impact. Customize your CTAs from placement and color to whether the desired destination is a link or just an intent signal to follow up with the attendee after the show.\nCTA Pinned Cards\nOnce your CTA Overlay pushes to the stage, Welcome will automatically display your CTA in the Public Chat in a card format.

An economic downturn can be the perfect opportunity to show off your brand's resilience, stand out from the pack and grab more market share. And what better way to do that than with a solid brand marketing strategy? Think of it as an investment in your brand's future, helping you weather the storm and position yourself for success when the economy improves. So, grab your umbrella, and let's start building that marketing plan - the looming recession may be all doom & gloom, but your relevance doesn't have to be.\nWhy Brand Marketing Is More Important Than Ever\nIt's natural to feel worried during uncertain economic times. The urge to reduce expenses is strong, and marketing budgets often become a target for cuts. However, taking a step back and considering the bigger picture is essential.\nRemember that recessions are temporary, and the current economic uncertainty may not even result in a full-blown recession. Many\nleading economists predict\na mild and brief recession, or in some cases, no recession at all.\nPanic can cloud your judgment and lead to hasty business decisions. Instead of completely cutting your marketing budget, it's important to remain calm and make informed decisions. History has shown that brands that continued their marketing efforts during a recession were able to bounce back faster. Research also suggests that slowing down your marketing efforts is not the best approach.\nSo, take a deep breath and strive to make rational choices. By staying level-headed and keeping your brand visible, you can set yourself up to\nincrease brand awareness and attract new customers\neven in challenging times.\n1. Invest in Market Research\nOne of the secrets to staying ahead in an economic downturn is conducting new market research to market during a recession effectively. It may sound crazy to spend time and money researching when budgets are tight, but consumer behavior has shifted. Especially after the last three years we've had, but if you're relying on the research you did even several months ago, your understanding of the marketplace and your customers are out-of-date.\nYou want to use your marketing budget wisely, so now is the time to get very specific about your target audience, buyer personas, and demographics so you can tailor messaging and know which marketing tactics will reach your ideal customers.\n2. Don't Cut Your Online Paid Advertising\nIf you don't show up, someone else will. These words could not be more true when it comes to your search engine marketing strategy. Many competitors will get nervous and cut back their paid marketing efforts, but if you remain in the game, you could reap the benefits and grow your online presence.\nSo before you slash your ad spend, think about the following:\nIncreased competition: In tough economic times, competition intensifies, and cutting back on SEM can result in losing market share to your competitors who are still investing in their online presence. Don't believe us? Research shows that after just six months without advertising, average\nconsumer brand awareness decreases by 24%\n.\nLower cost per click: During a recession, the cost per click on search engines tends to decrease, so maintaining or increasing your SEM spend can result in getting more value for your budget.\nIncreased online activity: In times of economic uncertainty, people tend to spend more time online researching products and services, making it an ideal time to reach potential customers.\nLong-term impact: SEM provides long-term benefits, such as building brand recognition and establishing a strong online presence, which can be critical for survival during a recession and puts you in a better position fro when the market rights iteself.\nA popular adage goes like this: When times are good, you\nshould\nadvertise. When times are bad, you\nmust\nadvertise. So instead of cutting back on SEM spend, consider reevaluating your strategy and find ways to maximize your return on investment.\n3. Try B2B Influencer Marketing\nPeople are more prone to act upon the suggestions of their peers, and the B2B world is no exception. This cost-effective approach is growing in popularity and proving successful in reaching a wider audience, spreading brand messages, and boosting awareness, especially in tough times.\nIt's not just about mega-influencers either - sometimes, the smaller influencers pack a bigger punch! Micro-influencers, who can come in the form of employees, customers, or industry experts, are all about engagement over size. It's not just the quantity of followers that counts; it's the quality of their interaction with your brand.\nSo, what can you achieve with your B2B influencer marketing campaign?\nIf you're not sure, here are a few popular goals:\nBoost brand awareness\nEngage new target audiences\nDrive sales\nMaintain a positive brand reputation\nTo measure these goals, it's important to track the following metrics:\nClicks\nImpressions\nConversions\nSales\n4. Build Trust & Awareness with Content Marketing\nStep up your content game and be a trusted source of valuable information during tough times. When budgets get tighter, research takes center stage, and consumers want to make informed decisions before purchasing. So polishing up your current content and thinking about the added value you can bring to your market could pay off.\nTackle the tough questions head-on and showcase your expertise by diving into topics that speak directly to the problems your product or service solves. Give answers to common queries and highlight the unique value you bring to the table. Address your target audience's fears and top concerns, especially in the early stages of your new customer journey.\nYou can mix various tactics to create an effective content marketing strategy:\nBlogging: Regularly publishing blog posts on topics related to your business and industry can help establish your brand as a thought leader and drive organic traffic to your website.\nSocial Media: Sharing your content on social media platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, and Facebook can help reach a wider audience and drive engagement. Short-form videos are taking over social media as it has\nthe highest ROI\nof any social media marketing strategy.\nInfographics: Visual content like infographics can help simplify complex information and make it easier for audiences to understand and remember. Infographics are also easily shareable.\nVideo Marketing: Creating and sharing videos on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Tiktok can help increase engagement and drive traffic to your website.\nE-books and Whitepapers: Long-form content like e-books and whitepapers can provide in-depth information on a particular topic and can be used to generate inbound leads.\nCase Studies: Sharing real-life examples of how your product or service has helped solve a particular problem can help build credibility and establish trust with your audience.\nWebinars: Hosting live webinars or on-demand webinars can help educate your target audience, provide value, and\ngenerate inbound leads\n.\nNewsletters: Regularly sending newsletters to your subscribers can help keep your audience updated on the latest industry news, trends, and updates from your company.\nInterested in keeping up with the latest B2B marketing news and best practices?

Something went wrong.\nMix and match these tactics to craft a winning content marketing strategy that'll score you big with your target audience and help you build trust organically without blowing the marketing budget.\nJust keep in mind to not only write for Google's search engine and algorithm. Write all your content with SEO best practices in mind, but also make sure your content is helpful, reliable, and people-first in nature, or Google might ding you.\nBuild Brand Loyalty\nBrand marketing is for more than just attracting new customers. Companies should look inward to their existing customer base and focus on building brand loyalty too. Loyal customers are essential, especially when the markets are bearish.\nDid you know that a\n5% increase in customer retention can increase company revenue by 25% to a whopping 95%\n? That's why customer marketing and building brand loyalty are so important when you're tasked with doing more with less.\nCustomer marketing is a customer-focused approach that emphasizes empathy, builds trust, rewards loyalty, supports customer service, and responds to customer feedback. When customers feel valued, have avenues for feedback, and receive rewards, they become more loyal to your brand.\nShift some of your marketing budget towards customer marketing to reap the following benefits:\nReduce risk\n. You already have a relationship and knowledge of your existing customers and their needs, making it easier to market to them. Customers who have already bought from you are more likely to repeat their business or upgrade, reducing the risk of trying new tactics to attract new customers.\nConserve marketing budget.\nIf you reduce spending on lead acquisition during a tough economy, you have more resources to support existing customers, increase brand loyalty, and raise brand awareness - tactics that drive long-term growth.\nBoost retention.\nCustomer marketing tactics can also boost retention. If B2B customers are cutting back on major purchases, a higher customer retention rate could make a significant impact on your revenue. In tough times, you don't want to lose ground.\nRead The 5 Customer Marketing Tactics You Can Use to Build Brand Loyalty\nhere\n.\nIt's a common misconception that marketing is a luxury when in reality, it's the steady engine that keeps success humming along. But your marketing strategy needs to shift gears in tough times like a recession. Take inventory of all your marketing channels, analyze channel performance, and invest in those channels performing the best.\nDon't make the mistake of slashing your marketing budget - it'll only hurt your chances of weathering the economic storm. But instead, reallocate your spend, and if you're feeling the pressure and your wallet's getting thin, focus on connecting with your customers and potential customers where they are. Match your marketing message and marketing efforts to their current buying habits and make an impact, even on a tight budget.\nB2B Institute Research Fellow, Strategist, and Marketing Consultant Peter Field said, \"Because the sales funnel in B2B purchasing is generally longer than in B2C, the arguments in favor of supporting long-term growth through brand building are likely to be even stronger in B2B than in B2C. B2B Brand associations created now are likely to bring the greatest sales benefit during the recovery period, precisely when the rewards are biggest. Brand advertising is not about profiting in recession, it is about capitalizing on recovery.\"\nSo to wrap it all up, keep calm and carry on. The strong and resilient brands will pull through and make it to the other side.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/stand-out-by-staying-in-5-ways-to-use-brand-marketing-right-now\nKeep reading\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n5 B2B Marketing Growths Hacks To Try\nRead"}

You've probably tried a million different tactics, from email marketing to content marketing to social media advertising. But there's one form of content marketing you may not take full advantage of: webinars.\nWebinars are interactive virtual events that could be presentations, panels, seminars, or workshops that allow you to educate your target audience on a particular topic. They're an incredibly effective way to attract, warm, and convert leads. Here's why:\nWebinars Build Relationships with Your Target Audience\nWhen you host a webinar, you're not just\ngiving\na presentation—you're\nbuilding\na relationship with your target audience. You're showing them that you're an expert in your field and passionate about educating others. This builds trust and credibility, which are essential when it comes time to make a sale. After all, who doesn't love getting their questions answered in real time by someone who really knows their stuff?\nPlanning a webinar? Check out the\nWebinar Best Practices Guide\nto ensure your webinar program is a success!\nWebinars Allow You to Qualify Your Leads\nA webinar is a perfect opportunity to qualify your leads. When qualifying them, it's important to consider both the webinar's content and the registrants' behavior.\nConsider what type of content you'll be presenting. Is it educational, thought leadership, product demo, or product training? Whichever category it is, the content type provides insights into the prospects' buying stage.\nContent like best practices and thought leadership are best used for awareness and don't generally generate sales-ready leads. However, signups for a product or new feature demo could indicate readiness for a sales follow-up.\nThe next way to further qualify the lead is to take note of the registrant's behavior during the webinar. Webinars are an excellent opportunity to ask more questions and gather more info about registrants. Conducting\npolls\nis an easy way to do this. And if you're rolling up behavior into a lead score, assign specific poll answers points that will help indicate lead quality.\nInclude clickable CTA overlays to prompt attendees to act.\n‍\nAnother idea is to include a CTA overlay in your presentation to prompt the attendee to take the next specified action. For instance, in an awareness-type webinar, have a CTA button to download a guide or sign up for your newsletter or next event. In more bottom-of-the-funnel webinars, include a CTA button for a demo. Whatever the CTA, the attendee's action or lack of action can help indicate their readiness and interest. This allows you to separate the tire kickers from the serious buyers, so you can focus your sales efforts on those who are more likely to convert.\nWebinars Expand Your Reach\nFinally, webinars are an incredibly effective way to generate leads because they allow you to reach many people with minimal effort. A single well-executed webinar can generate hundreds or even thousands of high-quality leads you can nurture through your sales funnel. Think about it this way: a webinar is a live presentation that your audience can attend from the comfort of their homes (offices or wherever they happen to be). No need for costly travel expenses or time spent out of the office—a win for you and your potential customers.\nLastly, webinars are insanely shareable. If someone misses the live event, they can easily watch the replay (which means more eyes on your brand). And people who attend the webinar that find the content valuable are likely to share it with their friends and colleagues—providing even more exposure for your business.

Here are three tips:\n1. Keep it relevant.\nYour audience will only tune in if they believe the content will be valuable to them—so make sure it is! To do this, get laser-focused on who your target audience is and what problems they're facing. Once you understand their issues, develop content that will speak directly to those pain points.\n2. Make it engaging.\nA live presentation requires…well…a presenter! That means it's up to you to\nbring the energy\nand keep things moving along. No one wants to listen to a monotone voice droning on for an hour. So, ensure you keep things interesting by varying your tone and delivery methods throughout the presentation (think: interactive overlays, recorded videos, etc.). Not only will this help keep things fresh for your audience, but it'll also prevent you from burning out halfway through.\n3. Promote, promote, promote!\nJust because you're hosting a digital event doesn't mean you can skimp on promotion. To ensure people show up, take some time beforehand to\nspread the word\nthrough email marketing campaigns, social media posts, and good old-fashioned word of mouth. The more eyeballs you have on your event, the better!\nAs a marketer, it's important to always be on the lookout for new lead-generation tactics—and webinars should definitely be on your radar. Webinars are an excellent way to build relationships with your target audience, qualify your leads, and generate high-quality leads.

Who wants to spend money on big, splashy campaigns when their company—and their customers—might be bracing for a down-turn?\nIf you’re looking for ways to navigate economic uncertainty, partner marketing is a worthwhile solution. Partnering up with a complementary brand is a low-cost way to expand your reach to new audiences, identify new prospects, and improve overall awareness of your brand.\nTruly aligned partnerships also allow you to meet potential customers where they are, minimizing the risk of your future campaigns.\nWhat is Partner Marketing?\nIn the B2B arena, partner marketing or\nco-marketing\n, requires establishing long-term relationships with like-minded brands that complement your business.\nThis means working together on mutually beneficial campaigns, events, or offerings to expand your reach and attract new prospects. Remember: you’re not hitching your wagon to a direct competitor. Instead, you’re working with a peer brand that is complementary to your product offering and has audience or customer overlap.\nFor example, Slack, a communication tool, regularly partners with a number of other services used in virtual and remote work. These services include Asana, which allows customers to assign and track tasks for their employees. Using an Asana integration in Slack helps customers of both services use each product more efficiently.\nWhile the Slack-Asana integration is a sophisticated example, any two brands can partner up to market their services more effectively. But partner marketing requires brand alignment—and a lot of work. Ultimately, it’s a long-term solution that takes time and effort to maintain, not a quick tactic to rush into.\nWhy B2B Partner Marketing Is Crucial in 2023\nAccording to\nForrester\n’s B2B marketing predictions, 2023 is gearing up to be a customer-focused year.\nGone are the times for the impersonal approaches of channel marketing. In fact, as many as\n40% of B2B brands are predicted to ditch channel marketing for marketing partnerships\nin 2023. Partner marketing helps B2B companies “align to buyer needs and preferences,” all while they focus on increasing their access to clients.\nStrategic marketing partnerships will also become increasingly important as competition for digital space increases. According to\nForbes\n,\nB2B spending on digital advertising is predicted to hit $15 billion next year\n.\nThanks to increased spending, B2B awareness campaigns will scrap for time, space, and attention on their digital channels. But partnering up with a like-minded brand means you’ll have a greater chance of breaking through the noise.\n7 Strategies for B2B Partner Marketing\nReady to get started on your own partner marketing strategy? Here are 7 tactics you can take to your B2B partner.\n1. Develop shared content\nWhether you guest post on another’s blogs or develop gated content together, sharing thought leadership is a great way to\nbuild brand awareness\nwith one another’s audiences.\nHere’s how to come up with topics that both of your audiences will be interested in:\nWhat shared problems, pain points, or concerns do your customers have?\nWhich industry best practices do your brands align on?\nDo you have any tips and tricks that could illuminate a niche problem area for your partner, or vice versa?\nIf your blog content performs well across both sites, this could be a sign to dig in. Consider investing in longer form content designed to generate leads, like:\neBooks\nWhite papers\nIndustry studies or research\nProduct comparisons\nChecklists\nSince these efforts require more time, energy, and money to produce, partnering with another brand can be a good way to share costs—and get the final product in front of a wider audience.\n2. Collaborate on social media\nCross-promoting campaigns, give-aways, or other co-developed social content will boost engagement and awareness across both brands. Don’t forget to:\nCreate graphics with co-branding\nDevelop a shared campaign hashtag\nInteract with one another’s posts by liking, commenting, and sharing to your own channels\nTrack and share both traffic and lead generation data with your partner\n‍\nStarting out small on social media can also be a great way to determine whether a potential partner’s audience is a great fit for your brand. If it’s a hit on LinkedIn, it might be time for your B2B marketing partnership to take the next step.\n3. Hold an event together\nWant to boost engagement and awareness across both audiences? Hold a virtual event, like a webinar, together.\nWebinars still drive a huge number of B2B leads. According to DemandGen,\n53% of B2B marketers\nthink that webinars generate the highest-quality leads. But webinars can be expensive and time-consuming to produce, which might be more challenging to justify in 2023.\nThankfully, webinar platforms like\nWelcome\nmake it easy to co-produce high-quality, lead-generating events, so you and your partners collect all the data you need to\nclose sales and drive pipeline\n.\n4. Use affiliate links\nAffiliate links, in which you and your partner agree to link to one another’s websites, products, or services, are a low-budget, low-commitment way to test drive your marketing partnership.\nBecause you can customize links using UTM tracking codes, this is also a great way to measure the success of a marketing partnership. How much traffic, including leads and sales, is your partner driving?\nIf your KPIs are strong, it could be a sign to deepen the partnership and move onto something more complex, like developing content or holding an event together.\n‍\n5. Start a referral program\nEstablishing customer trust is arguably even more important in B2B marketing than in B2C models. B2B buyers are often making major purchasing decisions for an entire organization, and the risk-to-reward ratio is high.\nBecause trust with B2B customers is hard-won, a\nreferral program\ncan work wonders in a B2B marketing partnership. When you partner with another business to share referrals, you’re more likely to bring in high-quality leads at a lower cost.\n‍\n6. Share leads\nLead sharing goes one step beyond a B2B referral program. Rather than simply referring current customers to one another’s businesses, both you and your partner work to qualify and share leads that come from your co-marketing activities.\nFor example, if you hold a\nwebinar\nthat you’ve co-marketed to both of your audiences, you’ll need a plan for sharing leads generated by the event. You’ll also need a detailed plan for your follow-up communications. In order not to overwhelm contacts with emails, work with your partner to sequentially manage outreach to your shared leads.\nRemember: sharing leads requires a lot of trust, great communication between your sales and marketing teams, and a very closely aligned partner. Planned with intention, this tactic can be a great way to grow your B2B customer base.\n7. Offer product discounts or bundles to shared customers\nIf your partner marketing efforts are going well and your businesses are aligned, you may find that both you and your B2B partner have an overlapping customer base. Better yet, you may have a large\npotential\noverlapping customer base.\nWhy not partner up to offer a product discount or bundle for your shared customers? If your businesses are complementary, this could be a great opportunity to win new B2B customers.\nFinal Thoughts\nB2B marketers work hard to earn the trust of their customers. In an uncertain time, trust helps build better business relationships—with customers and B2B brands alike.\nPartner up with a closely aligned B2B organization to share marketing costs, reduce risks, and generate more qualified leads with an engaged audience. Using\nWelcome\n, you can design and co-host engaging webinars with your B2B marketing partner, share leads and engagement data, and close sales that benefit you both.\nSchedule a demo\nwith Welcome today to learn more about our easy-to-use webinar platform for generating high-quality leads that will fuel your partnership strategy in 2023.\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops!

On the surface, it is, but if you want to maximize its potential, you will need to put in some forethought. Many people are running webinar events, in fact it happens to be the most common virtual event. That doesn’t mean we should trivialize how hard they are to execute successfully as we go through the critical elements of webinar planning. Not everything will apply to you, and that is okay. The article aims to highlight any areas you may have overlooked or undervalued. I would recommend you have some sort of organizational structure. Using a project management app or even a document to have all your plans organized in one place is advised. If you need a checklist to build off,\ncheckout an example\nof what we use.\nGoal\nYou need to create defined goals for your webinar. Consider what value you are trying to bring to your attendees and what you are trying to get out of it yourself. The outcomes you are looking for can range from increasing product demos to increasing newsletter signups. Understanding this will help you when it comes to structuring your webinar presentation.\nWhat is the webinar topic we are presenting to the audience? Does that topic bring them value? Does that value translate into your outcome goals?\nAs the purveyor, what are your outcome goals for the webinar? Setting specific goals and metrics that you can track will determine the overall success of your webinar. Our blog post about\nHow to measure the ROI of a Webinar\ncan give you some idea of where to start.\nAudience\nWho is the target audience? What are their needs?\nWrite out who is the ideal webinar attendee. Ask yourself why and how you provide the answers they are looking for. This will assist in determining who you are going to target for your marketing campaign.\nWhat are the specific skills and information they are seeking? This will assist in determining the content and the type of speakers you want to have in your webinars.\n‍\nContent + Format\nNow that you know what your webinar presentation will be and who your webinar attendees will be. It is time to start conceptualizing what the structure of your webinar will look like. Here is a basic outline you can build off of. This may seem like lots of extra work, but this will help in creating a successful webinar in the long term.\nMain topic\nGuest Speakers\nWebinar format - Determine how you want your information to be delivered to your target audience\nLecture\nPanel discussion\nAMA\nWebinar Structure - Build out your webinar agenda design and flow. Below is a basic structure you can build off of.\nOpen Doors\nIntroductions\nMain Session\nQ&A Session\nOutro\nClose Doors\nAssets - Creating custom assets will help elevate your webinar from just having a floating head on the stage.\nPowerpoint deck\nVideos\nGraphics such as overlays, backgrounds, and logos.\nHandouts: such as case studies and marketing material that you may want to share\nInteractive elements - These are fantastic engagement tools to help maintain the attendee's attention. We have a whole post (\nINSERT how would you design a webinar that would be interactive LINK\n)\nregarding the use of the elements that you should check out. Remember, in a virtual environment, you are competing for the attendee's attention.\nPolls\nQ&A\nCall to actions\nMarketing Strategy\nFormalize your marketing strategy for your target audience. This may vary depending on the demographics of who you are targeting. Please check out our article regarding\npromoting your webinar marketing best practices\n. Here is a brief list of items to consider for your marketing strategy.\nEmail Marketing\nSocial Media Campaigns\nCross Collaboration\nLanding page design\nLogistics\nEstablishing who is involved and what their responsibilities, setting a timeframe to have deliverables completed will help set expectations. A detailed and consolidated plan will relieve stress and confusion for everyone involved.\nDate and Time - Setting a date between Tuesday and Thursday are the most popular days of the week to host a webinar. Mid-morning and mid-afternoon are the most popular times of the day.\nEquipment needed - Nail-down equipment required. Remember to factor in time to test equipment.\nProduction team - List who is part of your production team and their responsibilities.\nLead Manager\nEmcee\nLive event producer\nAsset Designer\nMarketing Manager\nTimeline - Establish a timeline for deliverables for the life cycle of the webinar. You should include pre and post-event planning deliverables. Give yourself about eight weeks to plan out your webinar correctly. Allowing you enough time to get all your preparations and marketing strategy to be effective.\nRegistration - Establish how you want to receive your webinar registration. Many webinar platforms have their own built-in forms that can integrate into various CRMs like Hubspot and Marketo. Don’t forget to check out our blog post regarding boosting\nwebinar registration\n.\n‍\nThe Follow Up\nEstablish a post-event plan to continue the conversation with those that attended your event. Providing additional content post-webinar helps push conversion for attendees who are on the fence. At the minimum, you should have an email campaign for post event follow-up.\nRecording of the webinar\nSurvey\nAdditional Content\nAdditional Call to Actions\nCross-collaboration with other teams, such as ensuring post-event data is appropriately integrated into your CRM for your sales team to conduct post-event outreach.\nEvaluation\nThe event is over, and it is time to measure your efforts. During the goal-setting phase, you should have established what metrics and values you are looking for. Now is the time to review those values and evaluate your wins and losses. If this is your first webinar, don’t be hard on yourself if the outcomes are not what you expected. Brand awareness and trust take time; the best way to do that is to keep consistently producing more webinars. Each webinar will offer you new insights and new values that you look into measuring.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/webinar-planning-template\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

With increasingly sophisticated technology and consumer behaviors changing daily, understanding\nwhich marketing strategies\nwill give us an edge over the competition is more critical than ever. Armed with a proper understanding of marketing attribution and metrics, you can gain powerful insights into customer behavior that can help you make smarter decisions about where best to invest your resources—and\ngenerate maximum ROI\n.\nBut let's face it: there are so many myths out there when it comes to attribution models and performance metrics. We recently spoke with Julia Hartwig, VP of Marketing at\nCapchase\n, to debunk the top three myths surrounding marketing attribution and metric reporting in 2023.\nMissed this session? Read the summary below or\naccess the recording here\n.\nMyth #1 - You need more tech tools.\nNowadays, there's a digital marketing tool for everything. For analyzing traffic, increasing conversions, tracking heat maps, showing exit-intent popups, always-on chatbots, the list goes on and on. But having too many tech tools may actually be hurting your business. Each can be useful on its own, but when trying to track attribution properly, connecting conversions to specific sources can be a struggle.\nHartwig cautions against buying too many marketing tools and instead recommends focusing on getting the foundational elements of marketing operations in order. \" There are a million tools, but if your foundations in your house aren't built right, the more you add, the worse your attribution gets,\" says Hartwig. \"If you can't understand the simple stuff, adding more to it just makes it like data soup.\" At the very least, she says the following tools are essential:\nMarketing Automation (Hubspot or Marketo)\nCMS (Wordpress or Webflow)\nCustomer Data Platform (Segment)\nData Visualization Tool (Tableau)\nSometimes realizing less is more and ensuring the data can be easily pulled and analyzed will put you in a better position. Especially in this economy,  it's not ideal to be highly dependent on a set of tools, as managing them can be a lot of work.\nMyth #2 - ChatGPT can run my marketing team.\nHartwig says NO! She's skeptical about the effectiveness of AI in solving marketing problems. \"You can't AI your way out of a problem yet. AI isn't there,\" Hartwig says. \"AI is really good at doing an A to B line thing, living within a box. But you need to understand what you're putting into it if you're going to get anything out of it. I use Jasper.ai, but if you can't tell Jasper, I need you to write me exactly this post with this as the message line, and this is the kicker and the audience and everything I want. It's really just doing the writing and not doing the ideas.\"\nWelcome\n114 subscribers\nCan ChatGPT run your marketing team?\nWatch later\nShare\nCopy link\nInfo\nShopping\nTap to unmute\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\nYou're signed out\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

There is a time and place for AI in marketing. It can be a helpful tool for supporting creative development and helping marketers work on search, email, and social media marketing. However, marketers should be realistic about what AI tools like ChatGPT can do. We need to apply our own experience and knowledge when developing strategies, and we can't 100% rely on it for marketing copy. Although Google has loosened it's stance on AI-generated content, they have said that AI content is unlikely to feel written by people, without some degree of human review.\nDanny Sullivan\n·\nNov 7, 2022\n@\ndannysullivan\n·\nFollow\nReplying to\n@iPullRank\nWe haven't said AI content is bad. We've said, pretty clearly, content written primarily for search engines rather than humans is the issue. That's what we're focused on. If someone fires up 100 humans to write content just to rank, or fires up a spinner, or a AI, same issue...\nDanny Sullivan\n@dannysullivan\n·\nFollow\nWe did talk about a focus on content *by people* for people in our post about improvements like the helpful content system. But the nuance is really that it's unlikely some AI content is going to feel written by people without some degree of human review:\nblog.google\nMore content by people, for people in Search\nWe’re improving Search so you’re less likely to find content made primarily for search engines, and more likely to find helpful, authentic information.\n6:10 PM · Nov 7, 2022\n24\nReply\nCopy link\nRead 2 replies\n‍\nSo, although, ChatGPT is the life of the AI party right now, marketers should tread carefully when using it.\nMyth #3 - You need to spend money to make money.\nFalse! Hartwig says you need to spend\nsome\nmoney. \"You can't run a company without spending money, but I would spend that money on people. Humans are worth more; they're more valuable than data.\"\nShe explains that if you run a streamlined marketing team, the things that actually matter and make a difference are conducting research and having a good feedback loop when talking to customers. In addition to having a solid attribution system – you know what ads to run and what platforms give you the most bang for your buck.\nThis allows you to be a conservative marketer until you're ready to make big bets. Sometimes big bets in marketing can pay off, and sometimes they don't, but that's the name of the game in marketing.\nWelcome\n114 subscribers\nMarketing Attribution & Metrics Myth #3 -  You need to spend money to make money\nWatch later\nShare\nCopy link\nInfo\nShopping\nTap to unmute\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\nMore videos\nMore videos\nMake Your Virtual Events Jaw-Dropping - February 5, 2021\nWelcome • 1.8K views\n26:01\nAdweek: Creating Jaw-Dropping Virtual Events - January 28, 2021\nWelcome • 1.2K views\n24:18\nIs B2C the new B2B?

Before we dive into trends, let's ground ourselves as to what content marketing actually is. In short, content marketing is the creation and distribution of ANY form of content that would resonate with a company's target persona or ideal customer profile with the goal of generating brand awareness or educating the buyer.\n‍\nWhen thinking about your content marketing strategy, you need to consider three things:\nWill the messaging of my content resonate with the target audience?\nWhat content format should I use?\nWhat channels should I distribute the content through?\n‍\nContent & Messaging\nIt’s critical that the messaging of your content resonates with your target audience. Without clear messaging, it does not matter what format your content is or how well you distribute the content. You’ll be wasting time, money, and effort without first nailing this. The best way to get your messaging right is simple - have conversations with your target audience and decision-makers. Listen to the words they use, how they describe their current pains, and ask for feedback on the content you’re planning on creating.\n‍\nThere are a few ways to quickly test the messaging of your content, but it depends on your situation:\nIf buyers are already aware of your brand and you have some form of a following, posting on social media is a great way to see how your content will resonate (assuming your audience is on social media).\nIf your buyers are NOT on social media, and you have a large enough email database, email marketing is a great way to test your content for no cost.\nIf you have a high volume of website traffic to your site already, you can do A/B testing on your messaging on specific landing pages.\nIf you have none of the above, paid advertising such as LinkedIn Paid Ads or Google Search Paid Ads can give you quick insights.\n‍\nContent Format\nThere is a limit to the types of content formats you have at your disposal but choosing the right format can have major impacts. For example, short-form video typically performs 2-3x better than any other format on LinkedIn when it comes to impressions and engagement. But maybe your buyer doesn’t like video and prefers lengthy educational content- in that case, short-form may not have any material impact. So what are the forms of content you should consider? See some examples below:\n‍\nLong-form video\nWebinar or virtual event\nWebinar recording\nEducational videos\nProduct demonstrations\nTraining videos\nShort-form video\nClip of a conversation on a webinar\nPromo videos\n“How-to” videos\nProduct feature demonstrations\nLong-form text\nBlogs\nEducational landing pages\nIndustry reports\nCase studies\nShort-form text\nQuotes\nConversation summaries\nAudio\nPodcasts\nClips from podcasts\nVisual\nImages\nGraphics\nInfographics\nContent Distribution\nYou’ve nailed your messaging, and you’ve created content in what you believe to be the best format, now it's time for distribution. But how do you know where to distribute your content? If you’re continually having conversations with your target audience you should know WHERE they consume content. It’s also important to also nail down the FREQUENCY of content distribution for each of these marketing channels to avoid your marketing campaign from coming off as spammy or annoying. Below are some examples of distribution channels:\n‍\nEmail\nDirect Mail\nSocial Media Platforms (ex. LinkedIn)\nPaid Search\nPaid Ads\nWebsite\nSearch Engine Results (naturally, content impacts SEO)\nPodcasts Apps\nVirtual events/webinars\nIn-person events\nCommunities\nTelevision\nRadio\n‍\n‍\nContent Marketing Strategy Example Table\n‍\nContent Marketing Trends\nHeading into 2023, some new content marketing trends are emerging in the B2B marketing space. While trends tend to come and go, some of these tactics and strategies are bearing fruit for many organizations and have a strong return on investment.\n‍\nShort-Form Video Content\nWith the rise of Youtube Shorts and Tiktok, short-form video is beginning to dominate as the number one content format in 2023. There are many new\nmarketing tools\nthat have made video content creation easier than ever before- allowing B2B companies, not just B2C, to create video content at scale. Many companies are taking advantage of\nrepurposing their long-form content\ninto many pieces of short-form content. They’re making it more interactive, high-quality, and yield big results. If you already have a\nwebinar or virtual event program\n, implementing short-form video content into your overall marketing strategy is a no-brainer.\n‍\nValue-Add Content\nCreating content that immediately provides value to B2B buyers is becoming more and more common- and for good reason. Today’s B2B buyer is doing a lot of research on their own before ever requesting a product demo or making a purchase decision. They have a problem and want a solution.  But sometimes they don’t NEED your product, or any product, but rather just an answer or some guidance. This is where value-add content comes in. Providing potential customers with answers, guidance, strategies, and ideas is still valuable to them. Over time your buyer will associate your product or company as a trusted source and leader in the space so that when they DO have a problem your solution solves, you’ll be first on the list for them to evaluate.\n‍\nInteractive Content\nInteractive content has always existed but new technologies are taking it to a whole new level. Digital marketing teams are now building hyper-engaging experiences for their target audience - interactive product demos and self-guided tours, business calculators, and moving content from a PDF to a dynamic landing page. All of these examples allow a company to tell a more robust story about its product and how it can help solve the buyer's problem. Organizations that have the resources to focus their marketing efforts here have seen many of their performance metrics improve (time on page, conversion rates, acquisition costs, etc).\n‍\nWrap-Up\nThere are still some marketing trends from last year that are continuing to grow, such as influencer marketing, but for 2023 interactive content, value-add content, and short-form video content will be the trends that grow the most and likely what sets apart B2B brands and organizations. As mentioned above, before trying any of these marketing strategies or trends, make sure you deeply understand who your buyer is, what they care about, and nail your messaging.\n‍\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/b2b-content-marketing-trends\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

With the right data, you can determine lead quality, attribute sales to your efforts, and make an air-tight case for your webinar budget.\n4 Tactics for Demonstrating Webinar ROI\nIf measuring webinar ROI is still a major challenge for your team, you're not alone.\n64% of B2B marketers\nsay their ability to demonstrate the value of their content marketing efforts is only average—or worse.\nHere are the four strategies you should implement to demonstrate the ROI of your webinars and virtual events:\nTrack the source of webinar registrations\nAttracting webinar attendees takes time, effort, and often money—in the form of attractive design work, email campaigns, and paid media.\nGiven how many channels you're using to promote each webinar, it's important to know\nwhich\nchannel gave your webinar the biggest boost in turnout.\nUTM tracking codes\nare snippets of code in URLs that track which channel was the most effective in reaching—and converting—webinar registrants.\nTo accurately measure your overall spend and assess your budget for next time, you'll need to know how much money and effort went into each marketing channel. UTM tracking is the perfect way to do just that.\nTally up all costs of spend\nHosting a webinar comes with a price tag. Regardless of your budget, be sure to track all the expenses that went into making your virtual event a success. These expenses include:\nAdvertising costs\n, like paid ads or media.\nBoosting a Facebook post\nRunning a LinkedIn campaign\nSponsoring a blog post on a partner's website\nProduction costs also add up quickly. Here are a few to consider:\nDid you hire a graphic designer to make flawless slides?\nA video editor to help with post-production for on-demand services?\nEngage a production agency to help you manage run-of-show?\nThankfully, new webinar platforms like\nWelcome\ncan help you streamline production costs. With in-platform tools for designing, editing, and hosting professional events, Welcome offers B2B marketers one way to consolidate costs—and boost their ROI for every event.\n‍\nDetermine Lead Quality\nOne of the major benefits of holding webinars is\ngenerating qualified leads\n. As soon as a lead registers for your event, you receive key details, including where they work or their role at a specific company. And, depending on your webinar content, you'll know exactly where they are in their\ncustomer journey\n.\nWith the right webinar platform, you can also track additional metrics to determine the overall quality of the leads generated from each webinar. These metrics include:\nEngagement\n.\nHow engaged was your lead\nin responding to polls during the webinar? Did they ask a question during Live Q&A? Are they still opening and clicking on your promotional emails now that the webinar is over? And, most importantly, did they click on your call-to-action at the end of the event?\nContent assets downloaded.\nDownloading assets would typically be considered a \"soft\" KPI. But this is still integral information for your sales team to have—and for you to assess the success of any content supporting your webinar topic. You may even wish to assign more value to download a \"high intent\" piece of content, like a comparison or pricing sheet.\nDemo requests.\nHow many leads requested a product demo after attending your webinar?\nMeetings booked.\nHow many leads requested a sales call or meeting after attending your webinar?\nOverall lead score.\nWhile every company generates\nlead scores\ndifferently, all the actions a lead takes before, during, and after a webinar can help you determine where they fall in the buyer's journey and how likely they are to become a customer. How many high-scoring leads does each of your webinars generate?\nThe more qualified leads you drive to the sales team from your webinars, the more valuable your event content is. The right\nwebinar platform\nwill give you a detailed picture of overall attendee engagement, including their interaction with your CTAs. This way, you can know you're\ndriving highly qualified leads to your sales team\nfrom every webinar you host.\nPlanning a webinar? Check out the\nWebinar Best Practices Guide\nto ensure your webinar program is a success!\nAttribute sales and revenue back to your webinar\nThe best webinar platforms integrate seamlessly with your existing customer relationship management (CRM) software, giving you engagement and sales data at your fingertips.\nWith\nWelcome\n, you'll receive deep, account-level insights about each webinar attendee to help your sales team know who to follow up with and how to kick off each conversation.\nBecause our webinar platform is designed with B2B marketers in mind, we also help you track and measure:\nNet new pipeline from every virtual event\nThe number of closed-won opportunities from each webinar\nAnd the total amount of closed-won revenue generated by your webinars\nWith data like this, you'll never scramble to prove webinar ROI again!\n3 \"Soft\" KPIs that Demonstrate the Value of Virtual Events\nWe know how important real numbers are for calculating ROI. But any good marketer should also track \"softer\" key performance indicators (KPIs), from\nengagement\nto content downloads, to provide a more holistic view of their marketing efforts.\nHere are three KPIs you should keep top of mind:\nWebinar engagement scores\nWith the right webinar platform, you can measure engagement scores for individual leads. But it's also important to understand\noverall engagement\nduring your webinar:\nHow engaged was your audience throughout the event?\nDid audience members start dropping off at any point during the presentation? Or during a specific point in the on-demand video?\nDid the most engaged leads follow the customer journey, from clicking CTAs to setting up product demos? What actions did they take?\nUnderstanding how engaging your webinar was can help you optimize future event content and support the sales team's needs once your webinar is over.\n‍\nConversion rates\nFor every webinar, there are multiple conversion rates. First: how effectively did you transform a user into a webinar attendee?\nAfter all, before converting a webinar attendee into a paying customer, you need them to register for your event! (Looking for advice on how to\nboost your webinar registration numbers\n? We got you.)\nYou'll also want to attribute any product demo or sales meetings to your webinar. How many attendees became leads or customers? What throughlines do you see in the data from registration to product demo requests? Each of these conversion rates will help you make a case for ROI.\nMetrics across each promotional channel\nChances are you're promoting each of your virtual events through multiple channels, from email marketing to the social media feeds of your webinar partners.\nTo make a case for your efforts—and to know where to spend your time in the future—track and compare metrics across every promotional channel you have. Benchmarks for each channel should include the following:\nThe number of webinar registrations\nThe number of leads generated from your live event vs. on-demand video\nThe number of content assets downloaded directly from the webinar\nThe number of demo requests submitted directly from your webinar\nThe number of meetings booked as a result of your event.\nWhile \"soft\" KPIs aren't a leading indicator for ROI, they can support your overall efforts for attribution. Tracking and measuring these indicators will help your sales team understand account-level metrics, target leads for follow-up touchpoints, and personalize their outreach. So keep your spreadsheets handy!\nFinal Thoughts\nWithout the right tools, tracking the ROI of your webinars is downright challenging. Thankfully, we built\nWelcome\nwith B2B marketers in mind.

Webinars are a perfect delivery system for top-of-funnel, educational content that shows your audience exactly how well you understand their needs and challenges.\nBut putting energy into B2B content can also create many lackluster articles, social media posts, and more—just to keep up with your competitors' volume. In fact,\nForrester's 2021 Content Preferences survey\nshows that 64% of global technology buyers think marketers produce\ntoo much\ncontent.\nThe solution? Instead of chasing volume, go for quality. By repurposing the excellent content created during your virtual events and webinars, you'll deliver high-quality content without straining your resources.\nBelow, we'll show you why repurposing content is a great digital marketing strategy—and offer some creative solutions to make it work, no matter the size of your team.\nThe Benefits of Repurposing Content\nIn B2B marketing, we're always looking for ways to improve the ROI of our efforts. In some cases, measurable ROI can mean the difference between a robust marketing budget and a shoestring operation.\nWhether you're a legacy brand or a lean start-up, repurposing content from your virtual events helps you:\n‍\nIncrease the ROI of your webinars\nand\ncontent marketing efforts.\nRepurposing webinar content is a great way to get more bang for your buck—and to make a case for offering webinars that convert. Whether you create short-form social content, blog posts, or a podcast from your event recording, virtual events provide many opportunities to break up and repackage content for different channels.\nAfter all, when your events and content marketing efforts are aligned, they feed one another. This speeds up content production and reduces your costs across departments and channels. It's a win-win!\n‍\nIncrease metrics for social media and conversion rates on your website.\nOne of the best parts of holding a virtual event like a webinar is having high-quality video content afterward. According to the\nDigital Agency Network\n, well-placed video content increases on-page conversions by as much as 80%. Embed the video within your blog content, landing pages, or social media posts to see an instant boost.\nCreate strategic alignment across all your channels.\nWhether trying to increase brand awareness or draw attention to your current offerings, repurposing content across channels keeps all your teams strategically aligned. Holistically support your content, social, and event marketing strategies by creating and sharing content from all your channels—including recently recorded webinars.\nBoost registration numbers for future events.\nRepackaging content from your webinars is also a great way to increase engagement on social media channels like LinkedIn and Twitter. Showcase your content from your virtual events, including video clips and insights, to create a sense of FOMO and\nincrease your registration numbers for future webinars\n.\n8 Creative Ways to Reuse Content from Your Virtual Events\nLooking for some creative ways to repurpose your virtual event content? Here are 8 ideas you can add to your content planning doc as you plan and promote your next webinar.\nCreate short-form social content\nWhether you create video clips from a virtual roundtable or use insights from your panel to design an infographic, webinars are a gold mine for\nshort-form social media content\n.\nThis content has the added benefit of aligning your brand across social media and marketing outreach efforts, generating brand awareness and FOMO for your upcoming webinars.\nAt\nWelcome\n, for example, we work across our marketing and events teams to create short video clips and graphics for our social channels.

Check out the\nWebinar Best Practices Guide\nto ensure your webinar program is a success!\nTurn your event transcript into a blog post\nWebinars are jam-packed with insights from guest speakers and members of your team. Use them to fill your blog with high-impact content by creating a blog post from the event transcript. Basing the blog post on the transcript will also cut down on content production time and increase the overall ROI of your event.\nFrom a brand perspective, transforming your event into blog content helps you \"own\" the topic of your webinar online and generate SEO equity. Not only can you increase organic traffic to your website, but you can also build additional trust with your audience by writing and publishing thought-leadership content.\nLast but not least, blog posts create an additional channel for lead generation. Embed a sign-up form on your page or direct leads to the event replay landing page to\nboost registration numbers for future virtual events\n.\nHit the airwaves with a new podcast episode\nYou're already planning to create video clips for social media. But remember—webinars generate audio files, too!\nWhether you already host a brand podcast or you're looking for a low-cost way to enter the space, audio from your virtual event can be edited into a brand-aligned podcast episode.\nBuild an on-demand video library\n70% of B2B professionals\nlook to webinars for industry tips and tricks. Additionally,\n30% of event registrants\nprefer to watch webinar content after the live event.\nFor a content marketer, this is an exciting equation. You can support both of these needs with an on-demand video library of all your event content.\nNot only can you improve your SEO with a landing page for each video, but landing pages with embedded forms or strong CTAs can also\nhelp your sales team capture more leads\n.\n‍\nPartner with sales to nurture more leads\nAs a great event marketer, you know that the content generation process doesn't stop once your event is over. All sales teams need content to close deals and nurture leads who need more time to be ready to buy.\nYour webinar can be a great source of insights for\nlead-nurturing campaigns\n. Pop-out impactful quotes, statistics, or helpful tips for your sales team. Together, you can create campaigns that work hand-in-hand with your social and on-demand video content to support leads along the buyer's journey.\nPitch the topic to an industry blog\nYou've already created blog posts and catchy graphics on social media, making you an expert on your\nwebinar topic\n. Increase your reach by publishing supportive thought leadership with another outlet, whether that's an opinion page or an industry blog.\nThis may take extra planning, from pitching the right outlet to developing a related article without cannibalizing your webinar content. But the payoff comes in expanding your readership, solidifying your status as a thought leader, and increasing your overall brand awareness. Which outlet might work for your brand?\nThink big: case studies, white papers, and other major assets\nEvents are often the tip of a content iceberg. If your event performed especially well, you likely have a content-building block on your hands.\nWith some additional research and content strategy elbow grease, you could create:\nRelated blog content and a pillar page\n. Is your webinar content integral to your business model? Begin to own SEO on a specific search term by creating a\ntopic cluster\nof related blog posts and a longer\npillar page\n. Not only will this increase your organic traffic, but it will also bolster your brand's position as an expert in the space.\nA customer case study\n. Showcase how a customer or client uses your product to solve the challenges from your webinar with a customer case study. Case studies are great bottom-of-the-funnel content and can help boost product demonstration conversions or sales!\nA white paper\n. Dive deeper into the research related to your webinar topic to demonstrate your brand's understanding of related challenges and opportunities in your industry. While white papers are a bigger commitment in terms of time and resources, they can also be incredible assets for capturing leads or closing sales.\nUse event analytics and audience questions to develop new content and event ideas\nIs your content well running dry? Don't forget to use event analytics and audience questions to inspire new content areas for exploration.\nAudience questions and\npoll responses\nhelp you understand where your audience is and what's top of mind. They may also point to new or more nuanced needs or challenges you can address through blog content or another webinar.\nEvent analytics\nare also illuminating indicators of your audience's attention. Did you have a significant drop-off at a certain point in the event? Or is there a point when your on-demand audiences click away from the video replay? Use analytics to fine-tune your content plan and re-imagine how to keep your audience's interest—or solve their biggest challenges.\n‍\nFinal Thoughts\nIt can be challenging to prove the ROI of B2B marketing, but webinars offer a unique opportunity to generate leads, improve sales, and simplify the content production process.\nWelcome\nis a webinar platform built with B2B marketers in mind.

Still, most respondents didn’t have a budget to match the company’s priorities.\nAs markets fluctuate and uncertainty looms, brand marketing budgets and goals are more in flux. You might be struggling to keep your budget, prove the ROI of your efforts, and successfully grow the reach of your campaigns on a shoestring.\nBelow, we lay out the value of investing in B2B brand awareness and suggest 5 cost-effective tactics you can use to ensure the success of your campaigns—all while supporting pipeline growth in 2023.\nThe Value of B2B Brand Awareness in Times of Uncertainty\nIn times of uncertainty, marketing budgets are first on the chopping block. This seems to make sense if you’re chasing the short-term dollar to keep your company afloat. Demand generation produces pipeline, so why not concentrate your efforts on the marketing tactics that immediately generate revenue?\nUnfortunately, in B2B marketing, focusing all of your efforts on demand generation won’t yield big results in the long term. Our products and services represent bigger investments for our accounts, and lead times are long.\nIn fact,\n95% of B2B buyers aren’t in the market\nfor your products or services at any time. That means all your demand generation efforts are only ever successful for 5% of your potential customer base. Unless you’re a household name, the clients who need your products or services six months in the future might forget you even exist.\nInvesting in B2B brand awareness is the only way to guarantee long-term success in growing your revenue. And, at a time when other brands are cutting their ad and marketing budgets, maintaining or increasing your presence in the market with B2B awareness campaigns will help you stand out from the crowd. You might even dominate it!\n5 Cost-Effective Ways to Build Brand Awareness in 2023\nThese cost-effective tactics will help you continue to build brand awareness in 2023—even if you’re faced with delivering big results on a shrinking budget.\nTarget the Right Audience\nTrying to target too many accounts with a B2B awareness campaign is a waste of time, money, and energy. You’ll never see the return on your investment, and you can’t afford to waste your marketing budget in times like this.\nInstead, fit the audience to your budget by weeding out the unlikely accounts to buy your products or services.\nUse current account lists, personas, and verticals to identify a healthy mix of accounts to target.\nUse\naudience segmentation tools\nin LinkedIn to target the right companies, job titles, or interests that will drive engagement and results.\nTry different combinations of target accounts, personas, and industries to fine-tune and test your efforts.\nMaximize the Frequency of Your Awareness Campaigns—Not the Reach\nDo you know how often a potential prospect has to see one of your campaigns before its brand awareness improves? Or how many impressions it takes for a lead to convert?\nIf the answer is no, it’s time to crunch some numbers on your old campaigns. To maximize your spend in 2023, you should know exactly how many impressions it takes each quarter to make an impact on brand awareness.\nMax Massingill, VP of Activation at Transmission, says the best frequency target for B2B awareness campaigns is\n18-25 times per quarter\n, per account. By limiting your audience, you’re more likely to “breakthrough” to the potential accounts that matter to your brand.\nOtherwise, you risk over-extending your reach—ensuring no one remembers who you are.\nExplore Up-and-Coming Social Channels\nAs you “right size” your audience to make an impact with potential customers, don’t underestimate the value of advertising on alternative social media channels.\nYour competitors likely eat up space on LinkedIn, generating\n80% of B2B marketing leads\n. But under-utilized social channels for B2B marketers, like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, can also be excellent tools for building brand awareness.\nIn particular, platforms like TikTok provide B2B marketers with opportunities to create\nshort-form video content that drives engagement\n. From product demos and tutorials to expert advice, short-form video converts. Plus, you can re-use this content across other platforms—including your blog, LinkedIn page, or email campaigns.\nWelcome\n4,384 followers\n1mo\nEdited\nThis week, we sat down with\nLatané Conant (she/her)\n, CMO of\n6sense\n, to talk about recession-proofing your\n#marketingstrategy\n. \n\nDuring changing market conditions, she says to focus on 3 things:\n\n👤 ICP\n💬 Message\n☑️ Execution\n\nThose are the things that we can control. \n\nDo you agree?

That way, you’ll immediately see the ROI of every partnership—and be able to follow up with new leads ASAP.\nAmp Up Your Creative\nYou’ve fine-tuned your audience, allocated a budget to break through with new accounts, and partnered with other industry leaders to maximize your reach. But you’re unlikely to make much of an impression without creative design to support your brand awareness campaign.\nAccording to Hubspot,\n80% of decision-makers\nprefer getting brand content from an article versus an ad. This means your content marketing efforts have to be in place before you run a brand awareness campaign—and they need to match the B2B customer journey.\nAwareness content for B2B customers is slightly different than in B2C industries. It includes:\nChecklists\nWhite papers\nIndustry reports\nWebinars\nAnd informative short-form video\nWith stronger content marketing and creative, you’ll make an impression on your target B2B audience—and support their unique journey to becoming a paying customer.\nAttributing Pipeline to Your Awareness Campaigns\nLet’s face it. There’s a lot of pressure on B2B marketers to deliver tangible results in an uncertain market. That includes designing brand awareness campaigns that contribute directly to pipeline and revenue—even when that’s not the immediate purpose of brand awareness!\nHere are two easy tactics you can use to\nprove the ROI\nof your efforts—and maintain or increase your budget in 2023 for better long-term results:\n‍\n1. Use a control group for your awareness campaigns\nFor any campaign you run, use a control group to determine which leads—or how much revenue—was generated from your awareness campaign.\nTally up all the leads and revenue from targeted accounts and compare them to the leads or revenue generated by non-targeted accounts.\nWhat’s the difference? Hopefully, it’s a notable one—and a percentage increase that you can use to demonstrate the effectiveness of your work.\n2. Track new leads, product demos, meetings, or revenue generated across channels\nSome awareness campaigns, like webinars and virtual events, are high-converters. For example,\n62% of webinar attendees\nrequest a product demo after attending. Do you know what your conversion rate is? Own it!\nUse your\nwebinar platform\nto track net new pipeline, closed-won opportunities, and closed-won revenue.\nAs pressure mounts on B2B marketers to deliver, the tension between shouldering big responsibilities for your brand with a small budget will only increase. It might not be the same as conducting a brand study, but\nattributing any pipeline or revenue\nback to your awareness campaigns will help you stay in the game in 2023.\nFinal Thoughts\nAs brands cut budgets for awareness campaigns and other B2B marketing efforts, staying in the game will help you stand out in 2023. Cost-effective tactics for targeting your audience, partnering with other industry leaders, and developing solid creative ensure that your company will be top-of-mind when it’s finally time for them to invest in your products or services.\nWe built\nWelcome\nwith B2B marketers like you in mind.

You’ve probably seen hundreds of articles detailing every small difference between the two, but at the end of the day, these two terms are used interchangeably. The real question is: why are both of these terms important, and what does it mean for your marketing strategy? In this article, we’ll talk about why marketing is undergoing a fundamental paradigm shift, and how you can prepare for it.\nDefining the Terms\n‍\nFirst, let’s define what people generally mean by growth marketing and demand generation. Growth marketing typically focuses on driving sustainable, long-term growth for a business. This includes focusing not only on marketing, but user acquisition, qualified leads, and overall business growth. Demand gen typically focuses specifically on generating qualified leads and new customers. This can include social media, email marketing, and lead generation. In practice, though, there is a significant overlap between the two disciplines. Both roles are concerned with things like metrics, customer acquisition, and conversion rates. This has often created confusion when hiring someone for this role. At\nWelcome\n, our LinkedIn job openings have often used these terms interchangeably.\n‍\nTo understand this confusion, it’s important to recognize where these terms came from. In the old days, all digital marketing was essentially brand marketing. The goal was to create and maintain a strong brand identity. This was done through things like public relations, advertising, and events. The problem was, it was very difficult to tell what impact each individual marketing activity had on the bottom line.\n‍\nDuring its early years,\nFacebook\ntook a different approach. They created a growth team that was tasked with using data and engineering principles to grow their business. Most of the growth team members were not actually marketers, but data scientists and engineers. This experiment was controversial at the time, but the results are undeniable. By eschewing traditional brand marketing and focusing on optimization, they created one of the fastest-growing businesses in history. This was no accident. Now, nearly every company tries to copy these techniques.\n‍\nThough Facebook was a consumer startup at the time, many SAAS companies have taken the growth hacking mentality and applied it to the B2B world. The buyer’s journey may be different in b2b marketing, but the same marketing tactics can still apply.\n‍\nWhy Brand Marketing can be inefficient\n‍\nBrand marketing is not applicable to the majority of marketers today for a very simple reason: most companies do not have a brand. Unless you are one of the top 2 or 3 players in your space, no one really knows who you are. So it’s a losing battle to focus on your brand identity when your larger competitors already have an advantage. As your company grows and gains customers, it will naturally develop a brand, but focusing on that in the early days will not help.\n‍\nThe key to driving growth in today’s digital age is to exploit the blind spots in your competitors. The only way to do this is to take a data-driven approach to all of your marketing activities. Take content, for example. Thanks to HubSpot, content marketing is a default strategy for many companies. But often, that just results in every company writing the same content for the same buyer. To stand out from the noise, it’s important to make sure your content is relevant and unique. A brand marketing approach emphasizes each piece of content adhering to the overall brand vision and tone. In growth marketing, that’s less important. How your content ranks on search engines like Google takes priority. Investing in SEO is a must if you want to reach your target audience. Don’t get me wrong, creating brand awareness is important, but the best way to build awareness involves implementing demand-generation tactics.\nHow to not get left behind\n‍\nTo avoid getting left behind, marketers need to understand the importance of data and fast iteration. Speed kills in today’s environment. The faster you can iterate on marketing campaigns, the faster you can learn. Don’t strive for perfection the first time around. Upload that blog post before you’re ready. Submit that video even if it’s not pixel-perfect. AI-powered content creation tools like\nJasper\n(for text) or\nWelcome\n(for video) can drastically reduce your cycle times. The faster you can reach potential customers, the more your sales team will thank you. Don’t get caught up in analysis paralysis. There are many strategies that can work. I’ve seen referral programs, ABM, and webinars all be very successful in the customer journey.\n‍\nIn the current economic environment, retention is becoming a higher demand generation marketing priority. Making sure that leads are high-quality is becoming increasingly important. Case studies have long shown that it is easier to retain a customer than get a new one. Even though retention isn’t typically part of the marketing function, many CEOs are making it a part of their marketing efforts. This requires a careful, data-driven analysis of your inbound marketing strategy.\n‍\nThis starts with understanding your persona and its pain points. Often, your growth marketing strategy will hinge on key differences between your offering and that of your competitors. Because of this, traditional marketing is becoming increasingly irrelevant.\n‍\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops!

The key is to understand why both of these strategies are important and how they can impact the success of your marketing team going forward.\n‍\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/growth-marketing-vs-demand-generation\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

In fact, it can cost as much as\n7x more to acquire a new customer\nthan to retain an existing one.\nIn 2023, balancing customer retention efforts with acquisition will pay your marketing budget back in dividends. That’s where customer marketing comes in. Customer marketing helps you forge loyal customers and sell additional business to those who are already happy with your products and services.\nAs we face an economic downturn, customer marketing is important in your overall B2B marketing strategy and marketing efforts. Use the customer marketing strategies below to retain customers, build brand loyalty, and grow your existing revenue—even if the future looks uncertain.\nWant to learn more about customer marketing strategies? Watch our webinar replay!\nhttps://app.experiencewelcome.com/events/7XuQRz/stages/jrfkVW\nWhat is customer marketing?\nCustomer marketing\nis the practice of marketing directly to your existing customer base rather than marketing to prospective customers.\nThe goals of customer marketing are to improve customer experience and convince your current customers who already love your products and services to:\nTry the new products or services that you develop\nUpgrade their existing services with your business\nTell other people in their networks about your business,\nbuilding brand awareness\nand potentially expanding your customer base.\nThe last point is key to the long-term success of your B2B business. According to\nReferral Rock\n, 84% of B2B decision makers use referrals to determine whether to start the sales process with another business.\nIn short, it pays to invest in keeping your customers happy, loyal, and willing to talk you up to their networks.\nHow does customer marketing build brand loyalty?\nSuccessful customer marketing requires a nuanced understanding of your customers’ needs, challenges, and pain points. By demonstrating that you understand and care about your existing customers, you’ll build additional trust with them over time.\nIn addition to building trust through empathy, customer marketing also requires making an investment in customer service and customer retention. (We’ll get into that below!) You’ll need infrastructure to support your existing customers, listen to their feedback, and keep them coming back to the solutions you offer.\nUltimately, customer marketing is a user-centered approach that:\nDemonstrates empathy and builds trust\nRewards customer loyalty\nSupports customer service models, and\nResponds to customer feedback\nWhen customers feel supported, have meaningful ways to deliver feedback, and receive rewards for their continued engagement, you build brand loyalty.\nWhy are customer marketing and strong brand loyalty so important for 2023?\nAs the markets fluctuate,\nacquiring new customers becomes more challenging\n. Don’t axe your B2B marketing or digital marketing budget in anticipation of a potential economic downtown. Instead, pivot some of your marketing budget toward customer marketing, so you can:\nMinimize risks.\nRemember: you already know and understand your existing customers and their needs. That’s how you won their business in the first place! Customers who have already purchased from you once are more likely to repeat their business, or upgrade their services in the future. Marketing directly to them minimizes the risks of trying new tactics to attract new customers.\nSave marketing budget.\nIf you’re spending a little less on lead acquisition efforts in a tough economy, then you have room to support existing customers, build brand loyalty, and increase brand awareness—tactics that support long-term growth.\nImprove retention.\nCustomer marketing tactics also improve retention. If B2B customers are eyeing their budgets and deciding to hold off on a major purchase this year, a higher customer retention rate might make or break your bottom line. In a tough climate, the last thing you want to do is move backward.\n5 customer marketing tactics you can use to build brand loyalty\nAre you ready to integrate customer marketing into your B2B strategy this year? Here are five tactics you can use ASAP.\n1. Customer training\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS) models are complex tools for users, especially in the B2B arena. By offering free customer training, you’ll add value, solve real customer needs, and create a stronger end user of your product.\nSkill-building and education are also an important element of building brand loyalty, especially for B2B customers. From webinars to work reviews, B2B customers want to be educated about industry challenges to perform their jobs more effectively.\nAdvice from experts, easy-to-follow tutorials, and\nlive webinar platforms\nfor delivering engaging customer training continent are crucial marketing investments in 2023.\n2. New feature demos\nYour existing customers should be the first users who see your product’s new features. Not only will this reward their customer loyalty, but it also reinforces the value of your services.\nAfter all, when you demonstrate new products, features, or services that meet customer needs, you’re showing your users that you listen to customer feedback and apply it to your product. What’s more powerful than that?\n3. Customer appreciation events\nSome customer marketing tactics stick around for a reason—they work! Amp up your customer appreciation events in 2023 to reward customer loyalty, engage existing customers, and collect feedback.\nExclusive panels, fireside chats, or fun experiential events can educate and entertain your best customers. With the\nright tools for virtual events\n, you can also provide an unforgettable brand experience that leaves customers wanting more—without breaking the bank.\nWebinar platforms like\nWelcome\n, for example, make it easy to produce high-quality events that engage your loyal customer base and collect meaningful feedback. With deep analytics on engagement, you’ll have all the data you need to fine-tune your customer marketing campaigns and retain more customers.\n4. Stronger customer service\nIf your marketing and customer service teams operate in silos, 2023 is the year to break down those walls. Investing in stronger customer service will help you retain existing customers through a downturn. But sharing insights across marketing and customer success teams is where the real magic lies.\nInsights from customer service strategy should inform your buyer personas, customer marketing campaigns, and your products. Now is the time to systematize how your teams will work together to collect, analyze, and apply customer feedback in meaningful ways across the company.\n5. Customer referral program\nCustomer referrals have a lot of weight. After all, people only refer their networks to businesses that they trust, value, and like. If we’re in a down market, the trust of your existing customers is worth its weight in gold—not least because it could introduce you to qualified new business.\nA\ncustomer referral program\nleverages your positive relationship with your existing customers to grow your customer base and partnerships. Whether you simply ask for referrals through a straightforward email campaign or offer an incentive like a discount, a customer referral program could be the key to driving word-of-mouth business in a tough year.\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops!

How can companies optimize demand generation for B2B marketing in today’s budget-minded environment?\nFirst, let’s make sure we understand the difference between demand generation and lead generation. Demand generation is about\nraising brand awareness\nand\ncreating demand\nfor your product. Lead generation focuses on conversion rates; nurturing your engaged target audience into MQLs. Ideally, demand generation will create high-quality leads that can be sent to your Sales team for follow-up.\nSo where should your marketing team start for a demand generation strategy that will result in qualified leads for your sales teams?\nStart, as they say, from the beginning. Look at your\nproduct-market fit\n. Do you have a product that solves a pain point, which people will pay to use? If the answer is yes, move on to your ICP (ideal customer profile). Where is your target audience hanging out? What type of content are they looking at?\nAnalyze your sales funnel and customize your marketing efforts to reach your personas at the appropriate moment in the sales cycle.\nWho\nis looking at\nwhat\nand\nwhen\n;\nwhy\nare they looking? Make sure your marketing campaign accurately captures what generates the most ROI and best leads at each stage. Having a predictable and scalable solution to your target personas’ problems and needs, when they need them, will ensure your demand generation campaigns make sense\nand\nmoney.\nSet up a lead scoring system so your inbound marketing efforts are finely honed. Don’t waste time and effort on bad fits. Measure your success with performance metrics: track your KPIs, conversion cost, funnel time and spend results.\nOnce you have your plan in place, you need to establish your voice with\nvalue and trust\n. To do this, your brand has to be on point and consistent. Don’t silo your\nSEO and account-based marketing efforts\n. Align your sales and marketing teams on the mission statement and make that mission obvious to potential customers and decision-makers. Household names didn’t gain brand recognition by changing their own personas constantly!\nTo gain value and trust, focus on\nquality over quantity.\nYour demand generation campaign should be smart, lean and effective - the same should go for your content creation.\nQuality, original content marketing\nwill differentiate your brand. Take the time and effort to create a high-value asset, but make that asset work for you in more ways than one. If you host a webinar* or podcast, capture hot clips and distribute them across social media (one influencer is all it takes to go viral sometimes). Create a call to action (CTAs) to access white papers and case studies from the webinar, but post them on your website as well. You can gate access to these high-value assets but don’t make it too complicated.\nRemember that new leads and new customers won’t always be immediate. B2B lead generation relies on both long and short-term plays. Lead generation campaigns to nurture leads are still effective. Automated drip and re-marketing campaigns can keep your brand top of mind when a buyer persona is ready to make a decision.\nUltimately, your demand gen strategy should confront your target accounts starting at the top of the funnel all the way down. If you take the time to do your research and execute a smart demand generation campaign, you will see results that impact your bottom line tremendously.\n*Create captivating webinars, drive registration and attendance, and ensure your webinar program is a success - free download available\nhere\n.\n‍\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/b2b-demand-generation-best-practices\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

You might think that reeling back your marketing campaigns and initiatives is the smart thing to do in this case. What is the best way to stay on top and hold on to market share with your marketing efforts?\nThe key is not to market less, but to be smarter with your marketing tactics. Below are some important things to consider with your marketing teams for your 2023 b2b marketing strategy.\nDon’t stop!\nWhile other companies may be pulling back on their digital marketing efforts, this is the perfect time to stay top of mind with your customer base. When people emerge from an economic recession, you want to be the brand that new customers have in mind for their marketing needs when they are ready to make purchase decisions.\nMake friends\n. A great cost-effective way to drum up new business is to partner up with a Subject Matter Expert for your target audience. Thought leadership from a trusted source provides value - host a fireside chat webinar, and provide a whitepaper after the event.\nMake it a party\non social media! If you host a webinar or podcast, don’t let that be the end of it. Use automation to distribute your message to b2b companies all over social; leverage it on a Linkedin post (the LinkedIn algorithm favors posts from personal profiles over business profiles).\nAppreciate\n(and expand)\nwhat you already have\n. Your current customers are a huge opportunity for increased value. Make their customer experience outstanding. Offer them early access to your shiny new products, give them exclusive promotions, stay in touch and make sure they know you love and appreciate them. Current customers are the key to new business referrals that get bodies in the door with skyrocketing trust already instilled.\nBe a good student\n. Your customers are doing this, and so should you - and not just during an economic recession. Constantly audit your KPIs, measure those metrics, optimize your SEO, test your Google analytics, and take action to remedy what’s not working.\nRemember, economic uncertainty doesn’t mean you have to shake in your boots. A smart company can emerge from hard times as a truly great company.\nHear what Latané Conant (CMO at 6Sense) and Amanda Malko (CMO at G2) have to say about\nRecession-Proof Marketing: Innovating How Marketers Work While Building Trust With Buyers\nUp-level your webinars and streamline your marketing campaigns with\nWelcome\n.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/b2b-marketing-during-a-recession\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

If you’re reading this, you probably use an older tool like On24. While they are undoubtedly pioneers in the space, several On24 alternatives are worth exploring. This article will look specifically at other players in the interactive webinar space. Note that we are not going to be looking at video conferencing software. We will specifically evaluate tools that are purpose-made for interactive one-to-many webinars.\nCVENT\nWhile it started as an event management platform,\nCVENT\nquickly pivoted during the beginning of the pandemic and went all-in on virtual. Event organizers know CVENT as one of the pioneers of event management software. If you need a highly customizable event management solution that spans in-person, hybrid, and virtual events, CVENT is worth a look. They also integrate with CRMs and marketing automation platforms like Salesforce, Adobe Marketo, and Hubspot.\nIf On24 is known for its webinar software, CVENT’s sweet spot is trade shows. With features like real-time attendee tracking, ticketing, and event planning tools, many large industry trade shows run on CVENT. It is incredibly scalable if you’re looking to host something more complex than On24 can handle.\nHopin\nA fast-growing virtual event platform,\nHopin\nexploded during the early days of the pandemic. They pioneered a lot of functionality that eventually became standard for virtual events, such as virtual expo booths and cloud-based deployment. They now have a suite of products, such as Sessions for webinars and StreamYard for video production. However, they are still optimized mainly for virtual events. They are slowly adding support for hybrid events through some of their acquisitions, but they aren’t as complete of a solution as CVENT.\nIf you want to host a complex event and optimize for the virtual experience, Hopin can be a good choice. One downside is that they charge per attendee, which makes the pricing slightly higher than On24. They also don’t have as many event marketing features as CVENT. However, it's hard to go wrong with Hopin if you’re looking to host solid event experiences.\nWelcome\nLike On24,\nWelcome\nfocuses on being a great webinar platform. It’s known primarily for its\nengagement features\nand ease of use. Welcome can help you create a higher-caliber event with fewer people. Some\nbuilt-in content creation\nand engagement tools can also help you get more mileage from each event. One of the critical features of Welcome that makes it stand out is its support for on-demand content. With a built-in content generator that can create video clips and other evergreen content, Welcome is bridging the gap between a live webcast and a content generator.  See\nhere\nfor a more detailed comparison between Welcome and On24.\nZoom Webinar\nIf you already use Zoom for videoconferencing, their webinar product is an easy upgrade. Unlike Zoom, their webinar product is designed primarily as an online events platform and specializes in one-to-many broadcasts. While Zoom Webinar (and their associated events product) isn’t as complete of a virtual and hybrid event platform as some of the others here, it’s straightforward for attendees to use since most of them should already have Zoom.\nHonorable mentions\nThere are a lot of other On24 alternatives we don’t have time to get to in-depth.\nBizzabo\nis similar to CVENT, an event management platform turned virtual event platform. BrightTALK is known for being a content repository for on-demand webinars but is starting to develop its live-streaming capability.\nCisco Webex\nalso has a webinar platform that is similar to Zoom Webinar.\nGotoWebinar\nis also an established player in the space worth examining. Finally,\nLivestorm\nis a new player in the area that bears some similarities to Hopin and Welcome.\n‍\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/best-alternatives-to-on24\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n5 B2B Marketing Growths Hacks To Try\nRead"}

They have a complex buying process, long sales cycles, and hard-to-reach decision-makers. Direct marketing offers B2B marketers a way to overcome these challenges and effectively reach their target audience.\nThis article will examine popular direct marketing channels available and why they are still relevant today.\nDirect Mail Campaigns\nDirect mail campaigns are one of the oldest forms of direct marketing, but they remain an effective way to reach decision-makers and generate leads. Mailers can be a creative way to promote brand awareness, drive response rates, and ultimately generate conversions in the offline world.\nB2B direct mail marketing campaigns are often neglected because people think that mail is archaic. But the novelty of direct mail is what makes it effective. Conversion rates can be exceptionally high, especially when paired with account-based marketing. For example, Brex sent champagne bottles to prospects at launch. These types of high-value items can be effective. However, it means that you can’t boil the ocean with direct mail. We recommend sending thoughtful, high-quality items to a select few prospects (for example: C-Suite only).\nEmail Marketing\nEmail marketing is one of the most cost-effective marketing tactics. The key to successful email marketing is to grow your email list constantly. The only way to do that is to provide value consistently and not bombard your prospects too much.\nIn addition to being cost-effective, email marketing also offers a high level of measurable metrics, making it easier to track the success of a campaign and adjust strategies as needed. Marketing automation tools like Hubspot or Salesforce have these features built in. You can also use a service like MailChimp if you don’t need a full-on CRM.\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops! Something went wrong.\nSocial Media\nSocial media is a highly effective channel for direct marketing. Platforms like LinkedIn offer a wealth of information about target accounts and decision-makers, making it easier to craft highly targeted marketing messages. ABM campaigns on LinkedIn can be very effective. It’s much easier to find someone’s LinkedIn profile than their phone number, which makes it more likely that your outreach will be effective.\nOne common mistake with social media is to ask for the close too quickly. Take advantage of the social aspect to build relationships with customers. Instead of making direct asks, comment and like their posts first. Eventually, when you do ask, it will be a warm relationship.\nWebinars\nWebinars work hand-in-hand with email and social media marketing strategies. Inviting customers to a webinar can be a lower-friction call to action than filling out a demo request. Webinars are also excellent sources of leads for your sales team because webinar registrants are typically high-intent buyers.\nInterested in learning more about hosting webinars to generate leads? Check out\nWhy Webinars Are the #1 Lead Generation Marketing Strategy, You May Not Be Thinking About\n.\nOne of the best reasons to run webinars is that it’s a great way for prospects to interact with your company live. While the other direct marketing channels on this list are very short touch points, a webinar attendee can spend hours interacting with you and your brand. After the webinar, your sales team can follow up and schedule a discovery call.\nLearn\nHow to Drive Qualified Pipeline and Enable Sales After Your Webinar Wraps\nPhone Calls\nPhone calls are often overlooked in the world of digital marketing, but they can be a highly effective way to reach decision-makers and generate leads. A well-executed phone call can help to build rapport with a prospect, provide valuable information about a product or service, and ultimately generate a sale.\nIn addition, phone calls offer a high level of accountability and personalization, making it easier to track the success of a campaign and adjust strategies as needed.\nWhy Direct Marketing Channels are Still Relevant Today\nWhile inbound marketing has become a popular way to reach prospects and generate leads, direct marketing channels still play a crucial role in the overall success of B2B marketing campaigns. Direct marketing can be a much more targeted way to reach buyers. If inbound marketing is like using a shotgun, direct marketing is more akin to a sniper rifle. Used correctly, it can generate highly qualified leads for your sales team.\n‍\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/5-direct-marketing-strategies-for-b2b-companies\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

The chat box was fire, your Live Q&A was\nactually\nfun and lively, and you’re ready to review event analytics with your team.\nIf the aim of your webinar was to drive sales, what should you do next? (Aside from crossing your fingers and refreshing the requests for product demos?)\nBelow, we share some best practices for driving qualified leads to take action during your webinar and setting your sales team up for success.\n1. Inspire Attendees to Act\n‍\n‍\nAll the work to drive qualified leads to your sales team technically starts while you’re\ncreating your webinar content\n. As an attribution point in your buyer’s journey, your webinar helps move prospects through the sales funnel. Make this process even easier by adding inspiring call-to-actions, or CTAs, to the final slides for your virtual event.\nA strong CTA will:\nCreate a sense of scarcity (like a limited-time offer or a two-for-one deal),\nor\nProvide your webinar attendees with something they\nreally\nwant (like your one-of-a-kind spreadsheet template or a product demo that makes their purchasing decision that much easier)\nAnd a great CTA might achieve both goals!\nThankfully, new\nwebinar platforms\nmake it easier than ever to create a CTA that drives and captures results. With a clickable CTA overlay, for example, you can capture a lead’s information and funnel it directly to your sales team from within your webinar.\nThis way, you won’t force your lead to fill out yet another form (annoying!) or leave the presentation altogether (a missed opportunity). In just one click, attendees move closer to scheduling that product demo or sales call while your sales team captures all the information they need to make the next touchpoint a success.\nIn addition to promoting product demos, you can also use clickable CTAs to highlight a product guide or promote your next webinar. What’s the ideal next step your prospect should take on your site or with your brand? Promote a link to your best offerings, so they can continue on the buyer’s journey.\n2. Conduct a Post-Event Survey—Before Attendees Leave the Room\nDoes your sales team need more information to drive their post-webinar campaign strategy? Collaborate on a post-event survey to learn even more about your prospects while you still have their attention.\nFollow-up surveys are a great opportunity to discover whether your leads are ready to buy—or are just kicking the tires. Often you won’t know where you stand unless you ask prospects directly about their intent.\nIn\nWelcome\n’s webinar platform, launching a user survey with our\nPolling Feature\nis easy. You can even schedule the survey to drop before the host closes the doors to your event. Not only will attendee responses be more insightful, you’ll also get a better response rate. That means more actionable data for you and your sales team.\n‍\nDon’t risk attendees skipping over an email in their inbox one week later. Pose your most important questions as attendees head out the door, then integrate your survey responses into your customer relationship management (CRM) software to make demo and sales calls that much easier.\nPlanning a webinar? Check out the\nWebinar Best Practices Guide\nto ensure your webinar program is a success!\n3. Follow Up\nAccording to\nConvertKit\n,\n40%\nof webinar registrants will attend your live event. Of your entire registration list, only about\n30% of your audience\nwill watch the webinar content after the actual event ends. That makes following up with registrants even more important for your sales pipeline!\nIn addition to sending your thank you email and event recording after the webinar ends, you should also send along marketing materials or other assets to help attendees make a decision. Since prospects are\n60x more likely to convert\nif you send marketing materials after your webinar, those post-webinar assets are key to sales enablement.\nWhether you’re emailing attendees templates, checklists, or a full breakdown of product features, make sure your sales team knows which assets you’ve chosen—and who’s accessing the files. That way, your sales team will have an easy conversation starter with any leads during their post-webinar sales calls or product demos.\n4. Use CRM Integrations to Maximize Sales Conversations\nWebinars are a popular lead generation tool because they’re highly effective at converting leads into customers. According to\nBrightTALK\n,\n62%\nof webinar attendees request a sales demo after the presentation. Wouldn’t it be great if your sales team already knew everything about the lead—including their webinar engagement?\nThe\nbest webinar platforms\nhave integrations with your CRM, so your sales team can hit the ground running. Capture the actions your webinar attendees take during the event, including any questions they asked during your Live Q&A, any polls they responded to, or any assets they downloaded to read later.\nWith all of this information at your sales team’s fingertips, they won’t be starting a sales call from scratch. Instead, they’ll be able to pick up a conversation right where your lead left off.\n5. Promote Your Webinar Recording with Short-Form Content\nYou already know that\n30% of your webinar registration list\nwill watch event content later. To drive more viewers to the event you worked so hard to produce, use your social channels to promote your webinar—even after it’s over.\nAt\nWelcome\n, we’ve had great success in sharing short-form content from our virtual events on LinkedIn and other social media channels.

If you’ve integrated your webinar platform with your CRM, you should have incredible insights into what your leads are interested in.

For\nB2B\ndemand generation marketing, your target account is a company rather than an individual.\nThere are four major categories of potential buyers for a B2B demand gen strategy.\nProducers\ncreate new products/services from a combination of other products/services (think Georgia-Pacific, Asus, United Airlines)\nResellers\ntake an existing product and sell it to consumers\nGovernments\nare some of the world’s biggest buyers\nInstitutions\ninclude nonprofits and charities (think Harvard, and Catholic Charities U.S.A.)\nBusinesses tend to have larger sales volumes, with a higher potential for expansion and up-sells. A demand-generation strategy for businesses requires careful research and planning in order to be successful and result in high-quality leads for sales teams.\nB2B buyers are not a uniform creature. Before starting a demand generation campaign, your marketing efforts need to be aligned with the\npain points\nyou are solving for each buyer category. It is important to identify the\ndifferent decision makers\ninvolved in the various types of businesses, and where in the sales funnel your marketing campaign will be a touchpoint on their buyer journey. The type of content that appeals to Contracting Officers and Acquisition Staff for the DoD will certainly be different from something that will capture the attention of Playtex’s Director of Purchasing, for example.\nB2B Demand Generation Strategy\nA\ndata-driven content strategy\nwill take into account the multiple and varying factors driving new customers and conversion rates. Generating demand for MQLs is the result of generation efforts based on data, not thoughts and prayers ;) For B2B marketing especially, it is critical to measure the metrics of your marketing strategy across multiple channels.\nYour marketing team has to align with your sales team\nand create marketing tactics for\nconsistent messaging\nacross account-based marketing, content marketing, social media, and anywhere else outreach to potential customers has\nproven successful\n. Building awareness from your demand generation programs will facilitate the sales process with higher lead quality.\nIn 2023, B2B demand generation marketing relies more than ever on digital marketing strategies.\nShort-form video\nfrom webinars is one of the hottest trends for B2B marketing, transferring the split-second appeal of TikTok into quick relevant content that grabs paying customers in the B2B field at the top of the funnel.\nContent creation\nand\nmarketing automation\ntools are exploding right now, making it easier than ever to optimize your B2B demand generation strategy with less effort and lower CAC (customer acquisition cost).\nCreating demand and brand awareness are obvious goals for a successful B2B demand generation strategy. One oft-forgot but\ncritical goldmine\nof opportunity, however, lies in existing customers. B2B demand generation marketing is not just about grabbing new customers - it’s also about\ngenerating demand from your already-paying customers\n. They already love and trust you! So who better than your existing customer base, to hear about more new products and areas where your product can help them solve even more pain points? Not to mention that they are a prime source for referrals - invaluable for high-quality lead generation.\nRead more\nabout demand-gen and hosting webinars that captivate and convert.\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops!

There is no one-size-fits-all recommendation when it comes to building a strong marketing team, but some basic tenets should be taken into consideration.\nThe two most common types of marketing are B2B (business-to-business) and B2C (business-to-consumer). For the purposes of this article we will focus on marketing team structure for B2B companies.\nB2B Marketing Teams\nB2B marketing teams will typically sell to several main types of businesses: Producers, Resellers, Governments and Institutions. These target markets in turn will fall into categories by size. An SMB (small business) will typically employ 5-100 people. A mid-size business will typically employ 101-1,000 people. An Enterprise business will typically employ 1,000 or more people.\nEach type of business requires its own type of marketing campaign, with customized marketing functions, for a high ROI. Your marketing team should be determined by your own company size, marketing budget, and your target market. Key marketing initiatives should be built around these considerations.\nDoing the preliminary research for a B2B marketing campaign may fall on the shoulders of one person in a small company; a larger company with a bigger marketing budget could employ several different people just to figure out where to begin. In 2023, with everyone focusing on economizing marketing efforts, each marketing role tends to lean hard on maximum optimization no matter the team size.\nOrganizational structure for a B2B marketing team\nOrganizational structure for a B2B marketing team can be fluid. Org charts can be arbitrary but any marketing team should begin with someone acting as the\nChief Marketing Officer\n(CMO). (Note that titles in B2B marketing are not immutable. There are dozens of titles that mean the same thing - the key is to look at what function a role plays, and what skill sets are required, rather than the title.) A CMO might also be referred to as Head of Marketing or Director of Marketing. This person is ultimately at the top of the B2B marketing team, and determines the high-level strategy. They will act as a master strategist to create a workflow for all the other marketing leaders in a well-defined overall marketing strategy.\nKey levels of organization under the CMO will revolve around Product, Growth, Design and Content. In smaller companies, many of these roles may overlap and be handled by one person rather than a team of people.\nThe\nProduct Marketing Team\nwill focus efforts around clearly defining the product being marketed, who should use it and how to use it, and the value it has for the target audience. The Product Marketing Team will work very closely with developers and sales teams to ensure a successful product launch.\nThe\nDesign Marketing Team\nwill create visual assets that align a product’s function and company’s marketing message across platforms. Marketing Design Teams will consider where product placements are being made, and create graphics that work best to portray the product in its most appealing format. Graphic design is a key function for the design marketing team. The Design Team will also ensure visual messaging presents consistent brand awareness. A web designer is especially important for a Design Marketing Team, as they will create the landing page that acts as the face of your business online.\nThe\nContent Marketing Team\nis not just about writing well. Content marketing is not like journaling or writing a novel. Strong content creation relies heavily on data analytics from search engine optimization and social media marketing performance. A strong copywriter on the content team will not just write appealing material, but material that performs for lead generation across social media and search. B2B content marketing also includes copywriting for email-marketing campaigns.\nThe\nGrowth Marketing Team\nwill study the metrics for KPIs and work to increase engagement in already successful arenas, while finding new areas for product awareness and expansion. They will also work with product developers to continually build out product functions, then promote them to create new opportunities both within the existing customer base and for new users.\nGiven the economic concerns in 2023, many B2B companies are outsourcing freelancers for their marketing role hires. Whether a marketing team is composed of full-time in-house marketing employees or contractors, it is critical for all team members in a marketing department to understand their mission, metrics and action items. Stellar project management can pull together a small team on a budget for a successful outcome. Conversely, a hugely bloated marketing team in a Fortune 500 company with a million-dollar budget can accomplish very little if they have a poorly thought-out marketing strategy.\nMarketers have an opportunity to become strong stewards of the brand. Along with investing into your brand, investing into your people actually synergistically goes hand-in-hand. Your team members are the nucleus of your brand in everything they say, do, build, and serve for your prospects & customers.\nView this conversation\nwith Kevan Lee, SVP of Marketing at\nOyster\n, as he shares his story, insights, and frameworks on building iconic brands that start with building phenomenal teams.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/4-common-types-of-b2b-marketing-team-structures-used-in-2023\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n5 B2B Marketing Growths Hacks To Try\nRead"}

Companies are now utilizing the technology to its full potential to reach a global audience and engagingly deliver information.\nIf you've been working remotely for a while, you've discovered that staying alert and engaged the whole time is challenging. Marketers swear by webinars, and as more companies clamor to host them, people have become inundated with invitations to attend.\nSo, how do you make your virtual event stand out? Here's a list of webinar engagement ideas to help increase attendee participation and leave your audience with a lasting impression.\nZooming out of Zoom\nWhile Zoom has undoubtedly been a game-changer, especially during the pandemic, many people are now experiencing\nZoom fatigue\n. Staring at the same screen for hours upon hours for work, classes, talking with friends and family, and even therapy sessions have taken a mental toll on most people.\nConcentrating is increasingly tricky when our brains rely only on verbal information. It's very similar to how you'd listen to your teacher drone on in class in the background while your mind is elsewhere. In this case, it's even worse because no one will call you out for it.\nTo combat the fatigue many are feeling, it's crucial to rethink the whole interface of webinars with more interactivity.\nStart the webinar strong\nYour goal should be to create an anticipatory and fun atmosphere for your event, so you'll want to pump up your audience from the very start. Think of the beginning of the webinar as the previews that come before the movie at the theatre. This is where you pull all the stops. You can start the session with virtual games, which warm the participants up to actively engage throughout the session. You can also share pre-recorded hype videos or do virtual pub quizzes on the event's topic to get things started.\nChoose speakers with stage presence\nYour speaker will make or break the virtual event. It would be best if you had someone with charisma, energy, and confidence to capture and command the participants' attention. Yes, you have a thought leader, an influential person in your industry, but can they passionately convey valuable insights through the camera?\nMany industry leaders and experts could be well-versed in the topic. Still, your event will only stay energized if they can authentically communicate. Your audience can tell when there's an authentic connection, often through the speaker's tone, body language, gestures, and facial expressions.\nPeople don't just want to hear information about the speaker's knowledge and expertise; it would also be helpful to include tidbits about their personal journey. This helps to create an emotional connection and a synergy between the audience and the speaker.\nIf you have multiple speakers for an event, it's crucial to coordinate rehearsals and ensure harmony. Your speakers should interact comfortably with other participants, so the audience is not kept out of the loop.\nGo beyond the slide deck\nWhile slide decks have been a great way to introduce the visual component during presentations, there might be better ways to go for a virtual event. We're all familiar with the awkward moment as a speaker struggles to get their screenshare working so they can share a PowerPoint presentation.\nYou can go the other, more effective way, using\nbranded graphics\nto aid your presentation. Custom overlays, for one, will revolutionize your presentation. With overlays, rather than the attendees shifting their attention to reading slides, the speaker gets to present the content on screen alongside the audience. Overlays also help keep the content minimal so the focus remains solely on the speaker.\nThe bulk of the content should be presented through speech. Sometimes people get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information when the presenter overloads the slides, or they read them fast and zone out before the presenter gets to the main points.\nStage Kit\ngives you the tools and the power to create professional quality virtual events. Moreover, you get multiple engagement features built directly into the platform. You don't have to be an experienced designer to create beautiful on-brand virtual events. Anyone on your team can easily put together the branded assets on the platform.\n‍\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops! Something went wrong.\nBring attendees on stage for Q&A\nQ&A sessions make the event more interactive and more personal for the attendees. When they know that the presenter genuinely cares about what they take away from the event, they're more likely to be more engaged and more interactive.\nStandard webinar Q&As usually consist of webinar hosts answering audience questions in a one-directional manner. This is different from having an interactive Q&A session. Interactive Q&As are built into the event to help facilitate a bi-directional dialogue. Meaning you can invite an audience member on stage to ask their question face-to-face.\nInteractive Q&A is a lot better for your webinar. For one, the attendees won't feel like they're being talked at, as is often the case with virtual events. The presenter has all the information, while the participants passively consume what they say.\nWith interactive Q&A, the participants' input is valued and structured like an in-person question-and-answer exchange. As the event progresses, audience questions can be upvoted so the speaker addresses the most burning questions first.\nPlanning a webinar? Check out the\nWebinar Best Practices Guide\nto ensure your webinar program is a success!\nSwitch up the format\nOne of the major reasons webinars have become boring is we know what to expect. Most webinars feel dull because it's just 45 or 60 minutes of the speaker going on and on. Often, people find themselves distracted by social media or even shopping online while the meeting continues.\nRemember, distractions are only a click away, so what will hold your audience's attention?\nIncluding various formats is the best way to maximize attention and engagement. Don't just stick to speech and slides. Switch up the event's structure by interjecting a short video or two, polls, and bringing attendees on stage to ask questions.\nYou can also split the audience into breakout rooms where they'll engage in smaller group discussions. This can be a great way to get feedback from the audience to determine whether the event objectives are being met. As a best practice, avoid speaking for longer than 15 minutes without changing the format slightly.\nDeliver value\nPeople attend webinars to learn something useful.\n70% of B2B professionals\nwant to sharpen their skills with the latest tips, tricks, and best practices. Delivering value should be the first goal when preparing for your virtual event. Keeping your audience engaged is much easier when they find value in the information provided.\nPolls, videos, and virtual games are great, but the content is at the core of your event. What is the message you're trying to get across? Soft-selling is key. The consumer today is well-informed and wary of overt marketing tactics.\nAs such, the goal of your webinar should be to showcase how your product or service is the best solution to a problem they're facing around the webinar topic. Don't make the webinar all about your products and services, as your audience can see through it.\nProvide the audience with free resources throughout the webinar to help them further understand the webinar topic. This way, you position yourself as a thought leader, and they'll turn to you whenever they encounter problems that can be fixed with your product or service.\nMeasure engagement afterwards\nLike any other marketing tactic, you have to measure the return on investment of your events. This should be a continuous process of improvement that will drive growth for your brand. The conversations don't stop after the event is over. For further engagement, utilize the testimonials, top questions and their answers, and presentation summaries.\nTo measure engagement, you'll need accurate, timely analytics. With\nWelcome's Analytics at a Glance Dashboard\n, you can quickly gauge the actual level of engagement in your virtual events. The audience engagement and other essential data insights are visualized for you in an Event Report Card so you can highlight areas that need improvement.\nWe are a webinar platform dedicated to helping you host the best virtual even experiences that will drive revenue. Our tools and features are designed with engagement in mind to help you connect with your audience at every level.

Moreover, the trends of live streaming and video sharing opportunities are also adding to the expansion.\nWebinars and virtual events are now one of marketers' top lead-generating tactics. In fact,\n53% of marketers\nsay webinars are the top-of-the-funnel content format that generates the most high-quality leads.\nSo with webinars being such an essential part of the B2B marketing strategy, it's important to know standard metrics and statistics from which to measure your webinar success.\nWhat Are The Most Popular Webinar Topics?\n70% of B2B professionals\nseek tips, tricks, and best practices. Webinars are educational, so most B2B professionals attending them look for professional advice and best practices.\nHolding webinars on popular topics allow your audience to keep up with emerging trends and webinar best practices. Some popular webinar topics are post-pandemic management, career advancement, mental health, self-care, skills improvement, and business development.\nWhile choosing your webinar, focus on what will help your audience. Don't forget to add educational value to your webinar, as your audience won't like an hour-long sales pitch.\nOther\nwebinar content that people desire\nis industry trends and predictions (62%), how-to's/explanations (61%), expert interviews (60%), case studies (59%), or data insights and original research (55%).\nWebinar Registration and Attendance Benchmarks\nThe following registration and attendance webinar benchmarks will help you evaluate what kind of response you are getting from your audience and make timely improvements.\nMore People Register On The Same Day of The Webinar\n29% of people register\nfor webinars on the same day they are taking place, and only 15% register 15 days or more before the event.\nHowever, the standard practice is to promote your webinar two weeks before show time. Don't procrastinate. Promote your webinar and increase the promotion a week before the event. Post on social media, increase your organic and paid traffic with SEO, and send emails to recipients.\nFor those who haven't registered, send a last chance email encouraging them to sign up. Also, send one more reminder email on the webinar day.\nRegistration Conversion Rate is Lower for Cold Traffic\nThe average\nwebinar registration page conversion rate is 30% for cold traffic\n. With new visitors, you'll see less conversion on your registration pages as they will take time to trust your business.\nEmail is the Top Promotional Channel for Webinars\nUp to\n57% of registrations come from email marketing\n. While building a promotional strategy for your webinars, email campaigns must be a part of it.\nEmail marketing is unpaid promotion. Secondly, it also effectively drives more registrations. Improve your email marketing campaign results by dividing your email list into segments and sending personalized messages instead of generic invites.\nYour audience will more likely open your emails if you have a personalized subject line rather than a salesy one.\nIn addition, you can increase your email outreach by teaming up with a B2B marketing influencer or other companies to leverage their email lists.\nRegistrant To Attendee Show-Up Ratio is Around 40%\nOn average,\nWelcome customers have a 66% attendance rate\n. Although 40% is the industry standard attendance rate, but depending on your email marketing, the webinar topic, and any incentives given to attend the event, this number will fluctuate. 40% also includes \"cold traffic\" registration numbers, meaning people who have never interacted with your website. This tends to lower the attendance rate, so keep in mind that you can expect even higher numbers if you only target high-quality, warm leads.\n‍\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops! Something went wrong.\n‍\nWebinar Production Benchmarks\nThe Best Day To Host a Webinar Is Thursday\n26% of viewers prefer to join webinars on Thursday\n, followed by Tuesday (23%) and Wednesday (21%).\nThere is no one-size-fits-all approach to holding a webinar because the best time and day will vary based on your audience. But mid-week sounds more appropriate as, based on research, that's when your audience is more likely to attend your webinar.\nThursday produces the highest attendance, with Tuesday and Wednesday following behind. Most professionals are busy on Mondays and Fridays due to last-minute tasks and catch-up meetings, so these days are not a good option for hosting your event. However, these facts are benchmarks and should only be used as an initial guide. Experiment with different times and days. Invite feedback from the audience to find which day is best for them. This will help create the best schedule for your unique audience.\nMore People Prefer To Attend Webinars Mid-Morning\n28% of people prefer to join webinars mid-morning\n, 27% mid-afternoon.\nMid-morning and mid-afternoon are the best times when your audience is more likely to attend your webinar. 11 am gets the highest attendance rate, with 2 pm coming at second-highest and 1 pm taking third place.\nThis suggests that midday seems an excellent option to host a webinar with 12 pm as an exception. Usually, people take lunch at noon, so attendance is low at that time.\nAttendees Spend Only 50 Minutes In a Webinar\nOn average,\nattendees stick around for 50 minutes in a webinar\n.\nThe attendee stick rate is the average time your audience spends in your webinar. Although there are exceptions to the average stick time, like most webinars, you must also keep your event to around 45 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes.\nYou can also run longer events. But your audience's attention span will be less by the time you deliver your sales speech. So if that is the case, better stick to the 45 minutes rule.\nMore Attendees Want a live Q&A Session\n67% of attendees want a live Q&A with speakers\n.\nA webinar is an excellent tool for engaging your audience. But research shows that attendees are more interested in live Q & A sessions with the speakers than in polls and handouts.\nTherefore, provide opportunities for your audience to type in questions and comments on their devices in real-time while your speech is underway. Or you can hold a live Q&A session in your webinar to provide a fun way of interacting with your prospects.\nReal-time feedback will help you understand what resonates well with your audience. It will also help you immediately address the pre-sale objections that your audience might have.\nPlanning a webinar? Check out the\nWebinar Best Practices Guide\nto ensure your webinar program is a success!\nPost-Webinar Benchmarks\nIncreased Conversion Rate With Post-Webinar Marketing\nProspects are\n60x more likely to convert\nif a webinar includes marketing materials afterward.\nYour job doesn't end after wrapping up a webinar. Within an hour of your live webinar, if you provide your prospects with marketing material, they will more likely convert to your customers.\nWith your webinar signups, you already have a high number of qualified leads on your email list. So you can use the list to send a follow-up email to your registrants. Besides, other marketing material could be an eBook, exclusive offers, or free strategy sessions.\n‍\nHigher Percentage of Attendees Request A Demo Post-Webinar\n62% of webinar attendees request a demo from sales\n.\nWe've already established that webinars are perfect for gathering qualified leads. But when most attendees request free demos, you must be fully equipped to run a successful digital demo program.\nDemos will allow you to show your products in real-time, enticing buyers and increasing lead conversion. You can alert your sales team about prospects' activity while running virtual demos after your webinar. Demos will also help you to analyze, qualify and forward prospects to correct nurturing programs.\n‍\nConclusion\nWebinar benchmarks\nhelp set goals and measure success based on webinar metrics such as attendance, registration rate, engagement, and CTA clicks.\nWelcome is one of the best webinar platforms, specifically built for B2B marketers to host webinars guaranteed to engage your audience and generate revenue.

There are a variety of reasons to do so. Maybe you want to create top-of-funnel awareness for your product. Perhaps you want to bring prospects deeper into your sales funnel. Maybe you want to share expert secrets with your customers. At the end of the day, hosting a webinar is a great way to connect with your audience. To ensure a successful webinar, a script is absolutely essential to making sure that you stay on track. In this blog post, we will be discussing the perfect webinar script, pioneered by Russell Brunson (creator of ClickFunnels and DotCom Secrets) in his classic “The Perfect Webinar Secrets” book. In this book, he helps digital marketers, business owners and bloggers run their very own webinars. This book is focused on creating the perfect webinar funnel.\nThese are:\nIntro/Building Rapport\nThe One Thing\nThe Three Secrets\nThe Stack\nWe will go into each one of those step-by-step and provide concrete examples of how we’ve done this at\nWelcome\n. Consider this a template you can use as a starting place.\nIntro / Building Rapport\nThe perfect webinar template starts with creating a good impression. Think about the experience that an attendee will have as soon as they enter your webinar. Too many webinars these days feel like glorified Zoom calls. Spice up your webinar introduction with music, pre-recorded videos, and effects. Tools like Welcome’s\nstudio\ncan make your webinar feel like a Hollywood production with very little effort. You want to build a sense of anticipation at the start of your webinar so that attendees can’t wait for the show to start. One way to do this is to ask engaging questions in chat. Questions such as “where are you from?” or “What’s your favorite restaurant in your home city” can create a sense of engagement before the live webinar even starts. Russell Brunson’s Perfect Webinar calls this\nbuilding rapport\n.\nThe One Thing\nAs many entrepreneurs will tell you, the key to success is focus. Your webinar should have a singular theme and call to action. Pick a webinar topic that is relevant to your buyer. As soon as you start the webinar, it should be clear what that is. The best webinars use this to create a hook, that will be explored in-depth later. Think of what prompted your attendees to sign up for this webinar. This will largely depend on your target audience. Our webinars tend to target demand-gen marketers, so our topics center around things like conversion rates and upsells. For affiliate marketers, this may not be very relevant. The most important thing is to make sure that it’s attention-grabbing and relevant. One recent\nwebinar\nwe did talked about “Recession-Proof Marketing”.\nConsider using webinar slides to help you stay on track. Most webinar software these days will support Powerpoint, Keynote, or Google Slides. If you want to get really fancy, you can create overlay slides using a tool like\nWelcome\n. One common mistake to avoid is too many bullet points. You should ideally have at most 3-5 bullet points per slide. Try your best to make sure the content is unique and insightful. You don’t want to regurgitate things that your audience has already heard. Case studies are a great way to make your content unique since no two businesses will have the exact same case study.\n‍\nThe Stack and Close\nThe concept of the stack is best illustrated by the idea of “stacking value”. The stack slide is important before moving to the close. The reason is, it’s one place where you quantify the value of your product or service. Webinar attendees have short attention spans, so you need to remind them of all of the value they are getting before getting to the call to action. This is a similar concept used in SEO, where you want to stuff all of the relevant keywords into your article. Likewise, you want to stuff all of the relevant points in your webinar into a single slide.\nEffectiveness\nWhile there is no perfect webinar structure, Russell Brunson’s book is a good start. It’s very focused on bottom-of-funnel marketing, so some concepts like the stack won’t be appropriate for everyone. However, as social media testimonials can attest, it’s very effective when used properly.

What’s the point of a great virtual event if no one is interested, though?  Your webinar title is your front line and it has to grab attention\nimmediately to be effective. Here are 5 great tips to capture your audience and increase conversion and click-through rates, using just your webinar title!\nYour webinar title needs to be\nshort and to the point\nto capture your target audience’s attention. The title of your webinar should be between 50 to 70 characters. Make sure each word is relevant to your audience. A long webinar title will not only bore your target, but the algorithm can also cut you off in search engines and social media.\nPractice,\npractice\n, practice! Test your webinar title. Brainstorm a few different webinar titles on the same platform, and see which one performs better - use your most catchy webinar title for higher conversion rates on your landing page and increased webinar registration numbers.\nThink about the environment - no, not the Greta Thunberg one (although everyone should think about that) - here, we are talking about the environment surrounding your webinar title. Is your webinar topic related to something\ntimely\nthat’s happening in the world right now? This isn’t something you should force if nothing is relevant, but if there is a\ntrending event\nthat works with your webinar title, use it!\nBefore you set your webinar and its title, think about your topic first. Make sure you have\nproduct-market fit\n. If your target audience doesn’t want or need it, you may want to go back to the lab for some tinkering. Online events are a dime a dozen now, so your content marketing should address a concrete need or pain point.\nLast but definitely not least, make your\ntarget audience\nthink - a great webinar title backed by relevant webinar content, will create an exclamation point or question mark in\nthe head of your target audience\n.\nUse these\nWebinar Best Practices\nin your next webinar to create beautiful, successful webinars that captivate and convert.

Plus, they're still the preferred way for marketers to learn. According to the\nContent Marketing Institute\n, 75% of B2B marketers attend webinars—and that figure isn't changing any time soon.\nUnfortunately, most webinars\ndon't\nperform well with their audiences. On average, only about\n40% of your registrants\nwill show up live—and only\n15% will convert\n. That doesn't give you much wiggle room!\nUse our webinar planning and strategy best practices to capture your audience's attention—and hook them from the moment you step on the virtual stage. Here's everything you need to know about planning your webinar, from developing awesome content to driving engagement during the event itself. Let's dive in!\n8 Weeks Out: Planning Your Webinar Content\nTwo months from your ideal launch date is the best time to kick off your content planning and strategy sesh. Follow these tips for developing content that converts!\nKnow Your Audience\nTo develop great webinar content, you have to understand your audience's pain points. What are they hungry to learn? What problems are they trying to solve?\nNot sure? Conduct small-scale targeted research through polls and surveys by putting your email lists and social channels to good use. (Pro tip: Try LinkedIn's\npolling feature\nto gauge your audience's interests quickly.) You can even narrow down your inquiries with event registrants—or ask your audience about a finer point live during the event!\nIf people think you can help them solve their problem, they are often happy to share—especially if responding means a more tailored, engaged, or personalized event experience.\nWhat are you waiting for? Get researching!\nPlanning a webinar?

Sometimes relevance and depth are better than an instantly recognizable name—especially if you have a topic bound to draw in registrants. (Remember the importance of credibility?)\nOnce you invite your speaker, work together to discuss pain points and narrow in on a topic that will wow your audience.\nChoose a Topic That Resonates\nAccording to\nSearch Engine Journal\n, 70% of B2B professionals are searching for tips, tricks, and best practices. What can you and your speaker share with other professionals who\nreally\nwant to solve their most pressing problems?\nWorking from a broad topic to a narrow, audience-centered hook is often helpful. For instance, you might start with \"Webinar Best Practices\" and narrow it down to \"Double Your Webinar Conversion Rate!\" That is, as long as you've got the goods. ;)\nTypical broad topics include:\nHow to solve common problems\nInsider industry know-how\nHow to learn a specific skill or understand a relevant new trend\nProduct deep dives\nWhich approach works best for your audience? How can you tailor the topic to be even more relevant to their needs or challenges?\nDevelop Supporting Content\nThe best webinars have a host of supporting content. This content should be designed to engage your audience during and after the webinar, from landing pages and downloadable assets to special event or community invitations.\nAlready written about your webinar topic? All the better! Now's the time to optimize your site's content to drive more traffic to your webinar registration page.

You've launched your registration page and created valuable supporting content your audience will love. Now it's time to get your \"Register here!\" button in front of as many people as possible.\nTarget Your Audience\nIt might be tempting to toot your own horn, but webinars are about your audience: what\nthey\nwant to learn and the problems\nthey\nwant to solve. All the copy in your announcements and outreach emails should reflect this to attract the best leads to the event.\nAnd don't forget to target the job titles, companies, or prospects who will most benefit from your content! The more you can personalize these invites with information you already have in your sales database, the better.\nFind the Right Email Cadence\nThere's an art to webinar outreach. And it likely takes more messaging touchpoints in your campaign than you think to convince prospects to attend your event.\nSince nearly\n60%\nof webinar registrations are generated via email campaigns, it's important to get it right. At a minimum, you'll need to send:\nA webinar outreach email\nA registration confirmation email\nAn event reminder (or three)\nA \"Thank you\" message\nA follow-up message with the webinar recording and any other assets you've prepared for attendees\nNow's the time to put all of your thoughtful, hard-working copy to the test. Build anticipation and clarify why your audience can't miss out on your offering!\nTrack Registration Numbers\nYou've launched your email campaign, and the registration numbers are starting to tick up. Awesome!\nAs your campaign progresses, remember to track how you're doing. Are you hitting your registration goals?

Here are the best tips for keeping everyone happy, excited, and engaged during the event.\nSupport Your Speaker\nEnsure your guest speakers are prepped, ready, and comfortable in your\nvirtual green room\n.

Their responses might even inspire your next webinar topic!\nFinally, remember: only about\n56%\nof webinar registrants will attend your event live. You'll need to inspire your on-demand audience members to engage, too. This makes enticing CTAs and supporting webinar content all the more important.\n‍\nAfter Your Webinar: Nurturing Leads\nCongrats! Your webinar was a huge success.

It's your chance to capture interest from anyone who didn't click that CTA button in your live event and transform them into a customer.\nReview Your Analytics\nHow did your event perform? According to the\nContent Marketing Institute\n, there are six key metrics you should analyze after every webinar:\nClick-through ratio\nAttendee ratio\nOnline poll results\nAudience retention\nExit surveys\nOn-demand viewings\nWith the\nright webinar platform\n, you can conduct deep dives into your event's performance to discover when your audience was most engaged, where their attention drifted, and how they felt about your content.\nAnalytics is critical whether you're trying to prove the ROI of conducting a webinar, better understanding your attendees, or looking ahead to the next event.\nWork with Your Sales Team\nYour\nsales team\nhas incredible insights into customer pain points, needs, and challenges.

It generally refers to bootstrapping traditional marketing strategies with innovative, extremely cost-effective methods. Hacking B2B growth marketing involves looking at unusual ways to create brand awareness, acquire new customers and accelerate business growth.\nThe key to B2B growth hacking strategies is first and foremost, a\ndata-driven\nmarketing campaign. Innovative/non-traditional does not mean haphazard and unplanned, nor is it only for startups. In fact, it means exactly the opposite. A smart B2B growth hack comes from a careful study of the target audience (in this case B2B businesses), followed by an ultra-streamlined plan of attack using minimal and low-cost resources. These methods may be in the vein of more traditional marketing tactics like search engine optimization, email marketing and referral marketing - but they can be tweaked for the type of guerilla marketing techniques that growth hacking implements.\nHere are five proven methods for B2B growth hacking:\nHyper-targeting\n(clearly identifying your target customer and delivering extremely relevant messages in key places). For B2B marketing, the most important social media platform is LinkedIn. This is the gathering place for businesses, so targeting potential customers here with the right content marketing plan, can exponentially boost qualified lead generation.\nFreemiums\nget your audience in the door but make sure the free version has stand-alone value that creates\nbrand loyalty\nand the desire to expand usage. A good freemium should quickly build a happy user base willing to be product evangelists for new user referral programs.\nPartnerships\nwith influencers, bloggers and thought-leaders who resonate with your customer base. Successful growth hacking in B2B marketing is not necessarily about avoiding any traditional marketing strategies.\nHosting a webinar\nor podcast with a thought-leader is a traditional marketing tactic, but a growth hacker will take that piece of content and make it work in multiple ways. For example,\nWelcome\nis a\nwebinar platform\nwith a\nbuilt-in content creation studio\n. This means you can add music, videos and useful on-screen overlays to complement your webinar. A\nrecently released feature\nallows you to put on-screen calls to action (CTA) for your attendees. You can also easily create splice-able clips for social sharing.\n“\nBranding over Botting\n” - personalization goes a long way in creating strong brand loyalty for both you and your customer base, especially in a world being overrun by AI content. An easy user interface that allows for customization is especially appealing for B2B marketing. The ability to brand your product with your customer’s logo can be a quick and easy growth hack.\nBuild Integrations\nthat work well with popular platforms that help optimize conversion rates (Hubspot and Salesforce are especially important for B2B integrations).\nWhat works for others can work for you. So don’t be afraid of “copying” the competition - your B2B growth marketing strategy should incorporate historically successful tactics, vetted for your current needs. This means\nstrong data analysis before and after\nyou run your\nB2B marketing campaigns\n. Know exactly where to shoot your shot, then analyze your results and adjust future actions based on this data.\nIf you do this right, your B2B marketing growth hacks could result in an\nexplosion of new customers\n, high-quality leads and new business. Surprisingly, this\ncould be good or bad news\n- if you don’t prepare for the growth, you could end up floundering and disorganized, losing the positive brand awareness you worked hard to create. So make sure you have a plan in place to\nhandle sudden growth\n. New users of your product will expect excellent service/follow-up and a UI that doesn’t break, for example. Your sales team will need relevant assets that can be disseminated quickly as well. Hopefully these will be “problems” for which you have prepared in advance and have to face, after a successful B2B growth marketing hack campaign!\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/5-b2b-marketing-growths-hacks-to-try\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

As new technologies and platforms emerge, so do new trends and strategies for marketing to businesses. Marketers must understand where the industry is heading to stay ahead of the curve. This article will discuss the top B2B marketing trends and strategies for 2023. We'll also provide tips on how you can adapt these trends to fit your own business needs.\nThe Rise of Purpose-Driven Brands\nYounger generations have always lived in an information-rich, globalized world, but what's different now is that they also have a voice. They are the first generation to use their buying power to influence the world around them for good—and they are using it.\nAccording to the Cone/Porter Novelli survey,\n66% of people\nsaid they would switch from a product they always use to one from a purpose-driven company.\nBrand purpose is the practice of aligning a company's values with the needs of the world around them. It's about more than just making money; it's about using business as a force for good. A purpose-driven brand knows its why and communicates it in everything they do, from its advertising to its corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.\nMost brands are starting to include CSR as part of their brand purpose. CSR is the practice of incorporating social and environmental concerns into a company's business operations and decision-making. It's a way for brands to give back to their communities and positively impact the world.\nTo appeal to purpose-driven consumers, brands need to be transparent about their CSR initiatives. Patagonia founder,\nYvon Chouinard\n, set the purpose-driven bar by donating his entire $3 billion company to a trust and non-profit organization.\nAlthough your company doesn't have to take things quite that far, you can still implement CSR and purpose by aligning your brand with an important cause. There are many ways to do this, such as through donations, volunteering, or supporting a local charity.\nForrester's\nB2B 2022 Marketing Survey\nconfirms the purpose-based trend by showing brands planned on aligning purpose with vision, mission, and CSR goals to support high growth in the company.\nBetter Customer Experiences\nYour clients always expect a seamless and personalized experience, no matter the stage of the buyer's journey. That means you shouldn't stop nurturing them once the deal is closed. Customer Experience (CX) has become one of the most significant factors in helping a brand stand apart from its competition. To provide a competitive edge, marketers need to think creatively and use the strengths of all marketing departments in 2023.\nForrester's Priorities Survey\nfrom 2022 explains that cross-selling and upselling are already high priorities for improving the customer experience and will continue to be in 2023.\nTurning a potential lead into a client is the first part of the customer experience. Now that they have become your client, you can further engage them to help retain and grow existing accounts. Here are some ways B2B Marketers are doing this:\nPersonalizing Your Client's Experience.\nDoing so begins with the data you have about them. Make specific customer personas to create valuable and educational content for each customer and use marketing automation to trigger personalized emails based on your customer's behavior.\n‍\nMore self-service options.\nPeople today have significantly shorter attention spans than those in the past, expecting immediate answers to their questions. Customers would instead handle their issues independently than wait for a customer service rep. So make sure to invest in detailed FAQs, resource centers, and customer education webinars to uplevel their knowledge of your product and resolve their issues with as little friction as possible.\n‍\nOffering Online Experiences.\nBrands are rethinking interactive ways to provide\nunique virtual experiences\nadapted to their customers. Think of different ways to delight your top customers. Maybe offer virtual cooking or wine tasting classes, or host a product roadmap webinar, deep dive into the product and give them a chance to voice their needs and ideas for the future.\nCreating advocates for your brand is a trend in 2023 that your brand must commit to. Marketing decision makers plan to increase the budget for customer engagement headcount by 10% or more in 2023.\nGifting is the New Customer Retention Strategy\nAs more of the world moves online, the opportunity to create in-person experiences becomes rarer every year. To accommodate the change, your company must find new ways to connect and retain clients.\nOne way to create an amazing customer experience is through gifting. Businesses can use gifting to show appreciation, build relationships, and create loyalty. Use gifts creatively in a welcome package or included with the first purchase of an item.\nWhen done right, gifting can significantly impact the customer experience. Coresight Research reported that\n35% of respondents\nwere gifting more than usual since remote work.\nLoop & Tie, a\ncorporate gifting platform\n, has created a double opportunity for customer retention by pairing gifting with sustainability. They support craft makers and artisans and donate to land restoration and regenerative agriculture initiatives.\nGifting is also a way to retain employees. Turnover rates have skyrocketed, and The Great Resignation has left many companies understaffed and overworked. The power of a gift to employees can not be understated. The simple act of goodwill can leave a lasting impression on the employee and not only cause them to stay longer, but they will recommend your company to other qualified candidates.\nVirtual Events Are Here to Stay\nWebinars and virtual meetings have been commonplace in the work environment for years. It wasn't until people were forced indoors that virtual events really began to take off, and they show no signs of slowing down in 2023.\nDifferent\nuse cases for virtual events\nhave expanded, and so have the reasons why companies are continuing to use them:\nIncreased accessibility for a global audience\nLower cost of production\nFuture marketing opportunities\nNetworking\nPromotion of a new service or product\nEnvironmentally beneficial\nVirtual events are here to stay, and environmental sustainability is a big added benefit. According to Forrester, two-thirds\nof B2B businesses\nidentify environmental sustainability as a high priority in the next 12 months.\nBy hosting a virtual event, your company can avoid the pollution caused by travel and reduce its carbon footprint. You can also donate to causes that help offset any emissions from the event itself. Lowering the carbon footprint is a key benefit of virtual events for\n36% of B2B marketers\n.\nSo while the temptation to revert to in-person events might be high, virtual events hold more benefits and will remain a crucial channel for marketing into 2023 and beyond.\nReimagining Webinars\nWebinars are another marketing tool that have become widely popularized after the pandemic to engage customers and generate leads. While most webinars have followed a rather mundane template, trends show more\ncreative webinar platforms\nand tools are transforming the experience.\nEvery aspect of the webinar will be reimagined, from the production to the speaker presentations and attendee experience. Polls, chat, and Q&A have become table stakes engagement features but they're now\nbeing redesigned\nto be even more interactive and immersive. Clickable CTAs in the platform help continue the buyer's journey, and companies are putting more resources into developing tools that can measure ROI accurately and effectively. You want people to show up, but more importantly, you want the webinar to translate into sales and revenue.\nAdoption of the B2B Influencer\nAlthough more popular in the B2C industries, influencers are becoming a more significant part of marketing strategies for B2B companies in 2023.\nInfluencers can reach new target audiences and create a connection that might not have been possible. They build trust for a company and generate more leads by connecting to a wider market.\nThe key to a successful B2B influencer marketing strategy is to select an influencer who is knowledgeable about your industry and can speak to the needs of your target audience. Ideally, you should create a long-term relationship with them as your brand ambassador.\nIt's also important that the influencer has a genuine interest in your company and what you do. The goal is to create interesting and informative content, not a sales pitch in disguise.\nLook for influencers with years of experience in their industry or a clear history of success.\nA B2B influencer strategy can be highly effective and help you reach your target market more organically.\nConclusion\nLearning the strategies and trends for the upcoming year is critical for any marketer who wants to stay ahead of the competition.\nBy understanding what is popular and effective, you can create a plan to help your company succeed. Use the advice in this article to inform how your company moves forward with its marketing goals. Implementing the right strategy will help ensure a successful future for your business.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/b2b-marketing-trends-strategies-for-2023\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

Ask yourself this: how many times have you hired a new vendor without knowing anything about them? If a potential hire gave you interesting and useful information about what they do, would that nudge you into hiring them over someone who didn’t communicate with you at all?\nContent is information. The information you present about yourself, and the way you present it, is sometimes the only key anyone has to knowing you exist at all. B2B content marketing is about presenting high-quality content to your target audience and establishing your existence, leading to brand awareness.\nWith the rise of AI-influenced content creation (ChatGPT anyone), your B2B content marketing strategy needs to capture the attention of your B2B buyers like a viral social media clip. Target audiences are looking for the types of content that grab them in seconds - effective content formats have to be relevant, original, and hit a pain point fast. B2B buyers may take their time to make purchasing decisions, but your initial presence has to get brand awareness hitting like lightning before you can think about lead conversions.\nUnlike a TikToker, you can’t just post up any old piece of content and hope organic traffic will magically result in qualified leads and new customers for your sales team. There is science and process behind a successful B2B content marketing strategy, and posting not good content but great content that leads to conversions.\nStart at the top of your sales funnel.\nCreate buyer personas so you know who the decision-makers are who are consuming your content at all points of the buyer’s journey. B2B buyers may be more likely to hang out on Linkedin than, say Instagram for example. Digital marketing efforts should be based on data with proven ROI.\nCreate a content calendar with a publishing plan. Make use of informational topic clusters (multiple pieces of content grouped by a shared topic and related subtopics) that build a trust-value relationship and establish your brand as subject matter experts.\nOffer assets like educational content in whitepapers, case studies and email newsletters, which can be downloaded and referred to repeatedly.\nHost interactive opportunities like\nlive webinars\n, then make that single piece of content work for you in multiple ways.\nMake use of backlinks like this one\n, to guide your reader to additional resources!\nDon’t ignore your metrics - gauge search engine results, audit your KPIs to see where to place new content, and boost the areas where existing content has been successful.\nGet your marketing team and your sales team aligned on your B2B content marketing strategy so everyone is on the same page and communicating the same message to potential customers.\nRemember that B2B companies consist of human beings, who are looking for value and insights into the things that matter to them. While your content marketing efforts should be focused on lead generation, true high-quality content in a marketing campaign will always have real value on its own.\n‍\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/why-content-marketing-is-important-for-b2b\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

In fact,\n89% of marketers believe\nwebinars outperform other channels in influencing pipeline and revenue. It's no secret that webinars are valuable lead gen tools, but to succeed at them, you need the right people entering the top of the funnel.\nA question that gets asked often is, \"\nHow do I increase registrations to my webinar and get people to show up?\n\"\nSo what's the secret sauce to generating webinar leads and getting people to attend?\nHere's what you need to know:\nTips to Boost Webinar Registrations\nTo get people to sign up, you need to focus on getting in front of the right people and optimizing the registration process. Here's how you can do that:\n1. Optimize Your Webinar Registration Form\nOne key element often overlooked is the webinar registration form. It's the gateway to your virtual event, so show it some love. This includes everything from making it easy to fill out to getting the form copy right.\nSo what makes an optimized registration form?\nKeep it short\n. When it comes to form fields, less is more. According to\nHubSpot\n, the optimal number of fields to have are three. It's a balancing act between business needs and user experience, but slimming down your form to gather the least amount of information possible will reduce drop-off.\nUse smart fields.\nA great feature of marketing automation platforms like HubSpot is\nsmart fields\n. Smart fields keep your leads from doing unnecessary work by removing form fields that a customer or lead has previously submitted.\nDesign using a single-column layout\n. A single-column layout has\nbeen proven\nmore effective in driving conversions than multiple columns on the same page. They offer better flow, resulting in better UX.\nOptimize for mobile.\nDon't forget about mobile-friendly design when creating your form. Make form fields and submit buttons finger size (generally 44x44 is the best size). Limited the amount of typing needed by using dropdown menus, radio buttons, and auto-selected answers, and use easy-to-read fonts.\nUse Quick Registration Links.\nIncluding Welcome's Quick Registration link in your promo emails, invitees can simply access your webinar via the link provided.\n2. Add CTAs to Unexpected Areas\nEmail is the top promotional channel for webinars. On average, up to 57% of registrations come from that channel. It's a given that you'll add call-to-action buttons to email invites and social posts, but here are several other areas to add CTAs:\nAdd a CTA banner to your website\nLink a CTA to your email signatures\nPromote through your newsletters\nAdd a CTA for your next event during your current webinar\nTake stock of all your digital assets and think of innovative ways to get your message out.\n3. Create a Virtual Events Page\nIf you consistently host webinars, create an events page to post all of your upcoming and on-demand events. Like Welcome’s own\nevent page\n, the page serves as a repository for all future planned events to which website visitors can be directed. This allows you to capture new sign-ups that may not already be in your email marketing database. Better yet, by adding your past events as gated on-demand videos to the events page, you can continue to increase viewership long after the webinar wraps.\nPlanning a webinar? Check out the\nWebinar Best Practices Guide\nto ensure your webinar program is a success!\n4. Promote your event up until showtime\nWe recommend promoting your webinar with various touchpoints, including the day of your event. Standard practice is to start promoting your webinar two weeks before showtime. However, 29% of people register for webinars on the same day that they are taking place. As most webinar registrations occur closer to the event, continue to promote it across your marketing channels.\n5. Add Webinar Partnerships to Your Strategy\nBuilding partnerships with like-minded brands is a win-win situation for both companies involved. Joint webinars can significantly increase the number of registrants and quickly grow the email list of both partners. By co-hosting a webinar, you double your marketing efforts and reach if you carefully select your partner. Only choose partners that will commit to promoting the event and ask them which marketing activities they plan to execute.\nManage expectations as early as possible and get alignment on the following:\nWhether the registrant list and emails will be shared\nIf there will be a shared recording\nWhen you and your partner will announce the webinars in your email marketing and social media\n‍\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops! Something went wrong.\nTips to Boost Webinar Attendance\nGetting people to sign up for your webinar is only half the battle; you need them to show up too. Here are five ways to increase the attendance rate:\n1. Host Webinar During Optimal Days/Times\nThe first step in getting people to attend your webinar is choosing the most popular day and time to host one. As a rule of thumb, avoid hosting webinars on Monday and Friday and aim for the middle of the week. The best day to host a webinar is Thursday, with\n26% of viewers\npreferring to join webinars that day, followed by Tuesday (23%) and Wednesday (21%).\nNot only is the day important, but the time of day is essential too.\n28% of people\nprefer to join webinars mid-morning, and 27% prefer mid-afternoon.\n2. Use Webinar Reminder Emails to Keep in Touch\nSo your invitee signed up, fantastic! But the webinar is still a way out, and you want to ensure the people who register actually come. Set up an email cadence that reminds attendees of the upcoming event that leads with the benefit of the webinar at every touchpoint. There is a fine line of over-emailing, so be sensitive to their inbox. Don't bombard them with tons of emails; keep it limited to only three reminders.\nThe complete email cadence can look like this:\nPost-registration follow-up confirmation email\nFirst reminder: Sent 1 week from the webinar\nSecond reminder: Sent 1 day before the webinar\nThird reminder: Sent 1 hour before the webinar\nOn-the-fence reminder: Send your final promotional email on the day of the webinar to people who've opened previous emails but did not register\nFirst follow-up: \"Here's your recording!\"\nSecond follow-up: \"Additional resources\"\nThird follow-up: \"Future events\"\n3. Don't forget about on-demand recordings\nJust because the live event is over doesn't mean you should stop driving attendance. Audiences today like to consume content on their own time, so don't sleep on the value that on-demand recordings can bring. The attendance of on-demand recordings tends to be higher, too, as registrants sign up and attend the event when they're most excited and interested.\nIn fact, around\n30% of your audience\nwill watch the on-demand version of your webinar rather than the live event, so it's worth making your content readily available.\n4. Incentivize attendance\nIf you haven't used eGifts yet to drive webinar attendance, you might miss out on a cost-effective way to get high-quality leads. Think back to every trade show or industry event you've been to and all the swag given away at booths. Just as in-booth swag can be used to drive visitors, so can webinar giveaways. It's standard practice to give away free things in the event world, so giving gifts during your virtual event shouldn't feel out of place.\nTry incentivizing people who register if they share the event on social media or simply giving them a gift for showing up. Take a Sendoso customer as an example. The gifting platform customer, Lessonly, had a\n60% virtual event attendance\nrate for one of their events. They sent Starbucks' eGifts the day before they hosted an intimate conversation with their CEO, \"Coffee Connection, \" and saw attendance soar. Even though giveaways add to your bottom line, sending eGifts can be one of the most impactful things you can do to boost attendance.\n5. Always add value\nThe last tip for driving attendance has to do with the quality of content you provide. Even if you have the\nbest webinar platform\nin the world, if you don’t prioritize your content and provide valuable insights, you’ll lose out on return visitors. Great webinars can draw up to 40%, if not more, repeat visitors, but they'll only come back if they feel their time was well spent.\n70% of B2B professionals\nseek tips, tricks, and best practices. So make sure your webinars are actionable and educational, not just an extended sales pitch.\nTo wrap it all up\nThere are so many different tactics for generating leads for your webinar. And the perfect promotion strategy for your business will depend on how your audience responds to each one.\nThe tips above are good starting points but by no means an exhaustive list of everything you can try.

With the B2B marketers' challenges always changing and B2B marketing technology becoming increasingly complex, it can be challenging to understand what's critical, what's important, and what is just a “nice to have.”\n‍\nBelow we’ll outline the types of B2B marketing technologies, share our list of top solutions in the market, and share how critical they are to your business so that you can build the best B2b Marketing Tech Stack suited for your business.\n‍\nMarketing Automation Platforms (MAPs)\n‍\nMarketing automation platforms are at the core of any B2B marketing tech stack. They are NOT just an email marketing tool. These platforms are used to capture lead and contact data, segment your audience, automate email marketing and nurture campaigns, build and automate workflows, build and publish forms, automate social media posting, manage advertising campaigns, measure key metrics, create dashboards or reports, build lead scoring processes, and so much more.\n‍\nSome marketing automation platforms, like Hubspot, can\ndouble as your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool\nso that you can manage your marketing automation and activities using the platform and your sales and customer support activities.\n‍\nThese tools start to get\nexponentially more powerful through leveraging integrations\nwith other tools and resources. Marketing automation platforms will often integrate with your CRM, sales automation and enablement tools, billing and invoicing solutions, customer data solutions, advertising solutions, and more. This allows you to a) leverage your marketing data to trigger something to happen in another system or tool (ex. send an invoice or alert a sales rep) or b) listen for events in other systems to then trigger activity in your marketing automation platform (ex. if prospect interacts with an advertisement, add to nurture list in your marketing automation platform).\n‍\nTop B2B Marketing Automation Platforms:\nHubspot - For small and midsize organizations but can scale to enterprise\nMarketo - For complex automation processes and nurture campaigns\nPardot - For organizations that want to keep all data centralized within Salesforce\nEloqua - For mid to large-size organizations\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nCRITICAL. Think of your marketing automation platform as the foundation of your entire marketing technology stack.\nContent Management Systems (CMS)\n‍\nContent Management Systems, or a CMS, is software that helps you… you guessed it… manage your content. But not any content; Content Management Systems are specific to helping you\nmanage content on your website\nwithout needing a designer or intimate knowledge of HTML and CSS.\n‍\nThese tools make it very easy for you to create landing page templates, blog templates, pricing pages, purchasing pages, host or store media (images, audio, video), and capture data and leads with built-in form builders. Many of these tools also integrate with Google Analytics and have Search Engine Optimization (SEO) functionality built to ensure your website is optimized to capture web traffic. But which one is right for you and your business? Below is a list of top CMS providers.\n‍\nTop B2B Marketing Content Management Systems (CMS)\nWebflow\n-For organizations that value design and flexibility out of the box\nWordPress- For organizations that value integrations and ease of use\nDrupal- For organizations that are conscious of budget and like to build\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nCRITICAL. Your website is a 24/7 selling machine. It’s how your audience will find you and learn about you.\n‍\nSearch Engine Optimization and Management (SEO and SEM)\nSearch Engine Optimization and Management tools are often forgotten and not the first solution a B2B marketer may think of purchasing or configuring- but they should. SEO tools and SEM solutions are arguably the most powerful marketing tools in your marketing tech stack for creating and capturing demand.\n‍\nHow do you know if people will find you if they search for your company?\nWill people find you if they search for a problem that you solve? Or for a related topic?\nDo you know what your audience is interested in and what content you should generate in the first place?\n‍\nWhen your audience is searching for something, it means they have a problem that needs a solution. There is no better time in the buyer journey to ensure you show up as one of the solutions they should evaluate. SEO and SEM tools help you execute keyword research, uncover keyword ranking difficulty, and help you track your progress for keywords or phrases you want to improve.\n‍\nTop SEO solutions:\nGoogle Analytics - Analyze web traffic and where it's coming from\nGoogle Search Console - Execute keyword research and analyze search data for your audience\nTop SEM solutions:\nSEMRush - Keyword research, manage keywords and understand ranking difficulty\nAhrefs - Keyword research, manage keywords and understand ranking difficulty. It also has many free, lightweight tools to get you started.\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nCRITICAL.\n‍\nPaid Advertising Analytics and Management\nAlmost every marketing strategy will include investments in paid advertising, especially digital marketing strategies. Paid is one of the most tried and true marketing channels for lead generation and pipeline creation. It’s also one of the more effective ways to test your content marketing strategy and see what messaging resonates with your audience.\n‍\nBut what tools should you use in your marketing technology stack to support your paid strategy? Well… as every marketing operations professional will tell you, it depends. It depends on your target persona and ICP, what they care about, and where they hang out.\n‍\nIf your persona doesn’t live on LinkedIn, you probably don’t want to spend money advertising there, right? Or maybe your target persona is not problem aware AT ALL, so they would never search for a solution, then spending paid on search isn’t going to be that helpful either. It’s vital to figure out WHERE your audience and persona are because if you don’t, your marketing teams will waste time, effort, and money, yielding a minimal return on investment.\n‍\nAfter you understand your persona and where they hang out, the following tools can help you get the most out of your advertising spend and supercharge marketing campaigns across the board.\n‍\nTop Paid B2B Marketing solutions:\nGoogle Adwords - If your persona is problem aware and searching for answers or solutions, you’ll want to leverage Google Adwords\nWordStream- An all-in-one digital advertising solution that can help you manage paid search and Facebook display ads\nSkai - Similar to Wordstream, an all-in-one omnichannel digital advertising solution\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nCRITICAL.\n‍\nWebinars and Virtual Events\n‍\nOne of\nthe most cost-effective ways to generate leads and convert those leads into revenue\nis by having a strong webinar and/or virtual event program\n. Not only do these programs generate and capture leads, but it's also the most cost-effective way to generate content, as you have an endless supply of long-form content to\nrepurpose into short-form content\n.\nIllustration of repurposing content\n‍\nDeciding which webinar platform or virtual event solution is right for you may be more complex than it seems, though. Does it need to integrate into your B2B marketing tech stack? How good of an attendee experience does it need to be? Do you need branding? Do you need to engage with your audience live? How will you repurpose the content (or do you even care about that)?\n‍\nTop Webinar and Virtual Event Platforms:\nWelcome\n- Best in-class webinar and virtual event platform used by organizations that care about how their brand is perceived and their attendees' experience, typically used from B2B marketers to generate leads, content, and revenue.\nOn24\n- Standard webinar platform with many live and on-demand features\nZoom Webinar\n- Reliable, easy-to-use platform for marketers who may not care about brand perception, audience engagement, or attendee experience. Typically used by small businesses and small startups.\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nImportant.\nWebsite Optimization and Personalization\n‍\nSo you’ve built a website and successfully drove traffic to it through paid advertising, social media, and search- but how do you make sure you’re optimizing your site to convert that traffic into paying customers? You don’t want all those marketing efforts going to waste, but A/B testing your website and landing pages can be very time-consuming. This is where website optimization and personalization platforms can help supercharge your inbound marketing efforts.\n‍\nImagine leveraging data in your marketing automation platform to deliver a tailored customer experience for everyone that comes to your website. You know what ads they’ve interacted with, emails they’ve engaged with, and events or webinars they’ve attended- why not use that data through integrations to help convert them to paying customers when they visit your website?\n‍\nHere are some of the top platforms and solutions to leverage for personalization and optimization.\n‍\nTop Website Optimization and Personalization solutions:\nMutiny- No-code AI conversion platform that creates personalized experiences\nAct-On- Delivers scalable personalization and optimization through powerful marketing automation functionality\nHotJar- Provides data and insight into what is helpful to your audience, and what isnt, allowing for faster A/B testing on your website.\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nImportant.\n‍\nSocial Media Management\n‍\nWhile it depends on your target persona and marketing strategy, you’ll likely be leveraging social media marketing as part of your strategy. And if you’re leveraging social media to support your marketing strategy, you’ll find it can be painful to manually manage communications and marketing content across LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and more.\n‍\nEnter social media marketing platforms. They enable you to compose, schedule, and distribute content across all social media platforms in one view. They can also provide you with analytics across all your social media platforms in near real-time, enabling you to make quick, data-driven decisions for your business.\n‍\nTop Social Media Management solutions:\nHootsuite\nSprout Social\nAgorapulse\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nImportant. More important if social media is a key part of your marketing strategy.\nAccount-Based Marketing (ABM)\n‍\nBefore we start, what is Account Based Marketing? Or ABM? Account Based marketing is a marketing strategy to focus efforts around specific accounts instead of your target market as a whole. Examples could be executing personalized marketing campaigns specific to that account, coordinating with your sales team to conduct a joint marketing and sales blitz, building custom-tailored content for those accounts, or all of the above. It’s a strategy that’s typically deployed to acquire logos over $100k in value, as the unit economics don’t necessarily work out if your average deal size is smaller.\n‍\nIf account-based marketing is part of your strategy, you know it can be challenging to manage and create these hyperpersonal campaigns in a scalable way. That’s where ABM platforms come into the picture- they help you manage all these channels across the board for an individual account. They also help alert you or your sales team when you have website visitors from your target accounts that show buying intent.\n‍\nTop Account-Based Marketing Solutions:\nDemandBase\nMetadata\n6sense\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nImportant if your average deal size is large.\n‍\nCustomer Loyalty and Gifting\n‍\nAs we head into 2023 with an unstable economic environment, customer retention has never been more critical. It’s no surprise that Customer Marketing roles are becoming more and more common as companies need to continually market the value of their products and services to help improve customer and revenue retention. One tactic that can be effective, but is often overlooked, is simply showing gratitude to your customers. Celebrating THEIR milestones as they continue to use your product and services is another fantastic way to strengthen your relationship with your customers.\n‍\nEnter Customer Loyalty and Gifting solutions. These solutions integrate directly into your CRM or Marketing Automation Platform and can be triggered to send your customer (or prospect) a gift automatically. In addition, marketing and sales teams can leverage these tools as part of their Account Based Marketing campaigns.\n‍\nTop Customer Loyalty and Gifting Solutions:\nLoop & Tie\nAlyce\nPostal\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nImportant if you’re focusing on customer retention.\n‍\nNice To Have Technology\nChatbots\n- It’s very likely your Marketing Automation Platform has a built-in solution for chatbots. Still, if you need more flexibility or customization, tools like\nQualified\nshould be considered.\n‍\nCalendar Schedulers-\nSimilar to chatbots, your Marketing Automation Platform likely has some solution already, but if you need more automation tools or routing abilities, tools like Calendly and Chili Piper should be considered.\n‍\nAnalytics Tools-\nOver time, you will have a large amount of data to analyze and outgrow your current reporting tools and capabilities. Whether that's attribution modeling, AI analytics, or automated forecasting tools, a wide range of solutions can support your needs.\n‍\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops! Something went wrong.\nB2B Marketing Tech Stack- Conclusion\n‍\nThere is much to consider when selecting your tech stack. The most important thing is understanding the marketing strategy your CMO or marketing leader puts in place and prioritizing your B2B marketing tech spend and time around those priorities.\n‍\nAnd remember,\nsoftware and tools don’t generate revenue- strategy and process do\n. Marketing technology only enhances current strategies and methods. If you have BAD processes or a bad strategy, these tools will only worsen things.\n‍\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/b2b-marketing-tech-stack\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

And it's even more evident that we are not working as we did. The collective experience we've all had has made a lasting imprint that is evolving the way we work.\nAccording to\nLadders\n, 25% of all professional jobs in North America will be remote by the end of 2022. And remote opportunities will continue to increase through 2023.\nWe brought three CEOs together from Scoop, Bucketlist Rewards, and Welcome to learn how they're leading their distributed teams and what they're seeing and predicting for the next 12 to 24 months.\nMissed this session? Read the summary below or\naccess the recording here\n.\nFeatured panelists:\nRoberto Ortiz\n, CEO & CoFounder of\nWelcome\nRob Sadow\n, CEO & CoFounder of\nScoop Technologies\nJason Lindstrom\n, CEO of\nBucketlist Rewards\nQ: We're seeing that a lot of knowledge workers want flexibility. What are you seeing as the pros and cons of flexible work?\n‍\nRoberto Ortiz started the session by discussing the pros of a more flexible way of work, beginning with the benefits. \"Flexibility benefits the employee when they have choices where to live, but it also benefits the employer to be flexible to employ people from around the world.\"\n\"Being more flexible has forced us to restructure how we meet and is causing us to rethink how we operate from the ground up. The cons are the level of intention it takes to run a successful organization today versus two years ago. To some, it can look like a con because it looks like more work. But this is the fast-track way to becoming a more future-oriented workforce. Companies must do the work to figure out how to drive a more equitable experience for distributed teams and ensure they have the right technology in place.\"\nRob Sadow spoke about the impact flexible workplaces have on the local economies. \"One of the huge benefits I see is the ability to enable talent in local markets to have access to more jobs and, as a result, build local economies. Certain metros or cities hogged up talent in tech, so the idea that people can be more distributed now and work in different locations is extremely powerful.\"\nQ: How are you managing flexibility for your company, balancing productivity and wellness so employees don't experience burnout?\n‍\nRob shared that Scoop has started offering company-wide time off. \"We took off the whole week of July 4th and the week between Christmas and New Year's. We found that when everybody's work stops, the likelihood of you getting pinged with something else while you're out of the office goes down. People still take their PTO, but having those moments of pause on the calendar has been a good refresher for folks trying to find some balance.\"\nAt Bucketlist, Jason Lindstrom said they started struggling with work/life balance when they became a distributed company with employees worldwide and trying to manage multiple time zones. \"We built a playbook policy on distributed work. One of the best takeaways is that we have a four-hour overlap where we expect everybody to be available on Slack, email, etc. Outside those hours, people can set their own boundaries regarding family time or health and wellness.\"\n‍\nQ: Managing distributed teams is evolving the way we communicate and lead. What are the challenges you're currently encountering with that? How do you see this will evolve in the future?\n‍\nRoberto believes we're just scratching the surface regarding the tools and technology required for remote workforces. \"There's a ton of new technology that has to be built as we're experiencing new challenges. As technologists, we must figure out how to improve those problems. For example, hosting an\nall-hands meeting\non Zoom and recognizing it doesn't feel engaging. I don't feel the music, I don't feel the presence, I don't feel the energy that I want to feel that requires a new way of thinking to better engage your employees. What is the current status quo, and is the status quo good enough? I think we're never satisfied with the status quo; there's always a better way of doing it. When you look into employee communication and management, one side of it is technology based, but a lot of it is around policy and intentionality around investing in middle managers. Before Covid, there was a different manager that never managed a distributed team before. They relied on seeing their team in the office, walking in the door at 8am and out at 5pm. And that's how they measured success. Those managers will have a hard time if they don't change how they work, so I think equipping middle managers is essential.\"\nRob commented that companies tend to spend a lot of time worrying about the hardware and the tooling needed, but half of what is required are soft skills. \"If I had to guess before the pandemic, 1 to every thousand or ten thousand managers had previously managed a remote or hybrid team. The collective knowledge and\nbest practices of managing a remote workforce\nare relatively minimal. Managers have to get better in this world. This means you have to be more thoughtful on what the output is you're trying to drive, how folks on the team contribute to that output, and how you find the right balance around checking in personally, professionally, and supporting them.\"\n‍\nQ: From a tactical perspective, what signals do you look for in your remote teams? We often see someone in a virtual box; how are you picking up on their cues?\n‍\nJason shared some experiences Bucketlist uses to unearth emotional cues. \"We've created ten questions team leads will ask employees during their weekly 1:1 meetings. One question they ask is, what is the best thing to happen to you this week, whether in or outside of work? We want to make it feel safe for people to talk about what's happening in their lives. Another subtle question is asking, on a scale from 1 to 10, how happy are you and why. Often we walk around in life and ask others how are you doing, and they say fine. But in reality, maybe they are struggling with rent, or sadly their dad just died. But fine is the same answer across the board. When you ask a number out of ten, people will give you a more realistic response, and then you can dig deeper if they want to share more. I've also found people have different baselines. Some people are naturally a 7 out of 10 week over week, others a 9. Then you can watch the trend line. If someone is usually a 9, but lately they've been a 4, something is going on that you may want to learn more about.\"\n‍\nQ: What is the one top prediction you're excited about and prioritizing for your organization?\n‍\nRob believes that most of the world that can operate remotely will do so in a hybrid environment, not just next year but into the future. \"The biggest barrier around hybrid is the ability for people to work at the right place and at the right time. This means you're home on the right days and in the office on the right days, and you can get the right people together. We spend all of our energy from a product perspective trying to make that as easy as possible. Hybrid is the future for most people, and intentionality around that is extremely important.\nRoberto thinks about the short and long term and the in-between. \"There will be many more digital nomads, and more people owning their careers and prioritizing life first, then work. I think that's the significant shift that will happen. The belief is that I want to live this certain life; therefore, I work this way. There's a journey in equipping people to think like that, not just for employees but employers. Make sure people\nknow the expectations as an employee\n, and make certain the expectations are outcome driven. As a leader, saying this is what excellence looks like at the job, now go be excellent and live an excellent life on your terms. I think the foundation is trust, and that's the big shift that will need to happen in employment.\nMissed the session?\nWatch the entire event here\nfor top trends and predictions for leading distributed teams in 2023.\n‍\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/top-trends-predictions-leading-distributed-teams-2023\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

Even as the long-awaited sliver of “normalcy” continues to grow wider with more vaccines rolled out each day, there’s no denying that the fabric of the events space has been altered for good. As with any new frontier, we were bound to make a few missteps along the way. From monotonous webinars to poorly organized online conferences, there’s a good chance you’ve attended at least one cringe-worthy event over the past year that had you walking away, thinking: “ouch, I hope my next event doesn’t go like that!”\nSo what can you do to ensure that your virtual experiences don’t become sleep-inducers,\nor worse\n, objects of ridicule? Here are the five of the most common mistakes we’ve witnessed, plus practical ways to prevent them.\n‍\n‍\n1. Trying to replicate in-person events online\nWe've all seen them. Hours-long presentations with attendees tuning out. Forced breakouts masquerading as networking \"opportunities\" where conversation is stiff and connections are merely surface-level. Q&A sessions with no actual questions in sight.\nAfter a rapid scramble to pivot to online events, we now know that the tactics that seemed like no-brainers for producing successful in-person gatherings don’t necessarily work in the virtual arena. The key is delivering the excitement and experiential factor of in-person events, but knowing when to stray from the same old strategy to prevent your event from falling flat.\nOur suggestions:\nReframe the move to virtual events as an opportunity to innovate instead of replicate.\nTighten up your agenda and remember that long content blocks won't go over as well virtually as they might in-person.\nCasual conversations just don’t happen as easily online. It’s your job to take on a more active role in facilitating connections by providing a little extra guidance. Decide on clear topics for breakout rooms (kept to a small number of participants) and spell out exactly where attendees should go to connect with each other.\nTwo of the strongest benefits of virtual events are the improved accessibility and ability to re-package and share them. Make it as easy as possible for attendees to access content from your event through bite-size video clips, recap posts, or even a full-fledged content library.\n2. Losing track of your event goals\nWhy are we here? Are we trying to gain leads, close deals, or educate existing customers? All three, perhaps. Or maybe the goal is to have fun and foster connections within your remote team. There's no wrong answer—it's part of the flexibility of virtual events—but it's important to keep your goal top of mind throughout the entire planning process.\nOur suggestions:\nAsk yourself the following questions: Does the content you're creating serve this goal? Is the event pacing aligned with the stated goal? What are the key insights your attendees should walk away with?\nAdopt an\nattendee-first mentality\n. It's crucial that attendees never ask themselves, \"why am I here?\" Attention spans are short online, so someone who jumps into the event should immediately see that what you're offering is valuable to them.\nMake sure to tie results to your goals. Far before the event takes place, decide on the KPIs that matter most to you (e.g. Net Promoter Score, chat and poll participation, number of repeat attendees or new leads) and make sure that you’re able to grab those metrics through your event platform of choice.\nPlanning a webinar? Check out the\nWebinar Best Practices Guide\nto ensure your webinar program is a success!\n‍\n3. Under-structuring your event\nAwkward pauses. Speakers who don’t show up when they’re supposed to. Disarray, everywhere. Just those thoughts alone are enough to get any event producer’s skin crawling. A lot of things can go wrong during live events, but the anxiety is amplified ten-fold in a virtual environment, where you’re at the mercy of the tech working. Preparation is key here. Start planning early and nail down every single detail so there’s no room for confusion or chaos.\nOur suggestions:\nDesign a clearly written event brief and share it with anyone who’s involved in planning the event. For a panel conversation, for example, plan out the run-of-show to the tee, from which questions to ask the panelists to when the Q&A should start.\nPost your agenda in advance and avoid spending too much time intro-ing what’s to come, while still adequately preparing your audience.\nDevelop a contingency plan in case things go south. Think through all the potential concerns—including tech troubles, late entrances, no-shows—and brainstorm how you’d deal with them if they were to happen.\n‍\n“Gatherings crackle and flourish when real thought goes into them, when (often invisible) structure is baked into them.” — Priya Parker,\nThe Art of Gatherings\n4. Going without an event host\nYour attendees need a guide, and so do your speakers. A great emcee or moderator will act as the glue of your event, transitioning speakers smoothly and confidently while leading the audience from start to finish.\nOur Suggestions:\nA key point: pay attention to your emcee's style. Their energy will be matched by both attendees and speakers, so pick someone who's aligned with your event's vibe. A skilled emcee will know how to strike the right balance of authentic, enthusiastic, and warm. Ideally they’re well accustomed to improvising with grace and staying hyper-focused on what’s happening on the virtual stage.\nGoing back to goals, make sure to relay the event objectives to your emcee so they can appropriately guide the event.\n5. Ignoring the value of a rehearsal\nIn order to reduce major day-of stress, make sure that your event host, speakers, and behind-the-scenes producers feel comfortable with your event platform and are familiarized with the run-of-show and responsibilities. It's almost a guarantee that someone will have technical issues, a less than ideal background, or misplace their speaker notes. The more you can prepare ahead of time, the better.\n‍\nOur Suggestions:\nHave at least one dry run ahead of your event. Make these mandatory whenever possible.\nShare a speaker kit—or simply a condensed version of the event brief—so that all speakers know exactly what to expect, from rehearsal times to introductory scripts.\nMake sure your speakers are fully briefed on the platform they’re using, and if not, give them a quick training. Get them logged in, ask about their internet connection in advance, and check their lighting and sound.\nProducing a virtual event is no easy feat. Though nearly every event will inevitably come with an unexpected surprise or two, we hope these tips serve as a starting point for producing polished virtual experiences that have attendees raving. Your guests, speakers, and teammates will thank you.\nAbout Welcome\nFrom our interactive polling feature to our state-of-the-art production studio, each of Welcome’s features add up to provide a truly exceptional virtual experience platform. One that not only works seamlessly for an event of any size, but delivers meaningful engagement and data-backed results—all while looking stunningly beautiful.

However, this is becoming harder than ever. The market is extremely crowded, budgets are tightening, and your buyers are being bombarded with messages. How do you make sure you stand out from the crowd and create an effective and efficient B2B demand generation engine? The answers may surprise you!\n‍\nIdentify and target your ideal customer\n‍\nThis point may be obvious, but most people in b2b marketing miss the mark. Without having a clear idea of your target, you are essentially throwing darts against the wall. The mistake that most demand-gen marketers make is not being specific enough. A broad ideal customer increases your competitive surface area and dilutes your messaging. For example, if you sell financial reporting software, a poor ideal customer is “CFOs”. Every company passed a certain size will have a CFO, so this is too broad for lead generation.\n‍\nIn order to get more specific, think about the product you’re selling and what pain points it will solve for customers along specific dimensions. Some of those dimensions could be:\nCompany size: Is your product easy to set up and use? If your competitors’ software is clunky and takes a lot of onboarding to use, consider targeting smaller companies. Smaller companies typically have less red tape when it comes to evaluating new software. Also, people take on multiple roles in smaller companies, so they will tend to value software that they can try right away. Contact information can also be easier to find for smaller companies, since their executives may not be on everyone’s CRM.\nIndustry: Specific industries have unique pain points that you can target. For example, highly regulated industries like financial services and medicine will have strict compliance requirements. This will let you speak to how your software can easily fulfill those requirements and gain quick adoption. Different industries may respond differently depending on the channel. For example, email marketing is likely to be more effective than LinkedIn in certain industries like hospitality. Keep this in mind when creating your marketing campaigns.\nLocation: Different countries have various laws and ways of doing business. Even within the United States, there are different work cultures on the east and west coasts. Targeting specific locations will allow you to speak their language, both literally and figuratively. A recent founder I spoke with has a fintech company that helps low-income workers get payday loans through their employers. Their inbound marketing took off as soon as he moved his target customer from Spain to Colombia.\n‍\nGetting a clear idea of your ideal customer will work wonders for your marketing team.\n‍\nCreate original content to drive conversions\n‍\nOnce you’ve narrowed in on your target customer, you’ll want to create original content. Content marketing is the backbone of every demand-generation strategy. Whether you are looking to increase your paid or organic traffic, original content is key. You can no longer get away with the same blog articles that people have read a million times. To stand out above the noise, you’ll need to be insightful and original. With the rise in AI-generated content, this is becoming harder than ever.\n‍\nHow do you do that? While different types of content exist, video is by far the best-performing. Many marketers have this misconception that video is difficult and expensive to produce. That is no longer true.\nWebinar platforms\nlike Welcome allow you to host live discussions on topics of interest and automatically create short-form content. These short-form videos can be repurposed for blog articles, social media, and e-mail newsletters without the need for a dedicated video team.\n‍\nIn addition to higher conversion rates from video, live conversations specifically can create insights through moderated conversations. When you are engaged in a lively conversation, you can bounce ideas off of other people and generate insights more easily than you can by yourself.\n‍\nThis isn’t to say that traditional marketing content like white papers and case studies is not effective. But they need to be coupled with a solid SEO strategy in order to be effective. One of the best tools I’ve seen to help you create SEO-friendly content is\nClearscope\n. In fact, I’m writing this article using that tool right now!\n‍\nUse automation whenever possible\n‍\nOver the past few years, there has been a Cambrian explosion of marketing automation tools.\nHubspot\n,\nMarketo\nand\nSalesforce\ncan all help automate demand generation campaigns. They can also help you track relevant metrics (like MQLs, qualified leads, intent data)  to optimize your buyer’s journey. These tools can be indispensable in executing your demand-gen strategy.\n‍\nOne way we’ve leveraged automation at Welcome is to create a list of target accounts in Hubspot. These target accounts are divided into several tiers, depending on how confidently we believe they can be converted into potential customers. Within these accounts, we target individuals who match our buyer personas. Since our CRM and marketing automation systems are connected, we know exactly where someone is in the buying journey and can target them accordingly.\nLearn and adjust quickly\n‍\nThe world is moving faster than ever, and your marketing strategy needs to adapt. To successfully generate demand, you’ll always need to be relevant to the challenges that your customers are facing. Not all of the content that you generate will be a hit. It’s important that you constantly refine and test your messaging. One of the best ways to do this is through A/B testing, which involves experimenting with different elements such as headlines, images, or calls to action. This can help you identify what’s working and what’s not, and make changes where needed. Your sales team can be a great source of feedback here, as content works really well for moving high-quality leads through the sales funnel.\n‍\nOne mistake I often see marketers make is using a “spray and pray” strategy. They’ll try ABM (account-based marketing) to target high-level decision-makers one moment, then focus on brand awareness the next moment. Then the next moment they’ll try influencer marketing. Digital marketing often takes a while to get going. It could take 3-6 months before you see the fruits of your marketing efforts really start to pay off.\n‍\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops!

CONFIDENTIALITY\n4.1 Each party (the “Receiving Party”) understands that the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) has disclosed or may disclose business, technical, or financial information relating to the Disclosing Party’s business (hereinafter referred to as “Confidential Information” of the Disclosing Party).  Confidential Information of Company includes information regarding features, functionality and performance of the Service.  Confidential Information of Customer includes all Customer Data, as defined below. The Receiving Party agrees: (i) to take reasonable precautions to protect Confidential Information against unauthorized use or disclosure, (ii) not to use Confidential Information except as reasonably necessary in connection with the performance of this Agreement or otherwise in accordance with the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent; and (iii) not disclose Confidential Information to any third parties other than the Receiving Party’s employees, agents, and service providers who are under a duty of confidentiality no less restrictive than the Receiving Party’s duty hereunder except with the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent.

CUSTOMER DATA\n5.1 As used herein, “Customer Data” means information and data that is created or displayed within or uploaded to the Services by Customer or event attendees during or as part of virtual events produced by Customer and hosted through the Services, including text, images, photos, audio clips, chat logs, audio and video recordings, and other content uploaded or shared through the Services during virtual events.\n5.2 Customer shall own all right, title and interest in and to the Customer Data, as well as any data derived from the Customer Data as part of the Services. Customer hereby grants to Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, to access, use, copy, and disclose Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services and the Implementation Services, or otherwise at Customer’s direction. Customer represents and warrants that it has the valid and enforceable right to provide to Company all Customer Data and materials furnished hereunder for use in accordance with this Agreement.  Customer represents, warrants and covenants that the Customer Data, at all times during the Term:\n‍\n(a) is provided to Company in accordance with all applicable laws, including without limitation laws related to audio and video recording, intellectual property, privacy and export control\n(b) does not infringe any intellectual property rights\n(c) does not violate the privacy, publicity, or other rights of third parties or any other law, statute, ordinance or regulation\n(d) does not misrepresent the source of the Customer Data\n(e) does not misrepresent Customer’s identity\n(f) does not contain any viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, malware, worms, time bombs, or other harmful content intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, intercept, or expropriate any system, or data.\nIf Customer becomes aware of any violation of this Agreement in connection with use of the Software or Services, Customer may contact Company at the contact information listed on the Order Form. Company may investigate complaints and violations and take actions it believes are appropriate, including, but not limited to issuing warnings, removing content or terminating accounts or attendance.  However, because situations and interpretations vary, Company also reserves the right not to take any action. Customer is solely responsible for all data or other content loaded into or viewable under the Services.\n5.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Company shall have the right to collect and analyze data and other information relating to the provision, use and performance of various aspects of the Services and related systems and technologies (including, without limitation, information concerning Customer Data and other information relating to attendees and speakers at virtual events produced by Customer through the Services, and data and insights derived therefrom) on an aggregated and anonymized basis, and Company will be free (during and after the term hereof) to (i) use such information and data internally to improve and enhance the Services and for other development, diagnostic and corrective purposes in connection with the Services and other Company offerings, and (ii) disclose such data solely in aggregate and de-identified form in connection with its business. No rights or licenses are granted except as expressly set forth herein.\n6. PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION\n6.1 Company and Customer shall comply with their respective obligations set forth\nhere\n(Customer Data Processing Addendum) with respect to the processing of any Personal Data, as defined in\nCustomer Data Processing Addendum\n, in connection with Company’s provision and Customer’s use of the Services. Provided, however, that Customer agrees that Customer Data will not contain any financial account identifiers (e.g. credit card numbers or bank account numbers), government issued identifiers (e.g. social security or driver’s license numbers,) or other types of sensitive data that is subject to specific or elevated data protection requirements such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or HIPAA (“Sensitive Personal Data”). Company shall have no liability under this Agreement for Sensitive Personal Data, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.\n6.2 Use of the Services is also subject to Company’s Privacy Policy, available at\nhttps://www.experiencewelcome.com/privacy-policy\n.\n7. PAYMENT OF FEES\n7.1 Customer will pay Company the then applicable fees described in the Order Form for the Services and Implementation Services in accordance with the terms therein (the “Fees”).  If Customer’s use of the Services exceeds the Service Capacity set forth on the Order Form or otherwise requires the payment of additional fees (per the terms of this Agreement), Customer shall be billed for such usage and Customer agrees to pay the additional fees in the manner provided herein.  Company reserves the right to change the Fees or applicable charges and to institute new charges and Fees at the end of the Initial Service Term or then current renewal term, upon thirty (30) days prior notice to Customer (which may be sent by email).

Unpaid amounts are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in termination of Service. Customer shall be responsible for all taxes associated with Services other than U.S. taxes based on Company’s net income.\n8. TERM AND TERMINATION\n8.1 Subject to earlier termination as provided below, this Agreement is for the Initial Service Term as specified in the Order Form, and shall be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same duration as the Initial Service Term (collectively, the “Term”), unless either party requests termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term.\n8.2 In addition to any other remedies it may have, either party may also terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ notice (or without notice in the case of nonpayment, fraud, negligence, willful default),  if the other party materially breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.  Customer will pay in full for the Services up to and including the last day on which the Services are provided, provided that if this Agreement is terminated part way through the Term due to Company’s fraud, negligence, willful default or material breach (“material breach” being defined as a breach of Sections 4 and/or 9 of this Agreement), Company shall refund Customer for the pro-rata amount of any fees paid in advance that relate to the terminated part of the Term. Upon any termination, Company will make all Customer Data available to Customer for electronic retrieval for a period of thirty (30) days, but thereafter Company shall delete stored Customer Data.  All sections of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, accrued rights to payment, confidentiality obligations, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.\n9. WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER\nCompany shall use reasonable efforts consistent with prevailing industry standards to maintain the Services in a manner which minimizes errors and interruptions in the Services and shall perform the Implementation Services in a professional and workmanlike manner. Services may be temporarily unavailable for scheduled maintenance or for unscheduled emergency maintenance, either by Company or by third-party providers, or because of other causes beyond Company’s reasonable control, but Company shall\nprovide seven days’ advance notice in writing or by e-mail of any scheduled service disruption. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, THE SERVICES AND IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL\nWARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n10. FORCE MAJEURE\nIn no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party, or be deemed to have breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement (except for non-payment not attributable to a force majeure event as described herein), if and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond such Party's reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, pandemic, epidemic, explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, or passage of law or any action taken by a governmental or public authority, including imposing an embargo or blackout.\n11. INDEMNIFICATION\nCompany shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Customer and its respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns from and against any third party claims, demands, suits, actions, and proceedings, including any losses, damages, judgments, settlements, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) and costs awarded by a court of final jurisdiction against\nCustomer alleging that the use of the SaaS Services in accordance with this Agreement infringes\nor misappropriates a third party’s patent rights, copyright, trademark, or trade secrets (provided, however, the foregoing shall not apply to the extent any such third-party claim is based on: (a) misuse or modification of the Services for any use other than its intended purpose or in breach of the terms of this Agreement or (b) information or materials provided by or on behalf of Customer or any\nof its affiliates; or (c) Company’s compliance with Customer’s written direction with respect to the manner in which Services are to be performed or the content to be included in the Services; provided that Company shall cooperate with Customer as may be reasonably requested by Customer to mitigate any liabilities arising from any such claim); (ii) resulting or arising out of Company’s violation of applicable laws; or (iii) a breach of Company’s warranties\n12. DATA PRIVACY\n12.1 No Disabling Code.\nCompany represents, warrants and covenants to Customer that (a) to the best of Company’s knowledge, no Software or application will contain any Disabling Code (as defined below) at the time of delivery to Customer, (b) Company will not insert any Disabling Code into any Software or application, and (c) Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to\nprevent the insertion of Disabling Code into any Software or application. As used herein, “Disabling Code” means any lock, clock, timer, counter, copy protection feature, replication device, “virus” or “worm,” as those terms are commonly used in the computer industry, or other software code that may (i) lock, disable or erase any software, application, programs or data of Customer or its\nlicensees, (ii) prevent Customer or its licensees from fully using the Software, applications or Services as permitted under this Agreement, or (iii) require action or intervention by Company or any other person to allow Customer, its licensees and its event attendees to use the software and any application as permitted under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Disabling Code shall not mean a mechanism designed to enforce a Party’s rights under this Agreement.\n‍\n12.2 Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity.\n‍\n(a) On or before the Effective Date and thereafter upon Customer’s request, Company shall provide to Customer information pertaining to its disaster recovery/business continuity plans, policies and procedures, including, without limitation, a description of the disaster recovery/business continuity protocols designed to ensure Company’s ability to provide the Services (collectively, the “DR/BC\nPlan”). Company shall comply with the DR/BC Plan so as to reasonably ensure that the Services provided to Customer shall not be disrupted. The DR/BC Plan will, in the aggregate be (a) reasonable with respect to the nature of the Services, and (b) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Company shall promptly notify Customer in writing upon learning of any failure to\ncomply with the DR/BC Plan. (b) Company shall monitor, evaluate and, in its commercially reasonable and professional discretion, adjust its DR/BC Plan in response to relevant changes in technology and internal and external threats to Company, the Services and/or any Customer Data; provided that Company shall not make any change that, alone or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affects the DR/BC Plan. (c) Customer and its designees shall be entitled to conduct documentary reviews related to the\nDR/BC Plan of Company. Company shall grant reasonable access to information reasonably required for Customer and its designees to perform such a documentary review and will make personnel available, to the extent reasonably necessary to answer questions or otherwise assist Customer and its designees in performing such a documentary review.\n‍\n12.3 Information Security.\nThe following processes and controls should be in place for anything that contains or processes Customer Data:\n1. In the event of a security breach, the provider should immediately notify the Customer team within 24 hours of the event being identified.\n2. An appropriate password policy that is in line with NIST standards.\n3. Multi-factor authentication should be setup for all critical application tooling. This is inclusive of Company’s productivity tool suite (i.e. Microsoft 365, GSuite, etc.), email access, and online file storage access.\n‍\n4. Multi-factor authentication should be setup for remote network access (i.e. VPN, Citrix, etc.)\n‍\n5. External and internal penetration tests should be conducted by a reputable third party on a minimum of an annual cadence. An executive summary of results should be available upon\nrequest by the Customer team.\n‍\n6. Security awareness training should be conducted at least annually with all employees.\n7. Phishing training should be conducted multiple times a year with all employees.\n8. For any internal or external application development, a robust DevSecOps process should be in place that includes security reviews before any code is moved to production.\n13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\nNEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (EVEN IF SUCH PARTY KNEW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), ARISING FROM BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR ARISING FROM ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, SUCH AS, BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO, LOSS OF REVENUE OR ANTICIPATED PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS.\nEXCEPT FOR ANY EXCLUDED CLAIMS NEITHER PARTY NOR ITS SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALL EQUIPMENT\nAND TECHNOLOGY SUPPLIERS), OFFICERS, AFFILIATES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY AMOUNTS THAT, TOGETHER WITH AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OTHER CLAIMS,\nEXCEED THE FEES PAID AND PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER TO COMPANY FOR THE SERVICES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE LIABILITY, IN EACH CASE, WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. “Excluded Claims” means claims or liabilities arising out\nof (a) bodily injury of a person, (b) breaches of the data privacy and confidentiality provisions hereunder, (c) matters that are the subject of indemnification hereunder or (iv) fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or material breach of the agreement provided that claims or liabilities arising out of an Excluded Claim will not exceed $2,000,000.00.\n14. USE OF CONTRACTORS\nIf Company utilizes contractors or subcontractors in the performance of its obligations hereunder,\nCompany agrees that it shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of its contractors and\nsubcontractors in the performance of its obligations hereunder.\n15. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; INSIDER TRADING\nEach party shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Company hereby acknowledges that it is aware, and that it shall advise its employees, contractors and subcontractors who provide services to Customer or any of its affiliates under or in connection with this Agreement, that securities laws, as applicable, may prohibit any person who has\nreceived material, non-public information regarding an issuer (or its subsidiaries or affiliates) from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.\n16. MISCELLANEOUS\nIf any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sub-licensable by either party except with the other party’s prior written consent. Neither party may\ntransfer or assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without the other party’s consent. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all waivers and\nmodifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and Customer does not have any authority of any kind to bind Company in any respect whatsoever. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled\nto recover costs and attorneys’ fees. All notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\n‍"}

Check out these best practices to capture your audience's attention—and hook them from the moment you step on the virtual stage. Here's everything you need to know about planning your webinar, from developing awesome content to driving engagement during the event itself. Let's dive in!\n8 weeks out\nTypes of Webinars for Every Stage of the Customer Journey\nTwo months from your ideal launch date is the best time to kick off your content planning and strategy session. The first thing discussed during your meeting should be what type of webinar you want to host. If you're scratching your head and wondering what your options are, here are 12 types of webinars you can host at every stage of the customer journey.\nHow to Choose a Topic for Your Audience\nSome of the best content comes from listening to your audience. Narrowing down your audience's pain points and needs is the first step to creating great webinar content. Understand what they're hungry to learn and what problems they're trying to solve.\nIf you're unsure what their problems are, conduct small-scale targeted research through polls and surveys by putting your email lists and social channels to good use. (Pro tip: Try LinkedIn's\npolling feature\nto gauge your audience's interests quickly.) You can even narrow your inquiries with event registrants—or ask your audience about a finer point live during the event!\nWorking from a broad topic to a narrow, audience-centered hook is often helpful. For instance, you might start with \"Webinar Best Practices\" and narrow it down to \"Double Your Webinar Conversion Rate!\" That is, as long as you can deliver on that promise. ;)\nTypical broad topics include:\nHow to solve common problems\nInsider industry know-how\nHow to learn a specific skill or understand a relevant new trend\nProduct deep dives\nTips for Choosing an Engaging Speaker\nYou don't want to grab any old speaker for your webinar. You need someone who can engage an audience and provide insights into their industry so they'll be interested in what you have to say!\nResearch\nshows that people form impressions about a speaker's competence in as little as 30 seconds. This means in less than a minute; attendees will decide whether your speaker is trustworthy and judge them based on their body language and vocal attributes.\nLook at these traits before deciding on a potential guest:\nKnowledgeable:\nThis person should know more than enough about the topic and keep up with trends within it.\nDynamic:\nThey should be able to deliver engaging content from the start till finish and add some sparkle where needed, like humor or creativity.\nCredible:\nEnsure this person is credible on the topic they're presenting so that attendees will trust what they're saying.\nConfident:\nThis person should be able to give the appearance of confidence and competence. Making eye contact, keeping an open posture, using gestures to reinforce key points, varying their pace as they speak, and not over-using filler words are just some characteristics of a confident speaker.\nWhile we all want to cultivate partnerships with like-minded brands to nab incredible webinar speakers, don't discount your team's expertise. Sometimes relevance and depth are better than an instantly recognizable name—especially if you have a topic bound to draw in registrants. (Remember the importance of credibility?)\nDevelop Supporting Content\nNurture your webinar leads by offering supporting content to engage with attendees during and after the event. Content could include downloadable assets (like guides) and the next event's invitations sent through email, social channels, or directly within the webinar itself.\n3-4 Weeks Out:\nTarget Your Audience\nWebinars are all about your audience, what they want to learn and how you can help. So make sure the copy in any email outreach or announcement reflects them.\nRemember to target the job titles, companies, or prospects who will benefit most from your content. Keep in mind the more you can personalize your invites with information you already know about them, the better your conversation rate will be.\nFind the Right Email Cadence\nNearly\n60%\nof webinar registrations come from email campaigns, so it's important to get it right. At a minimum, you'll need to send the following:\nA webinar outreach email\nA registration confirmation email\nAn event reminder (or three)\nA \"Thank you\" message\nA follow-up message with the webinar recording and any other assets you've prepared for attendees\nKeep an Eye on Registration Numbers\nTracking your campaign progress is a key part of successfully running a webinar. Understand if you're hitting your registration goals, and keep in mind that 54% of all webinar attendees sign up a week before you go live, so remember that last-minute push!\nIf your numbers are lower than you'd like, shake it up! Tweak your messaging or change your promotional channels. Small changes, like reducing fields on the registration form or asking a brand partner to conduct outreach, can make a big difference in webinar attendance.\nNeed more tips on webinar registration? Check out our article,\n\"How to Boost Registrations and Attendance To Your Webinars,\"\nfor expert ideas.\nPrep Your Speakers\nEnsure your guest speakers are prepped, ready, and comfortable in your\nvirtual green room\n. The more thoroughly speakers understand the run-of-show, the more relaxed and engaging they'll be during your presentation.\nPlanning a webinar? Download our\nFree Webinar Planning Template\nso you don’t miss a thing on your to-do list!\n‍\nHow to Promote a Webinar\nA question that gets asked often is, \"\nHow do I increase registrations to my webinar and get people to show up?\n\"\nHere are five tips to boost your webinar's registration.\nOptimize Your Webinar Registration Form\nOne key element often overlooked is the webinar registration form. It's the gateway to your virtual event, so show it some love. So what makes an optimized registration form?\nKeep it short\n. When it comes to form fields, less is more. According to\nHubSpot\n, the optimal number of fields to have are three. It's a balancing act between business needs and user experience, but gathering the least amount of information possible will reduce drop-off.\nUse smart fields.\nA great feature of marketing automation platforms like HubSpot is\nsmart fields\n. They keep your leads from doing unnecessary work by removing form fields previously submitted by a customer or prospect.\nDesign using a single-column layout\n. A single-column layout has\nbeen proven\nmore effective in driving conversions than multiple columns on the same page. They offer better flow, resulting in better UX.\nOptimize for mobile.\nDon't forget about mobile-friendly design when creating your form. Make form fields and submit buttons finger size (generally 44x44 is the best size). Limit the typing needed by using dropdown menus, radio buttons, auto-selected answers, and easy-to-read fonts.\nUse Quick Registration Links.\nIncluding Welcome's Quick Registration link in your promo emails, invitees can access your webinar via the link provided without filling out another form.\nAdd CTAs to Unexpected Areas\nOn average, up to 57% of webinar registrations come from email. It's a given that you'll add call-to-action buttons to email invites and social posts, but here are several other areas to add CTAs:\nAdd a CTA banner to your website\nLink a CTA to your email signatures\nPromote through your newsletters\nAdd a CTA for your next event during your current webinar\nMake sure to take stock of all your digital assets and think of innovative ways to get your message out.\nBuild a Virtual Events Page\nIf you consistently host webinars and other virtual events, it's important to have a designated events page where visitors can find all upcoming webinars and on-demand videos. Like Welcome's\nevent page\n, yours can serve as a repository for all your future planned events and enable you to capture new signups that may not already be in your marketing database. Better yet, by adding your past events as gated on-demand videos to the events page, you can continue to increase viewership long after the webinar wraps.\nPromote Your Event Up Until Showtime\nIf you want to ensure your webinar has a good turnout, it's critical that you keep promoting in the lead-up. While two weeks is standard practice to begin pre-event promotion, a whopping 29% of people register on the same day as their event. So keep spreading the word across all your marketing channels; fingers crossed, they'll quickly fill up with eager participants!\nAdd Partnerships to Your Webinar Strategy\nWant to take your promotion efforts twofold? Partnering up with like-minded brands will bring you even closer to success. Co-hosting a webinar is the perfect way for both businesses involved - plus, having twice as many people promoting it can boost those registrant numbers. Just ensure that expectations are managed and agreed upon— like who will get which pieces of the registrant list and emails, if a recording is shared in both channels, and when you send out those social media posts. It's best to avoid having surprises pop up to get the most out of each other's time and effort!\n‍\nHow to Boost Your Webinar's Attendance\nHalf the battle is getting people to sign up for your webinar; now, you need them to show up! Here are five tips to boost your webinar attendance.\nHost During Optimal Times and Days\nWhen you're planning a webinar, timing is everything. Aim to host your webinars mid-week and avoid Mondays and Fridays. Thursday reigns supreme as the most popular day for attending virtual events (\n26%\n), followed by Tuesdays (\n23%)\nand Wednesdays (\n21%\n). And when should your event start? Mid-morning seems to be preferred by\n28%\nof viewers, with\n27%\npreferring mid-afternoon – so aim for those time slots between Tuesday and Thursday!\nUse Email Reminders to Keep in Touch\nYou've worked hard to get people signed up for your upcoming webinar - and you don't want it to become a distant memory! Establish an email sequence that subtly reminds attendees of what's coming & why it matters. Don't overwhelm them with too many messages, or you might tempt them to hit unsubscribe; three reminders should do the trick.\nThe complete email cadence can look like this:\nPost-registration follow-up confirmation email\nFirst reminder: Sent 1 week from the webinar\nSecond reminder: Sent 1 day before the webinar\nThird reminder: Sent 1 hour before the webinar\nOn-the-fence reminder: Send your final promotional email on the day of the webinar to people who've opened previous emails but did not register\nFirst follow-up: \"Here's your recording!\"\nSecond follow-up: \"Additional resources\"\nThird follow-up: \"Future events\"\nDon't Forget About On-Demand Recordings\nEven when the curtain drops on your live event, remember those audience members who prefer to consume content at their own pace. People tend to be more engaged and interested in recordings they can watch whenever they like - so seize the opportunity. Not only will you increase headcount overall, but around\n30%\nof signups come from people watching the recorded version. In other words, if you make it available, people will attend.\nIncentivize Attendance\nTry taking some cues from the event world and start gifting to drive attendance. Like you would use swag for trade shows and industry event booths, gifts can also be integrated into virtual events, as evidenced by a 60% attendance rate Lessonly achieved when they sent Starbucks gift cards for a virtual coffee chat.\nEven though giveaways add to your bottom line, sending eGifts can be one of the most impactful things you can do to boost attendance.\nAlways Add Value to Keep Attendees Coming Back\nIt's more than just having the best webinar platform - it takes great content to draw people back in. If you want future visitors, prioritize actionable and educational content that provides valuable insights instead of turning your event into a big sales pitch! Up to 40% of return visitors have been reported by those who offer real value through their presentations – so give them what they need with tips, tricks & best practices galore.\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops!

Check out our list of innovative engagement ideas – guaranteed to have your attendees interacting, energized, and engaged!\nStart Strong From The Get Go\nSet the stage for a successful webinar by kicking off in high gear. Think about it like previews in a movie theatre - wouldn't everyone rather sit down and watch something fun than wait around? Build excitement with virtual games, pre-recorded hype videos, or even pub quizzes on your chosen topic – all designed to get things rolling right away!\nChoose a Stellar Speaker\nYour speaker is key to making your webinar captivating. Of course, they need to offer valuable insights about their trade - but that can only go so far.\nHow\nthey deliver these facts is equally as crucial: body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions must all play into their performance for people to fully engage. Plus, let us not forget those delightful stories of personal journeys sprinkled throughout the presentation; nothing quite warms hearts like an accompanying narrative!\nDitch the Slide Deck\nInstead of presenting run-of-the-mill slides, punch up your presentation with graphic overlays. Forget PowerPoint! Branded graphics are your perfect companion for introducing a new wow factor into virtual events. With overlays, you can keep your presentation content minimal yet super effective while keeping everyone's attention focused on YOU - not endless slides they have to read through (zzzzz).\nPro Tip: Don't have a graphic designer? Don't worry. With a bevy of engagement features and minimal design knowledge required, anyone on your team can create an unforgettable branded event with\nAgenda Builder\nand\nStage Kit\n! Cut down on overwhelm by ditching slides crammed full of text in favor of concise speeches that deliver all the info - no more zoning out for attendees!\nBring Attendees on Stage\nFoster a dynamic dialogue by inviting attendees on stage for Q&A. Instead of answering questions in the traditional one-directional manner, make it more personal with an interactive Q&A session. Get rid of the feeling that attendees are just being talked at by inviting audience members on stage to ask their burning questions face-to-face. Show them you genuinely care about what they take away from the event. After all, connection is key when trying to engage participants!\nMix up the Format\nKeep your audience from running off with their attention spans by switching up the format throughout your webinar. You can include exciting visuals such as videos or polls and get everyone involved through engaging activities like breakout rooms or an on-stage Q&A session. With this much variety at hand, you'll be holding onto the click of interest for hours rather than minutes!\nAs a best practice, avoid speaking for longer than 15 minutes without changing the format slightly.\nCaptivate Through Your Content\nKeep attendees engaged with captivating content that isn't heavy-handed on the sales pitch - let their problems drive you towards highlighting how your product or service provides the best solution instead of pushing it down their throats. Use CTA overlays or the Chat Box to sprinkle in some free resources.\n‍\nHow to Repurpose Webinar Content\nMany companies invest in creating a seemingly endless stream of content — often to little avail. But fret not! Quality will always beat quantity: instead of pushing more and more articles into the interwebs, repurpose your existing events materials; this way, you're guaranteed high-quality output without stretching resources too thin. Here are some creative solutions so that every team—big or small—can make it work.\nCreate Short-Form Content\nWith webinars being a virtual goldmine for rich, power-packed social media content - from video clips to infographics and insights, it's an amazing opportunity to give your brand marketing & outreach efforts the edge.\nWelcome is doing this by creating powerful mini-videos with great visuals that increase our events' engagement and keep all our channels synced up.\nWelcome\n4,384 followers\n2mo\nEdited\nInterested in uniting your sale and marketing teams?

It's like hitting three birds with one stone!\nTurn Audio into a Podcast\nDon't just stick to video content when it comes to your virtual event - audio recordings can also become valuable assets! Turn them into a full podcast episode or short sound clips, and you'll have a low-cost way of engaging with people through sound. Not only that, but you get the chance for even more creative storytelling opportunities too – who said podcasts don't need visuals?!\nBuild an On-Demand Video Library\n30% of event registrants\nprefer to watch webinar content after the live event. For a content marketer, this is an exciting equation. You can support these needs with an on-demand video library of all your event content.\nNot only can you improve your SEO with a landing page for each video, but landing pages with embedded forms or strong CTAs can also\nhelp your sales team capture more leads\n.\nPitch to an Industry Blog\nIt's time to expand your reach! Already an expert on the topic of your webinar? It's pitch-perfect for you to explore additional outlets and become a thought leader. Try pitching relevant opinion pages or industry blogs so that more readers can benefit from your expertise. The potential upside is immense - increased brand awareness, and solidified status as a thought-leader extraordinaire.\nCase Studies, Ebooks, and Other Major Assets\nWith some additional research and content strategy elbow grease, you could create:\nRelated blog content and a pillar page\n. Is your webinar content integral to your business model? Begin to own SEO on a specific search term by creating a\ntopic cluster\nof related blog posts and a longer\npillar page\n. Not only will this increase your organic traffic, but it will also bolster your brand's position as an expert in the space.\nA customer case study\n. Showcase how a customer or client uses your product to solve the challenges from your webinar with a customer case study. Case studies are great bottom-of-the-funnel content and can help boost product demonstration conversions or sales!\nA white paper\n. Dive deeper into the research related to your webinar topic to demonstrate your brand's understanding of related challenges and opportunities in your industry. While white papers are a bigger commitment in terms of time and resources, they can also be incredible assets for capturing leads or closing sales.\nUse event analytics and audience questions to develop new content and event ideas\nNot sure what to write about for your next blog post or your next topic for the upcoming webinar? Let event analytics and audience questions lead you in a new direction. Look at poll responses to understand what's top-of-mind with your viewers, and use that data to create new content or future webinars. On the flip side, look through those same analytics - watching where people are tuning out during live events or video replays. Take this information back in time and make tweaks, so everyone stays intrigued until (and even after) all eyes have left the screen!\nHow to Nurture Leads After a Webinar\nYour webinar was a hit - the chat was fire, and your Live Q&A session was fun and lively! So what do you do next to convert those viewers into motivated buyers? We have some tried-and-true tips for turning qualified leads into sales that enable success across teams.\nEmbed CTAs Into Your Presentation\nTo keep your buyers on the journey, you need to inspire them to act. Drive quality leads straight into sales by enchanting them with engaging webinar content and captivating CTAs. Your virtual event shouldn't just be informative; make sure it moves prospects along in that all-important sales funnel.\nA strong CTA will:\nCreate a sense of scarcity (like a limited-time offer or a two-for-one deal),\nor\nProvide your webinar attendees with something they\nreally\nwant (like your one-of-a-kind spreadsheet template or a product demo that makes their purchasing decision that much easier)\nAnd a great CTA might achieve both goals!\nConduct a Survey Before Attendees Leave\nTake advantage of the momentum and positive engagement by launching a\npost-event survey\nwithin Welcome. Conducting surveys before attendees leave the webinar, gives you valuable insight from your prospects about their buying intent—without having to wait for responses. Use that data to shape a winning strategy for sales success down the line.\nDon't risk attendees skipping over an email in their inbox one week later. Pose your most important questions as attendees head out the door, then integrate your survey responses into your customer relationship management (CRM) software to make demo and sales calls that much easier.\nFollow Up with Additional Content\nYour after-event outreach should be armed with more than just a thank you email—to give prospects an extra nudge towards conversion, include sales enabling assets too. From product feature breakdowns to checklists and templates, having marketing materials on hand can help start conversations between leads and your sales team for easier engagement down the line. Don't forget to share which files are being accessed so your sales team is in the loop and has an easy conversation starter with the prospect.\nMaximize Sales Conversations with CRM Integrations\nGive your sales team the perfect head start with integrations that capture attendee engagement, such as Q&A questions, polls they respond to, any assets they downloaded during the event, if they filled out a demo form, and other sales indicators. Your reps won't need fly-by introductions when hopping into calls; they'll be able to pick up a conversation right where your lead left off.\nCreate a Nurture Campaign\nNot all of your attendees are necessarily ready to take the plunge and book that product demo or commit to buying. To keep them interested until they're ready for more, provide helpful tips & tricks, engaging educational content, customer reviews, and case studies.\nWith an integrated CRM you'll have extensive insights into what drives engagement among attendees, so use those details to send more targeted content in your nurture campaign.\nWhether you send free assets or encourage leads to sign up for additional webinars, don't discount the power of a nurture campaign to build trust and confidence in your brand—and set your sales team up for future success.\nHow to Measure ROI of a Webinar\nIf measuring webinar ROI is challenging for your team, you're not alone.\n64% of B2B marketers\nsay their ability to demonstrate the value of their content marketing efforts is only average—or worse. You've put in a ton of hard work and dedication to ensure your webinars are well-attended, but it can still be challenging to prove their ROI without a solid foundation for analysis. By monitoring the right metrics, you'll have enough data evidence to show just how valuable these events are. From measuring lead quality, and attributing sales back to your efforts - getting those real returns won't seem like so much smoke and mirrors.\nHere are the four strategies you should implement to demonstrate the ROI of your webinars and virtual events:\nTrack the Source of Registrations\nIdentifying the channels that effectively bring in registrants for webinars is crucial to ensuring your marketing dollars are well-spent.\nUTM tracking codes\nare snippets of code in URLs that track which channel was the most effective in reaching—and converting—webinar registrants. With a bit of tracking-code sleuthing, you can find out exactly where your money was put best and plan accordingly. Make sure no URLs slip through the cracks so these cleverly crafted snippets do their job right!\nHosting a webinar comes with budget considerations, and no matter what size operation you're running, it's important to ensure every dollar is accounted for. Expenses can include:\nAdvertising costs, like paid ads or media.\nBoosting a Facebook post\nRunning a LinkedIn campaign\nSponsoring a blog post on a partner's website\nProduction costs also add up quickly. Here are a few to consider:\nDid you hire a graphic designer to make flawless slides?\nA video editor to help with post-production for on-demand services?\nEngage a production agency to help you manage run-of-show?\nThankfully,\nWelcome\ncan consolidate production costs. With in-platform tools for designing, editing, and hosting virtual events, we offer B2B marketers one way to save $$$ —and boost their ROI for every event.\nDetermine Lead Quality\nOne of the benefits of holding webinars is\ngenerating qualified leads\n. As soon as a lead registers for your event, you receive key details, including where they work or their role at a specific company. Depending on your webinar content, you'll also know where they are in their\ncustomer journey\n.\nAdditional metrics help to determine the overall quality of the leads generated from each webinar. These metrics include:\nEngagement\n.\nHow engaged was your lead\nin responding to polls during the webinar? Did they ask a question during Live Q&A? Are they still opening and clicking on your promotional emails now that the webinar is over? And, most importantly, did they click on your call-to-action at the end of the event?\nContent assets downloaded.\nDownloading assets would typically be considered a \"soft\" KPI. But this is still integral information for your sales team to have—and for you to assess the success of any content supporting your webinar topic. You may even wish to assign more lead score points for downloading a \"high intent\" piece of content, like a comparison or pricing sheet.\nDemo requests.\nHow many leads requested a product demo after attending your webinar?\nMeetings booked.\nHow many leads requested a sales call or meeting after attending your webinar?\nOverall lead score.\nWhile every company generates\nlead scores\ndifferently, all the actions a lead takes before, during, and after a webinar can help you determine where they fall in the buyer's journey and how likely they are to become a customer. How many high-scoring leads does each of your webinars generate?\nThe more qualified leads you hand over to the sales team, the more valuable your event content is.\nSales and Revenue Attribution\nYou can see exactly how your event impacted the deal cycle with proper tracking.\nThrough the Welcome/Salesforce integration, you can see how your attendees are moving through the funnel post-event. To do this, track the following\nNet new pipeline from every virtual event\nThe number of closed-won opportunities from each webinar\nAnd the total amount of closed-won revenue generated by your webinars\nWith data like this, you'll never scramble to prove webinar ROI again!\nExperience\nWelcome\nA webinar platform designed for marketers to host jaw-dropping experiences that drive revenue.\nRequest a demo"}

Even more difficult, is enforcing brand consistency since most employees aren’t designers.\nBrand guidelines make sure that anyone creating content for your business will stay on-brand. This means colors and logos all look the same. However, we know that even if an organization has brand guidelines to adhere to, it can still take a considerable amount of time and design resources to brand all your events within a virtual event platform.\nThat is until we released this evolution of stage kit! We’re helping the bottleneck in the content creation process by allowing users to easily brand their live events with pre-made elements, layouts, name tags, and backgrounds (animated and static).\nWhat makes this so special?\n‍\nIt’s on-brand.\nThis one is a bit self-explanatory, but your whole organization can maintain brand consistency easily without putting in the extra effort. Every background, countdown, transition, and name tag will have your brand colors. Automatically.\n‍\nIt’s resourceful.\nIt saves time & design resources by using branded assets already built within the Welcome Platform.\n‍\nIt’s simple.\nPre-made design elements allow you to spin up professional-looking events quickly.\n‍\nIt’s non-designer friendly.\nIt allows everyone in the organization, not just designers, to create beautiful on-brand events with ease.\nThe Details\n‍\nBranded Name Tags\nDo name tags matter? Of course! Adding graphics to your live stream adds a certain level of polish and professionalism to your content. Name tags introducing your speakers or lower-thirds providing information for what’s happening on-screen is crucial for context-setting. Welcome now auto-populates name tags with your brand colors, so when your speakers hit the stage, they’re name is immediately displayed.\n‍\n‍\nBranded Q&A Prompts\nThe ability for the audience to ask questions throughout the event or meeting is an expected feature and one that most virtual event platforms have. However, Welcome takes a unique approach and offers a more personal experience that closely emulates an in-person question and answer exchange where attendees can be brought on-stage to ask questions. Stage Kit 2.0 now takes Q&A a step further by offering branded Q&A prompts that display the audience’s questions in your brand colors and templated background.\n‍\n‍\nBranded Animated & Static Backgrounds\nAnother way to get a consistent brand look is to standardize the background behind your speakers. The updated Stage Kit includes animated and static backgrounds that use your brand’s primary colors. Now, you can select from a variety of different options that will be automatically displayed during your event.\n‍\nBranded Countdown Clocks\nLetting the audience know exactly when the event will start and when the next session will begin are two situations where a session timer comes in handy. Use the branded timers to set countdown times and easily drop them into the run-of-show to give the audience a heads up on when your event will begin or create buffers between sessions.\nOr use them as transitions between sessions or at the end of your event.\nGet Started with Stage Kit 2.0\nIf you’re a Welcome customer you can start auto-branding your virtual events and meetings today.

Research by the Boston Consulting Group found that out of 22 HR practices, onboarding has the 2nd highest impact on employee engagement. But, with employees swapping the company office for the home office, how do you still ensure a great onboarding experience in a remote-first workplace?\nRemote Onboarding\nIn the largest work-from-home experiment the world has ever seen, onboarding new hires remotely have its challenges. From making new employees feel comfortable to building an understanding of the culture and how work gets done, connecting at a human level can be difficult. To foster more human connection, HR and People leaders can create touch points throughout the onboarding journey, helping set up your new hires for success.\n1. Employee Orientation\nWith so many workers starting jobs remotely, logging in on the first day and struggling to navigate a new workplace without the benefits of meeting coworkers in person can feel isolating. If done well, employee orientation can still help new hires feel welcome and help them understand your company culture. Icebreakers and intros are a great way to welcome employees and allow your recruits to get to know each other informally.\n💡\nEmployee Onboarding Tip:\nVirtual icebreakers like asking new hires to share a photo of their family or pets or using\npolls\nfor Two Truths and a Lie can help lighten the mood and encourage bonding right from the start.\nHighlighting your\ncompany culture\nand how work gets done is one of the most important sessions of orientation. New hires tend to bring their values and beliefs with them, as well as values learned from previous workplaces, so being clear on company culture on Day 1 will help ensure cultural alignment.\nEvery company’s orientation will look a little different, but one element every orientation should have is the interaction between the speakers and attendees. A good balance between lecture-style sessions and interactive sessions will help keep the attention of all the attendees. Ensuring new hires can ask questions throughout each session is one way to do this.\n💡\nEmployee Onboarding Tip:\nBring new hires on stage for face-to-face Q&A or turn on anonymous Q&A to give new hires the ability to ask questions openly, without the fear of repercussions, embarrassment, or ridicule.\n‍\n2. Product Demo\nAll new employees, from BDRs to marketing managers, have to be trained on your product to do their jobs well. It should include a deep explanation of the product, starting with its history, and how pricing works and ending with a deep dive into what the product does. Ensuring alignment on what your products are, how you make money, and why the company exists will help decrease the new hire's time to impact. Think about it like this – at the end of the demo, they should be able to explain what the company does to their parents.\n💡\nEmployee Onboarding Tip:\nDon’t just rely on the onboarding team to host all the onboarding events, bring in a product manager to deliver more product-specific training. This also allows new hires to meet more colleagues whom they may not typically interact with.\n‍\n3. Virtual Meet and Greets\nBefore getting new hires ramped on projects, get the new employee to focus more on relationship building. Strong coworker relationships are critical for creating connections and a sense of belonging. People are no longer casually bumping into each other by the watercooler, so dedicated time for new hires to connect with coworkers on their team or cross-functionally should be set aside.\n💡\nEmployee Onboarding Tip: Finding common ground is the quickest way to foster connection.\nUse breakout sessions to match people according to their locations or shared interests.\nYou can also help employees connect by\nhosting employee events\n. Celebrating your new hires by hosting virtual cooking classes or virtual happy hours gives them the opportunity to bond over new cooking or mixology skills. They can use Q&A to ask the chef or bartender questions and jump over to the lounge room to share a meal or cocktail.\n‍\n4. Virtual Session with the CEO\nSet up a virtual meeting with the CEO a few weeks into the onboarding journey. Use it as a forum for them to get to know each other and for the CEO to reiterate company culture and values. Hosting the event a few weeks into onboarding gives employees time to marinate on all the information learned during orientation. Therefore, the CEO should be instilling purpose, reiterating the values and company goals, and sharing their personal stories behind what they do and why.\n💡\nEmployee Onboarding Tip:\nMake the session with the CEO feel informal and host a coffee & chat. Email Starbucks gift cards in advance and invite them to grab a cup of joe before the meeting begins.\n‍\n5. Announce New Hires in Your All-Hands Meetings\nYour new hires have the chance to meet their managers and teammates early on, but most of the company may not know who they are unless you make an official announcement. Announcing and celebrating new hires to the entire organization can be done in an\nall-hands or town hall meeting\n. Jump-start the bonding process by giving the whole company a sneak peek into their new coworkers’ personalities and interests.\n‍\nFinal Thoughts\nIt’s stated that 86% of people make the decision to stay with a company long-term within the first six months [Aberdeen Group]. HR and people leaders have a short amount of time to create an overall positive impact on new employees. By creating several touch points throughout the 30-60-90 day onboarding process like the ones listed above, new employees will feel more included and part of the company from Day 1.\n‍\nWelcome\nis employee event software designed to support your employee lifecycle.\nOnboard and engage new hires\n, gather the company for an\nall-hands meeting\n, or support employee coaching needs, all in one, highly energizing platform.\nStart designing a better company culture for your team today.

But since everything changed, marketers have switched their attention to getting their money’s worth out of virtual events—taking full advantage of the advanced analytics and reporting capabilities many platforms now boast.\nUnfortunately, this hasn’t always translated into a great experience for participants. Many virtual events are bland, uninspiring, and do little to combat a growing sense of screen fatigue. The problem? Virtual events simply aren’t meeting attendees’ needs. Or worse, they put marketers’ needs for attribution and lead-scoring ahead of creating a great experience.\nI don’t blame marketers. For many, virtual events are still relatively new (or newly prioritized). I think it comes down to a lack of understanding of what makes a compelling virtual experience—which is different, though related, to a great in-person event.\nSo what do your guests need in order to have a meaningful and memorable virtual event experience? It all comes down to Maslow’s hierarchy of virtual event attendee needs.\nMaslow’s hierarchy of virtual event attendee needs\nA quick refresher:\nMaslow’s Hierarchy of Needs\nis a motivational theory, depicting human needs as a hierarchical framework (often illustrated as a pyramid). The theory goes that you have to satisfy baseline needs before attending to higher-order requirements. For example, a person needs food before they can worry about friendship.\nIt’s also a useful model for virtual events. Your guests have foundational needs that must be met before more sophisticated albeit marketable ones, like “connection.” It’s only by starting from the ground up that you ever fulfill their higher-order needs.\nWhat are these needs, you may ask? There are six to consider. They fall into three categories—basic, psychological, and self-fulfillment.\nMaslow’s hierarchy of virtual event attendee needs\nWhat does this framework mean for you? Well, the reason people might not be loving your virtual events (sorry, I said it) is that you aren’t meeting their needs in the right order.\n1. Structure\nIf you find attendees drop out of your event or don’t stay until the end, it may be because you lack structure. Events that lack structure give people anxiety and make them less likely to interact or engage. If there’s no clear agenda and your attendees feel uncertain about where your event is going, what’s to stop them from clicking away? The reverse is also true: Having structure puts your attendees at ease, allowing them to relax and enjoy.\nTo provide structure and allow your attendees to immerse themselves in your event, you need to tell them what to expect, remind them of the plan, and actually follow through. Give attendees a very clear sense of what will happen and when it will all end. And don't just drop it in the invite email—make it constantly available, so people feel oriented at all times.\nI recommend following this run-of-show (which you can modify based on your needs) to help you stay organized and provide your audience with a sense of structure.\nExample run of show\nAt the beginning of your event, be sure to walk your participants through the run-of-show so they know what to expect. Better yet, send the agenda ahead of time or pin it in the chat so your audience can follow along.\nChecklist: Build structure into your event\nShare your agenda with attendees\nAt each stage, remind them what's next\nStart and stop in a timely manner\n2. Guidance\nIf your events have a tendency to descend into anarchy, a lack of guidance may be to blame. Many hosts are hesitant to enforce their authority on an event, but it’s important to understand that limitations are actually a gift for your attendees. In the absence of rules, people start unmuting themselves and talking over one another. In contrast, when your participants know the rules of engagement, it provides a basis for harmony in behavior and reduces the social anxiety of not knowing how to act.\nTell your guests exactly what to do to get the most out of your event. Share your house rules at the outset of the event (and make sure to enforce them). And don’t forget to orient your guests in the virtual environment—for example, where can they find the chat, submit a question for Q&A, and navigate to a breakout room for networking after the talk?\nContinually prepare your guests for what’s coming up next and provide them with direction to get the most out of the event. For instance, if you'll be taking questions, announce the Q&A periodically to get people warmed up and thinking about what they want to ask. Or if there's a break for networking, tell people to come away with three new people’s emails. Make it fun and lighthearted.\nChecklist: Guide your guests effectively\nShare house rules and enforce them\nOrient your guests in the virtual environment\nProvide guidance on how to get the most out of the event\n3. Unique Value\nIf you get a lot of registrations, but those registrations don’t turn into actual attendees, you may not have articulated your unique value clearly enough. Your unique value is your guest’s reason for attending your event. Without it, your audience may face the day-of dilemma: If they don’t see a compelling reason to attend your event live, they may fall prey to their burgeoning to-do list and skip.\nYou need to show your audience that you’re giving them the opportunity to learn or experience something very specific they can’t get anywhere else. This is your “only-ness” factor—the thing that\nonly you\ncan provide. Maybe it’s the chance to ask a question of one of their heroes. Or maybe it’s the opportunity to learn a skill that will help them in their career. Or maybe it’s the opportunity to experience something unique. For instance,\nBrooks Wine\nruns virtual tasting sessions hosted by artisan producers—allowing foodies to try delicious food and wine under the guidance of an expert. Whatever your event’s focus, show your audience that it’s time well spent.\nChecklist: Make your event time well spent\nCenter your event around a uniquely valuable experience\nClearly articulate the reason your guests should attend\nRespect your participants’ time by making your event only as long as it needs to be\n4. Engagement\nDo people attend your events, but nobody really participates? Consider building in more opportunities for engagement. With screen fatigue at an all-time high, it’s critical to consider not just\nwhat\nyou’re presenting, but also\nhow\nyou’re delivering your content. Use a visually appealing format to help your audience digest your content—think visuals, overlays, and video footage. Incorporate interactive activities, like practice exercises, games, or even a group stretch. If it’s going to be a long session, give your attendees a break part way through.\nYour attendees will thank you for it. Private equity firm Hg achieved their all-time\nhighest NPS score\nat a recent virtual HR & Talent Summit by incorporating a hands-on activity. They mailed terrarium-building kits to attendees all over the world for a live workshop, which fed back into the conference’s theme of wellbeing and self-care. But if you decide to include an interactive component, make sure it’s serving your purpose. “You can't just do an interactive event to be interactive,” says Jessica Greenhalgh, Head of Community & Portfolio Engagement at Hg. “You have to relate it back to the content and format of the day.”\nChecklist: Create an engaging experience\nUse visuals, videos, and overlays to illustrate your messaging\nIncorporate interactivity into your content\nTie activities back to your key lessons or takeaways\n5. Connection\nIf your networking events feel forced, you may need to work on your facilitation. Humans have a core need for connection—in the original Maslow’s hierarchy, two out of the five needs deal directly with human relationships (esteem and belonging). Yet it can be challenging to replicate in-person connections over digital space.\nMy number one tip: Don’t leave moments of connection up to chance. You need to be intentional about how you’re going to facilitate them—much more so than in a physical event where people are free to mingle. For instance, you might start your event with networking (before your feature presentation), so your attendees have a chance to get to know each other. You may also want to open multiple virtual breakout rooms with different topics so people can gravitate to the conversations that most interest them. Ideally, have at least one “host” from your team in each breakout room who can get the conversation going and make everyone feel comfortable.\nTo prevent screen fatigue and help your attendees save their energy for these key moments of connection, have them only turn their cameras on when it comes time for them to interact.\nResearch\nshows the stress of being on camera can drastically deplete people’s energy and contribute to screen fatigue. If your participants are simply watching a presentation, allow them to sit back and enjoy the show. When the time comes for them to participate, you can then encourage them to turn their cameras on.\nChecklist: Cultivate moments of meaningful connection\nStart your event with networking\nStation a host in each breakout room to warm up the conversation\nMinimize on-camera time to reduce screen fatigue and keep your participants fresh\n6. Purpose\nIf you’ve made it to these heights, there likely aren’t any glaring issues with your virtual events. They’re probably engaging, informative, and fun—the kinds of events people love to return to. Still, imbuing your events with purpose can take them from memorable to\nmeaningful\n. If you’re thinking at this level, you’ve unlocked all that's good in branding and event marketing. You’re helping people self-actualize.\nTo create an experience that’s truly meaningful, your event should let your participants connect to a higher purpose. But what does this look like? First, it’s important to understand the difference between the outward purpose of your event and its higher purpose. For instance, imagine a virtual conference. The surface-level purpose of the event is education and networking—attendees come to learn and network with their peers.\nIts higher purpose, on the other hand, takes a\nstance.\nIt’s disputable, as Priya Parker puts it in\nThe Art of Gathering\n. Some examples of a higher purpose for our hypothetical virtual conference could be:\nTo promote creative thinking in our industry\nTo foster relationships between people facing similar challenges\nTo break down the barriers between traditionally siloed fields\nThe more defined your purpose, the easier it will be to make the right decisions for your event. This also ties into the idea of making meaningful connections—your attendees will find connection with the people they share a purpose with. Having a higher purpose elevates your event from being simply mechanical to being transcendent. Your attendees will experience your event on a different level if they feel they are a part of something bigger than themselves.\nConnect your event to a higher purpose:\nChoose a distinct, disputable purpose for your event\nConsider: How will you facilitate connection between people who share the same purpose? (See “Connection” for ideas)\nDecide what’s the single most important thing for attendees to take away from your event—and make sure you repeat and reinforce it often\nFinal thoughts\nSwitching to a primarily virtual event landscape has been a big change for marketers, but also for participants. While marketers have sometimes struggled to meet attendees’ needs in the virtual space, virtual events have the same opportunity as in-person to fulfill some of our deepest human needs—it’s just a question of adjusting tactics to fit this new way of gathering. When you consider your attendees’ needs first, you’re well on your way to hosting an event that’s not just memorable, but meaningful. And if you tend to your participants’ needs, results will follow.\nAbout Welcome\nFrom our interactive polling feature to our state-of-the-art production studio, each of Welcome’s features add up to provide a truly exceptional virtual experience platform.

According to the\nAmerican Psychological Association\n, 71% of workers reported experiencing severe work-related stress. And 59% of those employees said they struggled with symptoms like emotional exhaustion, physical fatigue, and lack of motivation at work.\nWhen it comes to feeling stressed at work, people leaders have an additional challenge and responsibility. Not only do we have to be able to recognize burnout in ourselves, but we also have to recognize burnout in our team members.\n‍\n“Burnout and stress is so unique to each individual,”\nsaid\nBrittany Daunno\n, Head of Recruiting Operations at\nBrex\n.\n“What I've noticed with my personal team is I understand what their normal behaviors are, and I understand when things are starting to fall off a little bit.”\n‍\nIn our recent event,\nAsk Me Anything: Tangible Expert Tips to Prevent Burnout\n, Duanno joined her colleague\nVicki Yang\n, VP of People Operations at Brex, and\nWelcome\n’s Co-Founder and CEO,\nRoberto Ortiz\n, to discuss how they recognize burnout in themselves—and work to prevent burnout on their teams.\nWatch the full event\nhere\nfor more expert tips on preventing employee burnout.\nHow to Ask Tough Questions About Burnout\nIn order to understand the root causes of burnout, sometimes managers have to ask employees uncomfortable questions. From a high-level view, that might look like anticipating individual reactions to stress and overwork.\n‍\n“It’s a good exercise for yourself and your team to write down the responses you have to stress. What does that look like? Because I don't think we sit down and really think about it until it's almost too late,”\nsaid Yang.\n“Don't be afraid to ask the question.”\n‍\nFor Daunno, the need to ask tough questions recently became even more specific. When she noticed a detail-oriented employee’s attention to work slipping, she decided to leap head-first into an uncomfortable question.\n“I asked her flat-out ‘Are you happy here? I just wanted to check in and see how things were going,’”\nDaunno recalled.\n“Hearing her out, I realized she's not taken a vacation day for months, and it was my fault for not recognizing that.”\n‍\nDaunno worked with her employee to schedule time off and re-balance her workload.\n“She took five days off, went to Coachella, had a great time, and came back fully recharged,”\nsaid Daunno.\n“It’s like seeing a completely different person.”\n‍\nPreventing Employee Burnout by Re-Thinking Meetings\nWe may have more flexibility in our work days, but the “work anywhere, any time” mentality can get your team into trouble, too. When it comes down to it, preventing employee burnout is about setting–and maintaining–healthy boundaries around your calendar.\nFor leaders like Ortiz, that means prioritizing individual calendars and setting meetings with intention.\n“When we kicked off this quarter, I [asked] my staff to look at the calendar because the calendar ends up defining everything we do, whether we like it or not. Once that invite is sent, there's people waiting for you on the other side of that Zoom link,”\nOrtiz said. Ultimately, considering whether a different form of communication might work more effectively than a meeting\n“helps you prioritize meetings that actually matter\n,\n”\nOritz added.\nAt Brex, there are even more creative solutions on the table. Daunno and other team members can declare\n“meeting bankruptcy”\nin order to offload meetings that aren’t necessary and schedule more time for self-care.\nAs Yang pointed out, managers must be willing to have conversations about meeting overload for these types of policies to work. It’s not always comfortable for employees to bring these challenges to their manager’s attention. That means it’s up to managers to hold time and space for their team to address scheduling needs or to find solutions for overwork.\nShut It Down: The Real Costs of Employee Burnout\nSometimes all the scheduling hacks in the world aren’t enough to offset burnout. If you’re doing your best to help your team prioritize and rebalance their work loads, it’s time to introduce more sustainable, structural solutions.\nAt both Brex and at Welcome, this looks like investing in paid time off and company-wide breaks. Welcome has three-day weekends once a month. Brex introduced “decompression days,” as well as two-week breaks at the Christmas and Fourth of July holidays. After all, if everyone logs off at the same time, no one has to worry about catching up on emails or project updates because they stepped away while their team kept working.\nIf you’re having difficulty pitching big solutions like paid time off or company-wide breaks to your higher ups, it’s important to remind leaders that burnout has a tremendous cost.\n“Mental health platforms like Spring Health and Modern Health all have data around what the cost of burnout is,”\nsaid Yang.\n“There's a cost to turnover.”\n‍\nFinal Thoughts\nDon’t wait until it’s too late to address employee burnout. Find out more about how your team responds to stress, so you can make a plan. You can even use Welcome’s\nemployee event platform\nto take real-time polls about energy levels, scheduling needs, and other pain points.\nWhether you schedule a company-wide day off from meetings or introduce\nmonthly wellness experiences\n, there are many strategies you can use to support your team. No matter how busy you are, taking care of your employees saves you time and money in the long run—and\nimproves the employee experience\nfor everyone.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/prevent-employee-burnout\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

Cancel Your All-Hands Meeting\nSurprise! Sometimes the best thing you can do to support your employees’ mental and emotional health is to give them a little breathing room.\nAt\nWelcome\n, we take the first Friday of every month off. Canceling our\nall-hands meeting\ngives our entire team more time to rest, recuperate, and connect with loved ones. That way, they can come back recharged, refreshed, and excited to get back to work on Monday.\nAfter all, it’s no secret that remote and hybrid teams are out-performing their in-office peers, and that\nmore flexibility increases productivity\n. But with remote work comes an influx of\nemails, meetings, and work-about-work\n. If your leadership team doesn’t work to course correct, this will lead to burnout in a flash.\nSo reward your team with an extra day to recuperate. Which meetings can you cancel? Which days can the entire company use to prioritize wellness? You can always use your next all-hands meeting to survey your team and find out.\n2. Give Everyone a Chance to Reset\nAt\nThrive Global\n, Arianna Huffington’s culture change company, leadership pioneered a data-backed stress management technique called a “Reset.” According to Thrive, 60 to 90-second breaks reduce anxiety and stress.\nThe magic of a “Reset,” though, is in how you use those 90 seconds: looking at pictures of friends and family, reading inspirational quotes, or vibing with your personal mood board. All new hires at Thrive are given these tools during their\nonboarding sessions\n, so they can support their wellbeing as needed.\nIt’s important for managers to support their reports and give them tools to manage stress. Whether you introduce Resets during your next\nall-hands meeting\n, or use part of the all-hands to review practical tips for relieving stress, respecting your team’s need for wellbeing is crucial to improving employee experience.\n3. Be Transparent\nThe burden of wellbeing can’t fall solely on your team. According to MIT, a toxic workplace culture makes it\n10x more likely for employees to leave\n. This means team members more often experience stress because they’re being poorly managed—not because they’re bad at taking care of themselves.\nAnd that should come as no surprise. Most managers have little experience when they move into the role, and they require\nmore coaching\nto succeed. Address plans for your management training publicly.\nAll-hands meetings\nare a great opportunity to practice this level of transparency. Questions you may wish to address include:\nWhat kind of training or coaching will you use?\nWhat’s the timeline?\nWhat can employees expect to see or do differently?\nHow will leadership keep managers accountable?\nWhat role do workers have in accountability structures?\nYou can even use\nsurvey\nfeatures, like the one in\nWelcome\n, to take the temperature of your team and track EQ scores around management or wellness efforts. Don’t forget to share the results of your surveys, or your EQ scores, for extra accountability.\n4. Socialize\nWe tend to think of\nall-hands meetings\nas more work: a time to review goals, ask questions, and align on priorities and purpose. But these meetings can be so much more!\nEmployees crave social interaction, especially when they work in a distributed team. And finding ways to gather your team for conversation will do wonders for building trust and boosting collaboration in the future.\nUse your\nall-hands meeting\nas a social opportunity—not just a business one. Open up your lounge rooms for individual teams, affinity groups, or work buds. Or, take 15 minutes to randomly partner up attendees for meet-and-greets, so you can begin breaking down silos in your company.\nThe more social interaction you introduce into your all-hands, the more connected your team will feel—and the better your company’s employee experience will be.\n5. Volunteer Together\nNow more than ever, employees are looking for\npurpose-driven work\n. They want to know that their values align with the values of their company, and that their job is making a difference in the world.\nWhat better way to enact your company values than to volunteer? Instead of an\nall-hands meeting\n, consider using the time to support an organization that shares your company’s values. (Believe it or not, there are plenty of great\nvirtual volunteering experiences\nout there, too!)\nVolunteering builds teamwork and collaboration skills, while reflecting the values and purpose of your organization. It’s a win-win.\nFinal Thoughts\nWhen it comes to employee retention, productivity, and overall experience, wellbeing matters. And because all-hands meetings are your company’s biggest platform for introducing new strategies, piloting programming, and tracking EQ scores, it’s an important event to springboard your wellness initiatives.\nWelcome\nis employee event software designed to support your employee lifecycle. Survey your team about their biggest wellness challenges, be transparent about your progress toward building a better employee experience, and track improvement over time—all from within an\nall-hands meeting\npowered by Welcome.\nFind out how Welcome can help you transform your company culture by booking a demo today!\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/support-employee-wellbeing-during-all-hands-meeting\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

We also yearn for more meaningful interactions with our colleagues and bosses. And if we can't find it in our current roles, many of us are willing to look elsewhere.\n“McKinsey published a\nstudy\nin September about the Great Resignation and one of the biggest reasons why people are leaving their jobs is because they don’t have a sense of belonging,” said Suman Siva, the co-founder and CEO of\nMarco Experiences\n.\n‍\n“Investing in creating that sense of belonging actually creates business results,”\nhe added. “People talk about events and experiences, which is what we’re doing now, and it can be a band-aid, just something that you need to do. Approaching it with a different mindset and saying, ‘How do I actually foster a connection?’ while still maintaining strong business results is super important.”\nAs Siva suggested,\nvirtual experiences\nare just one tool you can use to build more lasting connections with your team. In our recent event,\nVirtual Safari: Creative Ways to Engage Remote Teams\n, Siva joined Erin Hinson, Engineering Manager at\nBonusly\n, and\nWelcome\n’s Head of Marketing, Jena Andres, to discuss creative ways to engage remote teams.\nWatch the full event\nhere\nfor more tips and tricks to build connection in your remote team.\nCreating Time and Space for Authentic team-building Activities\nOver the next year of hybrid work, people leaders will need new tactics to move beyond transactional team-building, overcome virtual burn out, and\ncreate a culture of belonging\n. The best\nvirtual team-building activities\ndo just that. Not only will they help your team members get to know one another better, but they will also help everyone learn the working and communication styles of their colleagues.\nFor Hinson, these kinds of authentic connections can only be built from a solid foundation. At Bonusly, for example, Hinson asked each member of her team to create an “About Me” page that detailed their background and communication preferences. She created one, too. Hinson also asked her team to respond to the\nCliftonStrengths Finder\n, which she called “the first thing I did that helped the most.”\n“We all talked about what we were good at and…what the team was good at collectively,” Hinson added. “We have a cross-functional team, so our team includes members of design and product. The engineers were very analytical and our design and product partners had great relational strengths, so that balanced the team out.”\nAs Hinson indicated, team-building is only possible when people leaders make time for connection. This is especially true if your team is already stretched to the limit. While this may seem counterintuitive, overloaded teams need\nmore\nsympathy from and for their coworkers. Without a solid foundation of mutual understanding, the stress of over-work will make it harder to understand one another—and get work done.\nThat’s why Siva tries to stay proactive. “We create a culture calendar. Instead of being reactive, we create a way for folks to look forward to meeting,” he said. “We talk a lot about the intentionality of experiences. Experiences can be fun, but they can also be meaningful and really provide an opportunity to get to know one another and do our best work.”\nWhether you play Mario Kart together, like Hinson’s team at Bonusly, or experiment with a virtual company cafe, like Welcome, the fun should be in service of forging real connections.  “We can have amazing safaris, happy hours, and all these things,” said Andres\n, “but at the end of the day, if we’re not feeling that connection and deeper understanding of one another, then those things aren’t as meaningful.”\n‍\nWhen team-building and Boundaries Go Hand in Hand\nBuilding authentic relationships with your virtual team is especially difficult right now, when employees are stretched thin. The pandemic, family responsibilities, and rising prices have all put extra pressure on everyone.\nTo create more space for connection, sometimes it’s better just to get all those stressors out in the open. “We’re living in a world that’s been pretty crazy for the past two years,” said Siva. “Even now, when there’s another outbreak of COVID or a geopolitical crisis, acknowledging the stress that people are going through and allowing for a space to talk about mental health is impactful and allows people to open up.”\nWhether you schedule a\nvirtual experience\n, like guided meditation, or a one-on-one to create that space, your employees will only benefit from a human-centric approach to work.\nThis means it’s on managers to be more mindful of the\nemployee experience\n. For Hinson, that looks like modeling positive approaches to work-life balance. “I try not to work late and to get all my work done within business hours,” said Hinson. “If I do work afterwards, I don’t ping my team on Slack. I schedule messages or save it for tomorrow,” she added.\nSiva agreed. “There are blurred lines between personal and professional life because everyone’s working all the time and can just hop on a Zoom call. Respecting boundaries is super important.”\nMindfulness from managers also benefits introverted employees who want to be included in company culture but who may not shine as brightly as extroverts in social settings. “I have a team of introverts,” said Hinson with a laugh. “Creating a space where people can talk to each other and be as open as they want to be, where we can work as a team together” gives everyone a chance to connect.\nFinal Thoughts\nFrom virtual safaris to company cafes, making more time for authentic connection requires new commitments and intention from people leaders. The good news? You get out what you put in. For every hour your team invests in more meaningful\nvirtual team-building activities\n, the better your employees will be at communicating their preferences and solving creative problems together. Plus, you might even get to spot a flamingo or a giraffe along the way!\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/virtual-safari-remote-team-engagement\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

Having completed a morning of back-to-back Zoom meetings, they’ve only got 5 minutes to refill their coffee cup and respond to lingering Slack messages before settling back in their seat. Just in time for\nyet\nanother virtual happening. In this case, a webinar they’d forgotten they’d signed up for weeks ago. Or maybe it’s the stale company all-hands meeting that occurs every seven days without fail.\nIn an ideal world, you’d have your attendee’s full and undivided attention: eyes directed straight toward the screen, ears absorbing every single word with vested interest. But more realistically, they might be toggling between tabs or mindlessly checking their LinkedIn notifications while checking back on the event from time to time. Zoom fatigue is real, after all. So what can you do to keep your attendee engaged?\nA virtual gathering with zero interaction is a recipe for disaster—no different from an in-person event. After pouring countless hours into planning the heck out of your event and doing the hard work of getting your attendees there, it’s your job, now, to hold their attention. We’ve got a few ideas for how you can do just that. Here are some exercises you can use to inject energy during the right moments, depending on the kind of event you’re hosting.\nAll-hands & team meetings: Bring people closer together\nThere’s a reason why so many companies host regular employee-wide gatherings, commonly known as \"all-hands\" or \"town halls.\" Even if every possible update could be distilled into a single email blast, there’s nothing quite like hearing directly from folks across the team to create a greater sense of connection to the company and mission. Turning your all-hands into an event that employees actually look forward to, however, requires a bit of extra thought and magic. Here are some of the activities we’ve done in our own weekly all-hands to shake things up.\nTry these activities:\nWhose [blank] is this?\n— This one requires a bit of preparation before-hand. Before the meeting, ask team members to send you a picture of their work setup. Then pull the photos up on-screen and take turns guessing which workspace belongs to who. You could do the same thing with baby photos, pictures of pets, or even snapshots of your lunch.\nNew hire intros —\nHave each new hire prep an answer to a fun question (e.g. “if you could have dinner with anyone dead or alive, who would it be and why?”), then bring them on stage during all-hands to share their response. If you’re at a larger company, ask new employees to send short videos with their answers then play the pre-recorded videos live during the meeting, just to make the process a little smoother. You could even play a game of \"two truths and a lie\" by putting up a poll and getting others to ferret out the lie.\nDance break\n— At a recent Welcome all-hands, the marketing team decided to launch into a surprise flash mob at the close of their share and dance the Cupid Shuffle, encouraging everyone else to get up on their feet along with them. Take a page out of our book and dance it out! Get your blood flowing and snap your team out of drowsiness.\nFlash mob: the Welcome crew doing the Cupid Shuffle at a recent all-hands\nConferences & summits: Keep up the energy\nIf you’re running a multi-session, hours-long event, it’s even more crucial to bake moments of connection and delight into your agenda. Otherwise, attendees will eventually drift away in search of more stimulation or leave feeling utterly drained.\nTry these activities:\nVirtual jukebox\n— At the start of the event, set up a musical waiting room. Ask attendees to throw their song requests into the Q&A and tell them to upvote their favorite songs. Play the top-voted songs as the audience awaits the start of the event.\nPop in a poll\n— Use\npolls\nto make sure attendees are actually paying attention and retaining your content. Ask questions that tie back to the content of the session, or throw on a fun trivia game to create a sense of light-hearted competition.\nFind some zen\n— This might be the easiest (and most appreciated) exercise of them all. Thread wellbeing and mindfulness into your event by leading attendees through a calming breathing exercise that helps relieve any stress or anxiety they might be holding onto. Here's a simple one: Start by sitting back in your seat and closing your eyes. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for five counts, then slowly exhale through the nose. Do this a few more times.\nAct as your event's DJ by taking audience song requests. If your attendees need a break, why not ask them to take a quick walk?\nWorkshops & trainings: Find common ground\nWorkshops are a great opportunity to stimulate minds, make things a little more hands-on, and even get introspective. Tap into those benefits by introducing energizers to break the ice and create connections between participants (whether they know each other or not).\nTry these activities:\nGIF it up\n— Kick off the event by inviting participants to describe their current mood in the form of a GIF. Ask them to drop their GIF of choice into the chat.\nShow and tell\n— Get everyone to take a minute to find an object around them (could be anything from a book lying on their desk to a cool-looking vase) that represents them, in any capacity. Have participants go around explaining why they chose their artifact and how it reflects who they are.\n‍\nSpeed drawing\n— Ask your participants to grab a pen and piece of paper. Then give them five minutes to draw a particular scene, whether it be an abstract depiction of themselves, their “happy place”, or a joyful moment from the weekend. Have them share their artistic creations with the group.\nOur GIF of choice: the feeling when you know it's gonna be a good event\nWe hope you can put these exercises into action during your next virtual event to bring the energy to new levels. And remember: While fun and excitement are two qualities any attendee would eagerly seek in a virtual gathering, for an event to really stick, you need to\ntie the content back to the event’s purpose\n. Find ways to connect even the simplest warm-up activity to your main purpose to make the event truly meaningful.\nAbout Welcome\nFrom our interactive polling feature to our state-of-the-art production studio, each of Welcome’s features add up to provide a truly exceptional virtual experience platform. One that not only works seamlessly for an event of any size, but delivers meaningful engagement and data-backed results—all while looking stunningly beautiful.

We might have team members in Chicago, Austin, Los Angeles, or further afield. Even if we still go into the office occasionally, there are some colleagues we might never see face-to-face.\nBecause of our new hybrid reality, we’re tasked with building workplace culture beyond the office and finding new ways to empower our teams. Whether you’re attempting to understand what your team cares about outside of work, monitoring colleagues for signs of burnout, or managing ever-shifting flexwork policies, you can only lead with empathy when your company\ninvests in the right technology\nfor employee belonging.\nIn fact, a\nFuture Forum\nsurvey found that companies that invested heavily in digital infrastructure in 2020 have employees who are two times more likely to feel a greater sense of belonging to their company. This is likely because communication frequency went\nup\nduring the pandemic, as knowledge workers found ways to reach out, stay in touch, and collaborate digitally.\nAs research shows, with the right technology for hybrid work—and the right management strategies—you can foster a greater sense of belonging, empower your team, and\nbuild an incredible employee experience\n.\nHere are five new norms you should know—and how they contribute to a more connected, productive, and empowered workplace culture.\n1. Become a “people expert” in your team\nWhile there’s plenty to love about working on a distributed team, remote work has also resulted in more emails, more meetings, and more work about work.\nManagers and people leaders have a special role in alleviating these stressors for their teams. In addition to moving day-to-day projects forward, there are new expectations for managers to track the well-being of their direct reports, recognize and ease the signs of burnout, and identify passion projects that will direct and nurture talent.\nBecoming more attuned to your employees begins as early as\nemployee onboarding\n. Whether you introduce a new company ritual or connect new hires with local colleagues, onboarding is a foundational way to build connections and to provide employees with resources integral to their well-being.\nFor example, at Arianna Huffington’s culture change company\nThrive Global\n, all new employees learn a strategy for managing stress called a “Reset.” Data\nshows\nthat 60 to 90-second breaks, or “resets,” can reduce stress and anxiety. At Thrive, new hires gather inspirational quotes and images into their own personal “Reset,” which they can use to take breaks throughout the work day.\nIn addition to supporting personal needs for new members of your team, you can also consider large-scale onboarding solutions that foster belonging. At\nSlack\n, for example, they trained employees to lead local onboarding sessions, as a way to provide new hires with regional connections. Combined with social Slack channels devoted to casual conversation, this in-person approach to onboarding helped employees build more meaningful relationships from day one.\nFor more insights into becoming a “people expert” in your team, check out our event replays on\nleading with empathy\nand\npreventing burnout\n.\n2. Embrace “core collaboration” hours\nOne way to foster a sense of\nemployee belonging\nis to focus on how your team collaborates. Overall, the easier it is to work together in a distributed team, the\nhappier\nyour team will be.\nFor distributed teams, this means doing more than resisting the silos that spring up between departments as a result of remote work. It goes to the very heart of how your company addresses remote work policies, including\nwhen\nyour team is available to work together.\nNavigating flexwork policies with intention requires instituting policies around “core collaboration” hours. What time of day can everyone switch from asynchronous work to synchronous work? How many times a week should you hold your core collaboration hours?\nThe more consistent and transparent you are about developing and enacting these policies, the easier it will be to eliminate time-wasting meetings and alleviate the expectation for near-constant availability that leads to burnout.\nOf course, flexwork also means you need the right technology to work asynchronously, especially if you have a hybrid or distributed team. Whether that’s a communication platform like\nSlack\nto help speed collaboration or an employee event platform like\nWelcome\nthat connects your entire organization in a virtual auditorium,\ninvesting in the right tech stack\nmakes or breaks your ability to collaborate digitally.\nThere’s plenty of data to back this up. We already know employees who lack flexibility at work are\nunhappy\n. And we know that\nbetter collaboration\nleads to a stronger sense of employee belonging. Now, it’s time to put those key findings together into the right strategies—and the right tools—for your distributed team.\n3. Show your team you “see” them\nWhat does it mean to be “visible” during hybrid work?\nAs head of\nActivTrak\n’s Productivity Lab, Gabriela Mauch set out to define visibility in our new context. She discovered that different segments of workers define visibility differently—but that all definitions help us understand what employees need to thrive.\nAccording to Mauch’s\nfindings\n:\nExecutives need visibility for strategic alignment and monitoring overall company health.\nMid-level managers need visibility to monitor team performance and to help their teams avoid burnout.\nEmployees need visibility into their peers’ communication preferences and schedules, so they can collaborate in supportive ways.\nBy reflecting back to your team their efforts, helping them navigate distractions and roadblocks, and supporting transparent flexwork policies, you’ll ensure that the employees you manage feel seen, heard, and supported in our new ways of working.\nIn addition to day-to-day work, visibility also means that you’re making time to shout out successes during\nall-hands meetings\n, identify passion projects that map onto employee skills, and create opportunities for additional training and skill-building.\nAfter all, when employees feel like they’re being invested in, they’re not only more engaged in their work—they’re more likely to feel a sense of ownership in your organization and\nstick around\n.\n4. Treat employee experience seriously\nOrganizations can no longer afford to ignore employee experience. Those who do will fall behind in the fight to retain talent and struggle to build an incredible workplace culture.\nOne recent Future Forum Pulse\nsurvey\nfound that knowledge workers working in less flexible environments reported strikingly low EQ scores. Employees who returned to in-office work full-time reported 1.5 times more stress and anxiety than hybrid employees and were 1.6 times less likely to be satisfied at their jobs.\nBut it’s not enough to simply count on remote or hybrid work policies keeping your employees happy, productive, and engaged. By taking regular polls and measuring EQ scores over time, you can continually identify areas of employee experience for improvement.\nYou can also, as McKinsey analysts suggest,\nidentify the “moments that matter”\nthroughout your employee life cycle, from recruitment to employee onboarding to their final day. Each touchpoint has unique demands—and unique solutions—for your team. Find out what your organization does well, and where it can do better, measuring progress and iterating along the way.\nFor example, if your organization is concerned about employee belonging, you might identify key performance indicators for that goal, map specific belonging strategies onto each touchpoint, and continue to measure and improve as you receive employee feedback.\n5. Build and maintain your company’s workplace culture together\nMore than ever, employees want a say in their company’s workplace culture. Managers and people leaders can take advantage of this trend by inviting employees to collaborate on culture in meaningful ways.\nThis process might be different from traditional work models, but McKinsey research suggests that\nco-designing employee experience\nwith your team leads to higher levels of employee engagement, better retention, and deeper, more human connections at work.\nFrom incorporating social elements into your team’s day-to-day work experience to finding opportunities for reflection about work and organizational priorities, you can work together with your team to design a better employee experience.\nFinal Thoughts\nNew norms for distributed teams are impacting employee experience at every stage of the employee lifecycle. From onboarding to skill-building, you have opportunities to empower employee belonging, build a stronger workplace culture, and improve employee experience.\nWelcome\nis the employee event platform that supports you at each stage of the employee journey. Hold\nonboarding\nsessions that help new hires build meaningful relationships, measure employee sentiment scores at each\nall-hands meeting\n, and build company culture together with your\nemployee resource groups\n.\nStart designing workplace culture for your distributed team at your very next gathering—contact us below for a demo or to find out more!\n‍\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/workplace-culture-new-norms\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

Cheat off my test!” — Shaquille O’Neal, 4x NBA Champion\nAs I reflect on my journey as an Asian American entrepreneur, I’m reminded of this quote. Contrary to the mainstream narrative, the concept of the “self-made” tech entrepreneur is somewhat exaggerated. The fact is, we were all influenced by those who went before us to show us what’s possible. We naturally look to people of similar backgrounds and situations to see how they did it. Everyone, to a certain extent, cheats off someone else’s test.\nFor me, that person was my father. He grew up in poverty in China, and through sheer grit and determination, managed to secure a better life for our family in the United States. Keep in mind, this was during the 1980s, when immigration between China and the United States was extremely difficult. I still remember his stories about doing back-breaking farm labor during the Cultural Revolution.\nHe taught himself English by assembling a shortwave radio and listening to English broadcasts from Japan. When a professor visited from the United States, he jumped at the opportunity to talk to him in English. The professor was so impressed that he offered my dad entry into Ohio State University’s PhD program. When he arrived in the US, he played an instrumental role in the Tiananmen Square protests, fighting to give Chinese the same rights that he enjoyed in the United States.\nDuring the Dot-Com Boom of the 90s, my father moved our family to San Francisco. It was there that I developed my love for technology and entrepreneurship. I saw other immigrant founders, like Jerry Yang of Yahoo, start huge world-changing companies. This drove me to study computer science at UC Berkeley and begin a career as a software engineer in Silicon Valley.\nAround this time, I met Roberto Ortiz, who quickly became a good friend and is now one of my co-founders. I was inspired not only by his talent, but by his journey. He grew up in inner city Philadelphia with a single mother and four siblings, in an environment as far from the hustle and bustle of the tech world as you could get. Against all odds, he made it to Silicon Valley and became a top designer. During the summers, he’d go back to his old high school and tell the kids about his experience in tech.\nThe idea of opening doors for those who may not have the same influences I did is a big reason why I love working at Welcome. With the rise of virtual events, it’s no longer necessary to move to a specific city or country to gain exposure to tech. One of our customers,\nPlato\n, hosts frequent round tables with top engineering leaders. These events are open to everyone around the world.\nNo need for a plane ticket or hotel room to get access to the top minds in Silicon Valley.\nAccess is another reason we’re dedicated to building a fully remote company. Tech talent shouldn't be limited by geography, and we want to hire anyone regardless of where they happen to live. With geographic barriers out of the way, we’re excited to continue to build out our distributed team.\nWe’d love for you to join us\n.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/cheat-off-my-test\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

So, how do you make it possible for employees to speak up about what's happening in their reality, especially if their reality isn't positive? The answer is you give them the opportunity early and often. If you do that, you'll find that you have the information you need to take action to improve things.\n5 Ways to Give Leaders Constructive Feedback\nAccording to an AllVoices survey, 79% of employees have shared feedback with their employer, 41% have left the job because they didn't feel listened to, and 37% have left the job because they thought the feedback wasn't being taken seriously in the workplace.\nIt's essential to create multiple options for employees to speak up so they feel comfortable giving constructive feedback to leaders. Here are five different channels that you can implement within your organization.\nBuild Trust With an Open Door Policy\nAn open door policy means every manager's door is open to every employee. Having one can encourage open communication, transparency, feedback, and discussion among managers and employees.\nTo quote Harold S. Geneen;\n\"A true leader has to have a genuine open door policy so that his people are not afraid to approach him for any reason.\"\nThis communication policy should foster trust throughout the company, and employees should not fear retaliation should they raise issues with the company or their work with any managers.\n‍\nGive Tips for Having Conversations With Their Direct Leadership\nGiving constructive feedback to your manager can feel awkward. Employees may be worried they'll take it the wrong way, and it may feel too risky. But if you have an open door policy, managers should be open to honest sharing and \"upward\" feedback. Ensure you train all employees on how to deliver feedback appropriately and tactfully. Some tips to share are:\nFocus on solutions instead of complaints.\nConstructive feedback should help build toward a positive outcome.\nCut straight to the chase.\nGetting straight to the point leaves no room for interpretation.\nBe honest.\nHonesty is the best policy. Just make sure to remain professional.\nProvide an Anonymous Channel for Employee Feedback\nHaving an\nemployee feedback management platform\nhelps employees speak up about anything they want to at work, positive, negative, and neutral, in real-time. It's essential to have a two-way communication channel so that HR leaders, legal leaders, CEOs, and anyone in the leadership role can have a back-and-forth conversation with that employee. And since it's anonymous, employees feel safe speaking up without fearing retaliation.\nSchmidt referenced a study from the\nU.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\nthat said 75% of people who experience sexual harassment in the workplace never report it. So they don't share that information with someone who could take action and address it. Of the 25% who do report it, 75% face some retaliation for speaking up.\n\"These data points represent a broken system,\" said Schmidt. \" I think pre-MeToo movement, we, as a society, just said to employees, speak up, or nobody will help you. And those are your two options. According to that data, employees, for the most part, just stayed quiet.\"\nAn anonymous channel allows employees to speak up in a space that feels safer and is in real-time. So they don't need to fear retaliation, and the right people become aware of the issue to help resolve it.\nSend Pulse Surveys\nAnnual surveys are an excellent tool for helping you gauge the cultural health of your organization year over year and if it's trending in the right direction. But sometimes, you must quickly tap into your employees' views and feelings. Schmidt explains, \"Maybe managers hear whispers that people are unhappy with the PTO policy, and it's beginning to ripple throughout the organization. Sending a pulse survey that day asking questions about the new policy will help you pull information about a particular and actionable topic in real-time.\"\nPulse surveys differ from annual surveys in the following ways:\nMore frequent.\nPulse surveys could be weekly, monthly, quarterly, or case-by-case.\nMore specific.\nPulse surveys focus on a specific topic, whereas annual surveys cover a more comprehensive range of topics.\nShorter.\nBecause pulse surveys focus on one particular topic, fewer questions are asked.\nConduct Stay Interviews\nTurning the Great Resignation into the Great Retention will take some effort from leaders. An excellent start is by listening to employees' needs and addressing inequities. One way to do this is by conducting stay interviews. We've all heard of exit interviews, which allow a departing employee to explain why they're leaving and offer feedback. \"It's helpful, but that employee is already out the door, so it's too little, too late when retaining them,\" says Schmidt.\nStay interviews are the inverse of exit interviews. Schmidt explains, \"Leaders from within the company set up a time to talk one-on-one with individual employees about why they're staying onboard and not leaving. It's an opportunity to uncover what's working well/not well, what employees' like/dislike about their jobs and company, how the company can better support them as an employee and how to ensure that that employee will still be at your organization a year from now.\"\nWhen conducting a stay interview, start with these five questions:\nWhat do you look forward to at work every day?\nWhat do you dislike about work every day?\nWhat do you think of the way employees are recognized?\nHow would you rate our work/life balance, and how would you improve it?\nWhat can I do to make your experience better?\nKeep in mind that the key to conducting a stay interview is actively listening to what they say and asking thoughtful follow-up questions.\nSchmidt explains that employees might still fear retaliation, but at least you're allowing them to speak up and showing them that you and the organization are receptive to and want their feedback.\nImplementing a combination of all the above practices can be incredibly valuable at painting a comprehensive picture of what's going on with employees.\nWatch the entire event\nhere\nfor more ideas and constructive feedback best practices.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/how-to-give-company-leaders-constructive-feedback-without-fearing-retaliation\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

Attendees are no longer just employees or clients or customers. They're busy people with lives, growing to-do lists, and a million distractions. Digital experiences aren’t just nice-to-have, but essential. Attention is earned, not given.\nAs vaccination rates rise and in-person events become more viable, what’s ahead for virtual event marketing in 2022?\nVirtual Events: From Pivot to Pivotal\nWhen the world shut down in 2020, virtual events were a quick band-aid for in-person events around the globe. Consisting of little more than a slideshow with speakers sitting in their living rooms, virtual events allowed marketers and companies to quickly stay connected even while apart. They were lo-fi and low-cost with a low production value.\nNow virtual events have become more sophisticated, more engaging, and more dynamic. They're no longer a necessary substitute for big-ticket events, but big-ticket events themselves with their own set of advantages: scalability, accessibility, affordability.\nIn fact, according to LinkedIn’s\nState of Virtual Events Report\n, 75% of event marketers plan to continue running virtual events into next year and beyond. As we look to the year ahead, one thing is clear: the bar for virtual events keeps rising.\nGreat virtual event marketing doesn’t just happen, it’s planned.\nThe model for how we plan, launch, and market virtual events has shifted. Attention is more important than attendance. Experience and content demand a digital-first approach. Leveraging\nvirtual event platforms\nto foster engagement, connection, and participation is table stakes.\nWhen planning a virtual event, it’s more important than ever to know your audience inside and out. Who are they? What are their needs and interests? What are they hoping to gain from attending? What might be their time constraints or distractions? And where will they be watching?\nNo matter your audience or your company’s goals, consider ways to make your event the most valuable way they can spend their time. Diversifying your speaker lineup, producing entertaining videos, and planning breakout sessions are good places to start.\nGoing back to in-person events\nWhile the idea of “back to normal” might be a thing of the past, going back to in-person events isn’t. According to a 2021\nMarTech study,\nnearly 85% of marketers surveyed expect to attend an in-person event in 2022.\nHowever, expectations for these events have changed. People are less-likely to travel internationally to attend a conference, preferring smaller, local, and more intimate settings, like localized “pods.”\nMany attendees are also interested in safety measures, like mandatory masks, sanitizer stations, social distancing, limited attendance, and proof of vaccination.\nAccording to that same MarTech study, however, more than 90% of respondents want to see virtual events remain—even as in-person events reemerge. Enter hybrid events.\nHybrid events: more than just a buzzword\n2022 is shaping up to be a hybrid year that straddles the line between a pre- and post-pandemic world. Remote work, flexible schedules, and mask-wearing will be coupled with the opening of travel and larger in-person gatherings. It’s no wonder, then, that hybrid events are front and center for event marketers, sales teams, and companies.\nBy definition, a hybrid is a mixture of two different things.\nWhen it comes to\nhybrid events\n, hybrid means optimizing the experience for both virtual and in-person audiences, and purposefully creating opportunities for these two audiences to engage.\nInstead of live-streaming keynotes or using recorded video for on-demand viewing, incorporate audience Q&As, offer intimate fireside chats, and include live polling. Think of ways to make your digital and in-person audiences feel engaged, included, and appreciated, like high-quality video and exclusive opportunities with speakers.\nTech Tip:\nBring your in-person and virtual attendees together, no matter where they are. Choose  a virtual event platform with a mobile web app, like Welcome’s, which bridges the gap between hybrid audiences. Even in-person attendees can chat, ask questions, and participate in polls—right from their phones.\n2022 Virtual Event Marketing Trends\nThe need for experience-driven virtual events is here to stay. And with it comes the opportunity to engage a far wider, more diverse audience. Here are some of 2022’s biggest trends in virtual event marketing to incorporate into your event strategy.\n‍\nAccessibility is front and center\nVirtual events have made attending conferences more accessible than ever. Costs are lower, which means companies can send more employees. There’s also fewer logistics for attendees to coordinate, and zero plane tickets to buy.\nSince audiences  can now attend a virtual event from anywhere in the world, here are a few other things to keep in mind:\nLanguage - Incorporate live translation technology that offers a seamless viewing experience for attendees, no matter where they are or what language they speak.\nAbility - Include\nlive captioning\nand screen reading technology to make your event inclusive.\nTime - From parents to freelancers, attendees are juggling priorities more than ever. Create shorter, more intentional events that last hours instead of days—while still delivering meaningful content.\nCost - People will most likely attend virtual events from their homes, bedrooms, and other shared living spaces. If you're saving money on location costs, consider how making your event more affordable opens up doors to a new audience.\nEntertainment and production value is on the rise\nAudiences expect jaw-dropping experiences no matter where they are. Taking into account the demands of peoples’ lives and the demands on their attention, virtual events need to be interactive and entertaining.\nCreate high-quality video that offers something additional to the live content. Think trailers, recaps, and cameos.\nPare down your speaker list and invite only the most relevant experts. This way, you can increase opportunities for attendees to engage, meet, and share.\nBoost production value\nby live-streaming speakers from stage, either in-person or virtually.\nPartner with a\nvirtual marketing platform\nto increase audience participation, host breakout groups, and track engagement.\nThink digital first, even when going hybrid\n‍\nDigital experiences often get overlooked during traditional event planning. But hybrid events depend on a strong digital focus.  Understand who you’re engaging, how you’re encouraging participation, and which interactions your attendees find most valuable. .\nBuild\ninformative agendas\nand schedules that are easy to find and use.\nBlend live and pre-recorded content to create entertaining, crowd-sourced videos.\nOffer lounge and breakout rooms to facilitate networking opportunities.\nLeverage live Q&As, chats, and polling technology to make digital audiences anywhere feel included.\nPromote safety first, even when going virtual. From gated entry and restricted registration to SSO-enabled logins, keep your attendees and their data safe.\nMicro-events, mini-summits, and intimate gatherings\nSometimes less really\nis\nmore. And in the case of events, this adage proves true. From global summits to small sales conferences, giving attendees an intimate experience is important. With the scalability of virtual events, creating intimacy is no longer a nice-to-have. It's a must-have.\nFocus more on conversation and connection than pitching. You can follow up with a targeted sales call after the event.\nOffer 1-on-1 or small-group chat sessions about certain topics or interests.\nHost virtual micro-events that target specific audiences or time zones.\nInstead of multi-day affairs, launch a weekly or monthly event series that people can look forward to and can easily fit into their calendars.\nVirtual events target the entire marketing funnel\nDigital events will continue to play a role in sales and lead acquisition. However, it's easier than ever to leverage your events for awareness, consideration, loyalty, and advocacy, too.\nEngage your audience before, during, and after the event. Consider when \"awareness\" versus \"consideration\" messaging is most welcome and appropriate.\nFocus  on event quality and entertainment value. This will likely push  sales messaging to new mediums, like post-event emails, calls, and meetings.\nGive your event a second and even third life. Make keynote speakers available on-demand and leverage short-form video for marketing campaigns, just as\nForrester recommends\n.\nFinal Thoughts\nLooking ahead to 2022, the exciting changes in event marketing make two things clear: virtual events are here to stay and digital audiences expect to be awed. Luckily, with\nevent marketing platforms\nlike Welcome, creating jaw-dropping virtual and hybrid experiences is easier than ever.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/virtual-event-and-marketing-trends-to-watch-for-in-2022\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

A recent study from\nPolly\nfound that employees now spend an average of 10 hours a week in virtual meetings, a steep 5x increase from pre-pandemic times.\nAccording to that same study, 90% of employees are also using this increased screen time to multitask and do pretty much anything other than participate in work: check emails, respond to texts, online shop. Increased distractions and screen fatigue are real.\nAnd when it comes to virtual events, these are the top challenges marketers are up against.\nWhen planning your next virtual marketing event, consider the ways you can engage your audience, encourage participation, and be responsive to their input. Without interesting and engaging content, you'll be competing against an attendee's busy personal and professional life. And that's a battle you can't afford to lose.\nTech Tip:\nPartner with a virtual event platform like\nWelcome\nto access tools and tech that make it easy to host experience-driven events.\n8 Ideas for Your Next Virtual Event\nWhether your next virtual marketing event is right around the corner or far off in the future, there are infinite ways to earn your audience’s attention.\nHere are some of our favorite ideas to spark inspiration.\n1. Live content meets pre-recorded video\nLet’s face it, there’s nothing as exciting as gathering together live (Beyoncé concerts included). But pre-recorded content gives you the opportunity to plan ahead, coordinate production, develop branded graphics, and edit final takes.\nMixing live speakers and workshops with pre-recorded intros, short-form video, and entertaining snippets gives your audience the best of both worlds.\nTech Tip\n: Add digital overlays, speaker or event titles, and dynamic graphics to pre-recorded and live video with Welcome’s easy-to-use tools in\nStage kit\n.\n‍\n2. Personalized content\nGlobal summits typically have multiple stages with different events going on at the same time. If you’re planning a large virtual marketing event for a diverse audience, consider planning different tracks that allow audience members to tune in for exactly what interests them.\nThat way, attendees can follow an A versus B schedule, or mix and match events to their choosing. Plus, if your event registration captures preferences, you can create custom marketing segments for each topic to engage your audience before, during, and after your event.\n3. Intimate workshops\nBig, glitzy events with even bigger, glitzier speakers are wonderful. But so are intimate, hands-on workshops that allow attendees to get to know each other and learn something tangible.\nWhen planning your event, consider ways to weave in workshops that have a specific theme and a tangible outcome, like public speaking skills, mindfulness, or even meet-and-greets with company leaders.\n4. Speaker lineups\nSpeakers are your event’s product: in many ways they’re what drives interest in, and attendance to your event. When creating a lineup, consider who is relevant to your audience, who can help you reach new people, and who can teach something out-of-the-box and new.\nPick leaders from across industries who bring unique points of view to the table. Prioritizing life experience over a resume is also a great way to expand and enhance your lineup.\n5. Interactive storytelling\nHarvard professor Dr. Howard Gardner said that “stories constitute the single most powerful weapon in a leader’s arsenal.” And the same is true for your virtual event. Stories create powerful emotional connections between speakers and attendees. But in this new age of screen-fatigue, it’s critical to bring these stories to life in interactive ways.\nThink dynamic media, graphic overlays, and b-roll footage and montages, along with audience polling, pulling attendees onstage, and providing choose-your-own adventure opportunities. Even in virtual meetings, there’s always opportunities to incorporate simple interactive activities, like group stretching or scavenger hunts.\n6. Audience participation\nThe first rule of virtual events is to never leave audience participation to chance. When you partner with a\nvirtual event platform\n, your arsenal of engagement tools expands exponentially.\nIncorporate moderated and on-stage Q&As,\nembed polls\ndirectly on the screen, and offer one-on-one or public chatting to encourage meaningful audience engagement. When you ask your audience their opinion and reflect their input live, you’re sure to keep their attention — and participation — for the whole time.\n7. Gamification and prizes\nFrom leaderboards to team quizzes, nothing brings people together like healthy competition. Consider ways to gamify your virtual event, like rewarding session attendance with badges, organizing a virtual scavenger hunt across different rooms and lounges, or leveraging small breakout sessions for teams to build and share ideas.\n8. Social integration\nEncouraging social media interactions during your virtual event is a great way to give your audience more chances to connect and share, while also extending the reach of your event.\nStart and moderate a chat using a hashtag, stream behind-the-scenes content on Instagram Live, or even ask attendees to post photos from your event and tag you. In order to develop the best social strategy, think about who your audience is, where they like to spend their time, and how you can tap into their habits to make your own event even more engaging.\nFinal Thoughts\nWhen you put your audience in the driver’s seat, shift your mindset, and intentionally create content that entertains a digital audience, you can transform any virtual marketing event into a jaw-dropping experience. With a little planning and a great\nvirtual event platform\n, your next virtual marketing event will be well on its way to success.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/8-ideas-for-your-next-virtual-marketing-event\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

Pure information distribution can be done through asynchronous channels, such as e-mail or Slack. Culture can also be imparted through happy hours or Zoom hangouts. But the townhall is unique in that it serves as a channel for both information and culture simultaneously.\nBecause of COVID, companies have been forced to move their townhalls online. As the world opens up, many workers will return to the office, but most people and communications leaders still\nanticipate a sizable remote contingent\n. Because of this, it’s more important than ever to make sure your next company townhall is impactful for your remote employees.\nHere are 4 fireproof ways to supercharge your next virtual townhall.\nHype up the crowd\nIn life as well as business, first impressions are everything. Most remote employees spend their days in a series of Zoom meetings, which is why it’s important that your event starts with a different energy.\nI had a conversation with one of our largest customers recently. They mentioned that they think of the beginning of a townhall meeting like the previews that roll before a movie showing. Just as they do at the movies, pre-recorded videos, music, and fun polls create an anticipatory and fun atmosphere for company events.\nIf you’re using a video conferencing tool like Zoom, you can do this by sharing your screen and playing videos from your computer. If you want to get really fancy, video production tools like VMix or OBS take your production value to the next level and make the pre-roll look like a TV show. If that sounds too complicated, you can do both on a single platform with Welcome.\nWe’ve seen countless\ncompany townhalls\nhosted on the Welcome platform, and one of the most overlooked aspects is a good MC. A good MC increases the engagement of your townhall dramatically. One of the best ways to hype up the crowd is to ask questions and have them drop answers in chat. It might be impossible to capture the “roar of the crowd” in a typical video conference. However, an avalanche of chat responses creates a fair approximation. As the rising popularity of Twitch streaming demonstrates, a highly produced live event hosted by a talented MC who knows how to fire up the chat is a powerful combination.\nAt Welcome we have a saying: great events are about both tech and touch. All the technology in the world is no good if you don’t know how to take advantage of it to\ncreate a memorable experience\n.\nGo beyond the slide deck\nLet’s face it: slide decks were not built for remote presentations.\nWe’ve all been in those awkward meetings where the presenter tries to get screenshare working, so he can share his PowerPoint deck. Even when it does work, there’s something missing from the experience.\n‍\nCustom overlays\nare a longstanding staple of video production software, and you can use them with any existing video tool. They’re also natively built into the Welcome platform. Instead of a boring slide presentation, the right overlays give your townhall a TV-show feel and make your executives look like stars.\nUsing overlays as a presentation tool also has a nice side benefit: you’re forced to put less information on the slide. We’ve all seen presentation decks filled to the brim with information. Overlays offer limited screen real estate, which means you need to keep it minimal. This makes presentations more engaging, and the audience spends time watching the speaker instead of reading the slides.\nBake in interactivity\nTownhalls are a dull affair when employees feel like they are being talked at. Part of the issue with most virtual event or\nwebinar\nsoftware is that it’s built primarily as a presentation tool, so engagement comes second. The live engagement of a Zoom or Teams meeting also becomes unmanageable once the townhall gets too large.\nOne way that we’ve found to increase engagement and interactivity is to encourage frequent feedback through chat and polls. Unfortunately, platforms like Zoom hide chat or make it difficult to find. That’s why we’ve made chat a first-class feature at Welcome and offer Giphy and emoji support.\nChat, in particular, is a very underrated way to increase engagement. Seeing messages fly by in the chat approximates the energy of a live crowd. Polls can also be used to solicit feedback and  engage employees who aren’t as comfortable with chat. As soon as you see all the fire emojis in a Welcome townhall chat box, you’ll understand the difference!\nCreate memorable experiences\nA cottage industry of virtual experience companies have cropped up during the pandemic, and many of them have worked directly with the Welcome platform. I’ll never forget the energy of the crowd when we brought a freestyle rapper on stage to summarize our\nall-hands meeting\n!\nSome other successful experiences we’ve seen at virtual townhalls include:\nMeditation classes\nWine tasting\nMixology classes\nLive music\nTrivia shows\nBy breaking up the monotony of business-focused content and injecting energy into your meeting,\nvirtual experiences\nare one of the most effective ways to increase engagement at your townhall.\nMake time for networking\nAccording to studies, one of the biggest downsides of remote work is feeling disconnected with your coworkers. Most Zoom meetings get straight to business, and it’s difficult to connect with colleagues throughout the day.\nA virtual townhall is a great opportunity not only to hear from executives and leaders, but also to\nallow employees to connect with one another\n. This can be difficult on most technology platforms, which are built for webinars or meetings—not social connection.\nOn Welcome, we’ve made sure that your business and social experiences  flow seamlessly together. This means that you can have a 30-minute keynote followed by 30 minutes of discussion in small groups. Alternating between presentations and small group networking helps break up the monotony and amps up the opportunities for connection.\nFinal Thoughts\nCreating a great virtual or hybrid\ntownhall meeting\nis still a challenge for many people leaders. But that’s because most video conferencing tools don’t have the features you need to produce fun and meaningful events. Given the importance of townhalls, the ROI of a strong event is incredibly high for your company culture. Whether you opt for a\nvirtual experience\n, hire an MC, or find creative ways to amp up your chat box, these event tips will make your next townhall more engaging than ever.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/supercharge-townhall-meeting\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

Yet despite the blazing-fast rate of new Latinx entrepreneurs entering the market each year, only 2% of VC-backed companies are Latinx-founded.

In fact,\nFuture Forum\nfound that companies that led the charge in tech investment scored higher in areas like sense of belonging and stress management—in addition to focus and productivity.\nBelow, we identified the five areas where tech can support remote teams—and how you can focus your investments to unlock your team’s potential.\n1. Communicate\nFor remote or distributed teams, asynchronous communication is the way to go. Tools like\nSlack\n, email, and\nZoom\nhelp your team communicate—no matter what time zone they’re working in.\nCommunication is directly tied to employee belonging and wellbeing.\nFuture Forum\nfound that employees who are on teams that communicate throughout the day are 3x more likely to feel a sense of belonging and 5x more likely to feel they are managing their stress and anxiety effectively. These same employees also reported 50% higher rates of focus and productivity.\nWhile communication tools are crucial for staying in touch, they should also be used with intention. Don’t assume that every team member can—or should—be available at every moment of the work day. Create synchronous communication hours for your company, so everyone knows when to log on—and when they can schedule time for deep work.\nSetting clear priorities, deadlines, and availability hours can also cut down on the deluge of notifications and meetings that have accompanied remote work. A new study from\nAsana\nfound that remote workers are dealing with more emails and notifications than ever. They’re also sitting in more meetings\nabout\nwork—rather than getting important work done.\nRather than adding to an overwhelming calendar, set meetings only when you need to discuss something important or make decisions. And encourage your team to turn off notifications, too—especially when they’re not at work. That way, they can feel like their work day is\nreally\nover. And they’ll be excited about coming back to work again tomorrow!\n2. Connect\nFor remote teams, it’s even more important to think beyond the virtual check-in or team meeting. Remote workers are\nmore likely\nto feel disconnected and isolated, which can lead to disengagement and loss of productivity.\nThat’s why it’s up to company leaders to find the right technical solutions for creating community and building company culture. Employee event platforms like\nWelcome\nprovide a virtual auditorium so you can connect with your team through high-quality experiences.\nFrom\nteam building activities\nto\nvirtual experiences\n, quality time together helps your team work more effectively. In fact, research from\nGallup\nshows that employees who develop meaningful relationships at work are more productive, profitable, and creative. Plus, the virtual events you hold will only make your existing communication channels, like Slack or Zoom, feel more personal.\nWhether you establish company time dedicated to social conversations or a special place for\nemployee resource groups\n, event software helps you do more than just meet. It helps you stay connected, focused, and motivated.\n3. Collaborate\n‍\nWe’re used to thinking of the physical office as the place where we collaborate, but new technology makes it easier than ever to collaborate synchronously and asynchronously with distributed teams, too.\nBrainstorm together using\nGoogle Docs\nor invest in visual whiteboards like\nMiro\nor\nMural\n. Whether you’re conducting a workshop in real time or collecting ideas to discuss later, these tools help teams collect ideas and problem solve both off- and online.\nThis level of flexibility is key. Even though more than\n80% of knowledge workers\nsay that they still see the office as a potential place for in-person collaboration or client meetings, there are\njust as many remote workers\nwho value flexibility above all—and hesitate to return to the office full-time. For these team members, virtual whiteboards can provide a taste of the in-person office experience—all while providing them the flexibility to contribute from anywhere.\nUltimately, great collaboration tools give managers and leaders the flexibility to work with teams in the office\nor\nremotely. By investing intentionally in flexible technology, you can move seamlessly between remote and in-person meetings. This gives you the most bang for your buck while supporting your remote workers with\nmore equitable approaches\nto meetings and collaborations.\n4. Plan\nRemote teams are bombarded with notifications and meeting requests. Over the pandemic, software company\nAsana\ndiscovered that “work about work” had increased. About 60% of a knowledge worker’s time is shaped by “communicating about work, searching for information, switching between apps, managing shifting priorities, and chasing status updates,” the productivity experts found.\nThat means workers who are already stretched thin are participating in more touch-bases and one-on-ones—just to clarify key details like roles, responsibilities, and deadlines. With all this “work about work” standing in the way, it’s harder than ever for distributed teams to tackle projects head on or find time to really “flow.”\nEliminate confusion and clear up your team’s day-to-day by using project management software. Tools like\nAsana\n,\nTrello\n, and\nJira\ncan support your team as you create tasks, assign responsibility, manage a pipeline of work, and push projects over the finish line. Ideally without scheduling extra meetings along the way!\n5. Share\nMaking it easier for remote teams to find and access the right information for their jobs isn’t just a productivity issue—it’s an equity one, too. Early on in the pandemic, McKinsey found that companies that were good at sharing information were healthier, more transparent, and more attuned to issues of equity in the workplace.\nGive your teams the tools they need to find and share information crucial to their work. That includes storage options like\nDropbox\nand\nGoogle Drive\n, as well as hybrid organizational tools like\nNotion\n.\nRemember, the value of sharing information and increasing transparency is important for leadership to model, too. Tools like\nWelcome\nhelp you take company-wide polls and share employee feedback in real time. By continually taking the temperature of the room—and increasing transparency about what you find—you can build a culture of accountability that extends from the top down.\nFinal Thoughts\nInvesting in the right tools for remote work makes all the difference. Remote teams don’t just need ways to communicate—they need ways to connect, collaborate, and share synchronously and asynchronously.\nBecause your team depends on you to build a better remote work culture, choose tools like\nWelcome\nthat help you support a distributed workforce. As your virtual auditorium,\nWelcome\npowers the key events that build remote culture, improve transparency, and spark meaningful connections. From\nemployee onboarding\nto\nvirtual team building\n, Welcome is a powerful solution for remote teams that want more from their work.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/remote-work-technology\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

Whether the goal was to meet new contacts or potential employers, the ability to extend your professional network was often the reason people attended conferences in the first place. But when events moved online, the networking component fizzled. Many event platforms scrambled to add live streaming and struggled to provide the same experience in-person events were known for.\nFrom Day 1, Welcome has taken a data-driven approach to design the perfect environment that enables authentic human connection and interaction. Features like Lounges and Breakouts provide intimate spaces for small groups and direct chat has opened up attendee-to-attendee communication. Today, we're happy to announce that Welcome is adding to our existing networking feature set with 1:1 Video Calls.\nDrive more meaningful connections\n1:1 Video Calls help turn serendipitous connections into meaningful conversations by allowing attendees to directly call one another. We know that creating moments of connection is a huge component of an engaging virtual experience. 1:1 Video Calls help create these moments by allowing attendees to initiate a conversation with another person without taking them out of the event. With Picture-in-Picture Support (PiP), the Welcome platform displays a floating video window of the main event so that users can continue watching even while chatting on a call.\nEnabling and initiating video calls is simple. For producers, toggle to enable or disable 1:1 calls. Keep in mind its default is on. For attendees initiating the call, there are two methods that can be used. Hover over the person on the people tab, DM and Video chat controls will appear, or click on the new video chat icon in the DM conversation. Once the call is initiated, a notification will pop up for the attendee being called and they can join directly from the notification.\nPost Event Analytics\nInsights don't end when the event does. Post-event analytics uncover:\nWho chatted with who\nDuration of call\nTimestamp of when attendees join/leave\nInitiator\nEven though the manner we go about networking has changed, there are still ways to build professional relationships online. The Welcome platform, specifically 1:1 Video Calls helps people translate short, live online interactions into lasting relationships. So although networking might look a little different these days, it's still possible to make deep connections with other attendees in a virtual world.\nAbout Welcome\nFrom 1:1 video calls to our state-of-the-art production studio, each of Welcome’s features adds up to provide a truly exceptional virtual experience platform. One that not only works seamlessly for an event of any size but delivers meaningful engagement and data-backed results—all while looking stunningly beautiful.

{"id":"63bf0891-f039-4ef2-baf3-08b961b28805","url":"https://www.experiencewelcome.com/blog/introducing-polling","title":"Introducing polling on Welcome | Welcome Blog","text":"Sign up for The Drip\nJoin 5000+ marketers that receive The Drip newsletter covering the most relevant topics in B2B marketing.\nFirst name\nJob Title\nEmail\n*\nI agree to receive product updates and marketing emails from Welcome (recommended)\nFeatures\nPricing\nResources\nBlog\nMarketing Guides\nSupport\nEvents\nAbout\nLogin\nLogin\nDemo\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/introducing-polling\nPolling for events isn’t exactly a novel idea. They’re frequently used to keep attendees engaged, kickstart conversations, and offer some levity in between long sessions. But executing it well the virtual space is an entirely separate challenge in itself. We’ve seen boxy square polls on Zoom calls that pop up right on top of the speakers’ faces, forcing you to slide them out of the way, or the opposite: detached polls that steal valuable attention away from the main event.\nThese scenarios make it feel like the polls are just an ancillary feature, instead of something that’s intentionally embedded in the run of show. Isn’t it time for a better virtual polling experience?\nIntroducing Polling\nEnter: Welcome’s new integrated polling feature. This isn’t just your run-of-the-mill opinion-recording instrument. We’ve created a seamless polling tool that can be brought to and voted on the same stage that your event is on—making your poll the star of the show (at least while it’s on stage), rather than a mere accessory. All in real time. All on the same interface.\nMoments of connection shouldn't be left up to chance. Every part of your run-of-show can either facilitate or inhibit engagement, and polling is a powerful way to let your attendees\nparticipate\nin your event rather than just spectate. It can also be used throughout your event to capture valuable data, including engagement touchpoints, audience participation, and real-time event feedback.\n‍\nAn engaging event is a memorable one. When you see your audience engage by voting on a poll and reacting to the results in chat, you know they’re feeling less like they’re sitting in a room alone and more like they’re participating in an unforgettable shared experience.\nHere’s what you should know about polls on Welcome.\nNo more boring white boxes. The background color can be set to match your brand, and you even have the option to add in images right next to the poll.\nDesigning a poll takes minutes. All you need is a question and up to ten multiple-choice answers.\nUp to four speakers can be shown on stage, right next to the poll.\nYou can hide results or choose to share them in real time by going into the producer settings. If shared with attendees, they will see the results change dynamically as more responses come in.\nInsert pre-recorded videos: Say you’re pop-quizzing attendees about movies. You can slot in a clip from a movie to offer some more context.\nYou can access polling data directly in the analytics dashboard after the event, from the number of votes to the attendees' individual answers—all broken down by question.\nPolls in the control room\nHow you can use polling\nWhether you’re producing an annual marketing conference for the masses or looking to inject some excitement into your weekly all hands meeting, polls can be used in a myriad of ways to engage your audience.\nQuiz your attendees to make sure they’re actually paying attention and retaining your content.\nThere’s no time like the present to capture valuable (and immediate) feedback. If you’re an event producer, you know how crucial it is to get feedback from as many attendees as possible. Throw on a poll during the event to help you polish up your session as you go, or right at the end to improve future events.\nGet a pulse of your audience—who they are, their roles, goals for the event, and topics they’re most excited about—and use that information to guide the direction of your event.\nUse polls to break the ice and inject humor, during and in between sessions. Plan a trivia game to add a little light-hearted competition among attendees or kick off your weekly team meeting with a game of “two truths and a lie” to get to know your colleagues better.\nAbout Welcome\nFrom our interactive polling feature to our state-of-the-art production studio, each of Welcome’s features add up to provide a truly exceptional virtual experience platform. One that not only works seamlessly for an event of any size, but delivers meaningful engagement and data-backed results—all while looking stunningly beautiful.

To do this, you not only need accurate analytics, but you also need the ability to understand the analysis quickly.\nWith the new Analytics at a Glance Dashboard, your audience engagement and other data insights are visualized in a simple Event Report Card. Now, you can easily gauge how attendees received your event and what their true level of engagement was.\nSo, what kind of engagement indicators can you track? Analytics at a Glance captures:\nAverage time spent at the event\nAverage number of engagements per attendee\nConversion from invited to the event to engaged at the event\nBreakdown of how attendees engaged\nEngagement of attendees over time\nEngagement of attendees by session\nLet’s dig a little deeper to understand what this means for your events.\nSee how long attendees stay at your event\nWith the Event Report Card, you can now see the average time attendees spent at the event as well as their attendance over time. This metric helps event organizers understand at what point during the event attendees may have started to drop. It can also help you pinpoint which speakers resonated with your audience or what type of content was a miss.\nKnow when to introduce new methods of engagement\nNow you can also take cues from your event's engagement report to pump up participation and keep your attendees’ attention at just the right moment. A little extra effort in your next run of show could make a huge difference.\nIf you see a dip in engagement during a particular time period, try mixing up the run of show by inserting a\nreal-time poll\n, encouraging audience participation in the chat, bringing an audience member on stage, or breaking out attendees into smaller groups to encourage meaningful discussion.\nUse the engagement report to your advantage and pinpoint where your event could use some extra love.\nDetermine which session was most successful\nThe session engagement data tells you how many people attended a unique session and the level of the session's engagement.  When looking at this data, you can get a good idea of which sessions or speakers resonated the most with the audience and which resonated the least. Digging deeper into the chat, Q&A, and polling analytics can still be done, but the Engagement Over Time Session Data is a great place to quickly see how sessions performed overall.\nThen use this data strategically during post-event follow-ups. Highlight top sessions and presenters in emails and think about creating a follow-up asset or webinar on the most popular topic or product discussed. Going forward, use your best engagement numbers as your benchmark targets for your next event.\n‍\nMeasure overall event success\nIn the world of virtual events, the ability to captivate your audience is the cornerstone of a successful event. Luckily, with Analytics at a Glance, all the engagement metrics you care about are collected in an easily digestible report.\nIn addition to audience engagement, the report captures conversions throughout the event funnel. Now you can see how many attendees you invited, how many registered, how many attended, and how many engaged in one simple bar chart.\nTrack these metrics for every event to establish a benchmark and see changes in your performance over time. You’ll discover exactly what kind of content is hitting the mark with your crowd.\nAbout Welcome\nFrom event analytics to our state-of-the-art production studio, Welcome’s features add up to a truly exceptional virtual experience platform.

How do you create jaw-dropping and engaging events in an all-virtual world?\nAs the world of virtual events and meetings embraces hybrid experiences, we’re changing right along with you. We created a better hybrid experience for in-person and virtual attendees, so they can connect with one another instead of being siloed into their own environments.\nYou can now manage all this and more from Welcome’s brand new Mobile Web App. Let’s take a look!\nWelcome's Mobile Web App\nVirtual attendees on Welcome have a ton of opportunities to engage with speakers, content, and other attendees. As events and meetings shifted to a hybrid model, we found that in-person attendees don't experience that same level of interaction.\nWelcome's Mobile Web App was created to change that.\nAvailable on both iOS and Android, the Web App brings your in-person and virtual attendees together in one space and bridges the engagement gap between both audiences. Mobile users can now watch the event, chat, ask questions, and participate in polls, allowing your entire audience to engage from anywhere.\nUse the Web App to reach more attendees with the right content and increase your overall session participation and engagement.\nReal-time Live Streaming to Support Interactivity\nWhat makes our Mobile Web App so special?\nThe majority of streaming content distributors are looking for a “real-time” delivery solution. That’s fast—like, less than 1 second from your screen to your viewers’ screens fast.\nUnfortunately, the majority of virtual and mobile audiences experience a delay of 20-45 seconds. Even a short delay deteriorates the engagement level and interactivity of your events.\nThis isn't the case for Welcome's Mobile Web App. Our app streams ultra-low latency video (< 1 second screen-to-screen delay) to mobile devices. Compared to delays of 20 seconds or more on competing platforms, that’s lightning fast.\nWhether attendees watch on their computers or mobile devices, they’ll be streaming and interacting with your content in real time. Say goodbye to awkward, disjointed conversations between virtual and hybrid audiences because both experiences will be exactly the same.\nAlong with giving mobile users the ability to participate in chat, polling, and Q&A, you can also view post-event analytics that provide deep insight into their engagement. With data from both in-person and virtual audiences, you can see the whole story in your post-event analytics.\nWhether attendees are watching your event on the go or attending in-person, the mobile web app enables engagement on a deeper level. Allow your audience to connect, join in, and engage from anywhere with our latest feature.\nAbout Welcome\nFrom the mobile web app to our state-of-the-art production studio, Welcome provides a truly exceptional virtual experience platform that works seamlessly for an event of any size. Welcome also delivers meaningful engagement and data-backed results—all while looking stunningly beautiful. Find out more about the platform by\nbooking a demo\nwith us! We’d love to show you how it all works.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/mobile-web-app-for-hybrid-events\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

{"id":"5f1f66d0-33b2-407d-9767-474795ad8d6e","url":"https://experiencewelcome.com/blog/b2b-marketing-tech-stack","title":"Build Your B2B Marketing Tech Stack | Welcome Blog","text":"Sign up for The Drip\nJoin 5000+ marketers that receive The Drip newsletter covering the most relevant topics in B2B marketing.\nFirst name\nJob Title\nEmail\n*\nI agree to receive product updates and marketing emails from Welcome (recommended)\nFeatures\nPricing\nResources\nBlog\nMarketing Guides\nSupport\nEvents\nAbout\nLogin\nLogin\nDemo\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/b2b-marketing-tech-stack\nB2B Marketing Tech Stack\n‍\n‍\nSelecting the suitable B2B Marketing Tech Stack is one of the more critical decisions that a B2B Marketer and Marketing Operations team will make. With the B2B marketers' challenges always changing and B2B marketing technology becoming increasingly complex, it can be challenging to understand what's critical, what's important, and what is just a “nice to have.”\n‍\nBelow we’ll outline the types of B2B marketing technologies, share our list of top solutions in the market, and share how critical they are to your business so that you can build the best B2b Marketing Tech Stack suited for your business.\n‍\nMarketing Automation Platforms (MAPs)\n‍\nMarketing automation platforms are at the core of any B2B marketing tech stack. They are NOT just an email marketing tool. These platforms are used to capture lead and contact data, segment your audience, automate email marketing and nurture campaigns, build and automate workflows, build and publish forms, automate social media posting, manage advertising campaigns, measure key metrics, create dashboards or reports, build lead scoring processes, and so much more.\n‍\nSome marketing automation platforms, like Hubspot, can\ndouble as your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool\nso that you can manage your marketing automation and activities using the platform and your sales and customer support activities.\n‍\nThese tools start to get\nexponentially more powerful through leveraging integrations\nwith other tools and resources. Marketing automation platforms will often integrate with your CRM, sales automation and enablement tools, billing and invoicing solutions, customer data solutions, advertising solutions, and more. This allows you to a) leverage your marketing data to trigger something to happen in another system or tool (ex. send an invoice or alert a sales rep) or b) listen for events in other systems to then trigger activity in your marketing automation platform (ex. if prospect interacts with an advertisement, add to nurture list in your marketing automation platform).\n‍\nTop B2B Marketing Automation Platforms:\nHubspot - For small and midsize organizations but can scale to enterprise\nMarketo - For complex automation processes and nurture campaigns\nPardot - For organizations that want to keep all data centralized within Salesforce\nEloqua - For mid to large-size organizations\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nCRITICAL. Think of your marketing automation platform as the foundation of your entire marketing technology stack.\nContent Management Systems (CMS)\n‍\nContent Management Systems, or a CMS, is software that helps you… you guessed it… manage your content. But not any content; Content Management Systems are specific to helping you\nmanage content on your website\nwithout needing a designer or intimate knowledge of HTML and CSS.\n‍\nThese tools make it very easy for you to create landing page templates, blog templates, pricing pages, purchasing pages, host or store media (images, audio, video), and capture data and leads with built-in form builders. Many of these tools also integrate with Google Analytics and have Search Engine Optimization (SEO) functionality built to ensure your website is optimized to capture web traffic. But which one is right for you and your business? Below is a list of top CMS providers.\n‍\nTop B2B Marketing Content Management Systems (CMS)\nWebflow\n-For organizations that value design and flexibility out of the box\nWordPress- For organizations that value integrations and ease of use\nDrupal- For organizations that are conscious of budget and like to build\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nCRITICAL. Your website is a 24/7 selling machine. It’s how your audience will find you and learn about you.\n‍\nSearch Engine Optimization and Management (SEO and SEM)\nSearch Engine Optimization and Management tools are often forgotten and not the first solution a B2B marketer may think of purchasing or configuring- but they should. SEO tools and SEM solutions are arguably the most powerful marketing tools in your marketing tech stack for creating and capturing demand.\n‍\nHow do you know if people will find you if they search for your company?\nWill people find you if they search for a problem that you solve? Or for a related topic?\nDo you know what your audience is interested in and what content you should generate in the first place?\n‍\nWhen your audience is searching for something, it means they have a problem that needs a solution. There is no better time in the buyer journey to ensure you show up as one of the solutions they should evaluate. SEO and SEM tools help you execute keyword research, uncover keyword ranking difficulty, and help you track your progress for keywords or phrases you want to improve.\n‍\nTop SEO solutions:\nGoogle Analytics - Analyze web traffic and where it's coming from\nGoogle Search Console - Execute keyword research and analyze search data for your audience\nTop SEM solutions:\nSEMRush - Keyword research, manage keywords and understand ranking difficulty\nAhrefs - Keyword research, manage keywords and understand ranking difficulty. It also has many free, lightweight tools to get you started.\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nCRITICAL.\n‍\nPaid Advertising Analytics and Management\nAlmost every marketing strategy will include investments in paid advertising, especially digital marketing strategies. Paid is one of the most tried and true marketing channels for lead generation and pipeline creation. It’s also one of the more effective ways to test your content marketing strategy and see what messaging resonates with your audience.\n‍\nBut what tools should you use in your marketing technology stack to support your paid strategy? Well… as every marketing operations professional will tell you, it depends. It depends on your target persona and ICP, what they care about, and where they hang out.\n‍\nIf your persona doesn’t live on LinkedIn, you probably don’t want to spend money advertising there, right? Or maybe your target persona is not problem aware AT ALL, so they would never search for a solution, then spending paid on search isn’t going to be that helpful either. It’s vital to figure out WHERE your audience and persona are because if you don’t, your marketing teams will waste time, effort, and money, yielding a minimal return on investment.\n‍\nAfter you understand your persona and where they hang out, the following tools can help you get the most out of your advertising spend and supercharge marketing campaigns across the board.\n‍\nTop Paid B2B Marketing solutions:\nGoogle Adwords - If your persona is problem aware and searching for answers or solutions, you’ll want to leverage Google Adwords\nWordStream- An all-in-one digital advertising solution that can help you manage paid search and Facebook display ads\nSkai - Similar to Wordstream, an all-in-one omnichannel digital advertising solution\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nCRITICAL.\n‍\nWebinars and Virtual Events\n‍\nOne of\nthe most cost-effective ways to generate leads and convert those leads into revenue\nis by having a strong webinar and/or virtual event program\n. Not only do these programs generate and capture leads, but it's also the most cost-effective way to generate content, as you have an endless supply of long-form content to\nrepurpose into short-form content\n.\nIllustration of repurposing content\n‍\nDeciding which webinar platform or virtual event solution is right for you may be more complex than it seems, though. Does it need to integrate into your B2B marketing tech stack? How good of an attendee experience does it need to be? Do you need branding? Do you need to engage with your audience live? How will you repurpose the content (or do you even care about that)?\n‍\nTop Webinar and Virtual Event Platforms:\nWelcome\n- Best in-class webinar and virtual event platform used by organizations that care about how their brand is perceived and their attendees' experience, typically used from B2B marketers to generate leads, content, and revenue.\nOn24\n- Standard webinar platform with many live and on-demand features\nZoom Webinar\n- Reliable, easy-to-use platform for marketers who may not care about brand perception, audience engagement, or attendee experience. Typically used by small businesses and small startups.\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nImportant.\nWebsite Optimization and Personalization\n‍\nSo you’ve built a website and successfully drove traffic to it through paid advertising, social media, and search- but how do you make sure you’re optimizing your site to convert that traffic into paying customers? You don’t want all those marketing efforts going to waste, but A/B testing your website and landing pages can be very time-consuming. This is where website optimization and personalization platforms can help supercharge your inbound marketing efforts.\n‍\nImagine leveraging data in your marketing automation platform to deliver a tailored customer experience for everyone that comes to your website. You know what ads they’ve interacted with, emails they’ve engaged with, and events or webinars they’ve attended- why not use that data through integrations to help convert them to paying customers when they visit your website?\n‍\nHere are some of the top platforms and solutions to leverage for personalization and optimization.\n‍\nTop Website Optimization and Personalization solutions:\nMutiny- No-code AI conversion platform that creates personalized experiences\nAct-On- Delivers scalable personalization and optimization through powerful marketing automation functionality\nHotJar- Provides data and insight into what is helpful to your audience, and what isnt, allowing for faster A/B testing on your website.\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nImportant.\n‍\nSocial Media Management\n‍\nWhile it depends on your target persona and marketing strategy, you’ll likely be leveraging social media marketing as part of your strategy. And if you’re leveraging social media to support your marketing strategy, you’ll find it can be painful to manually manage communications and marketing content across LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and more.\n‍\nEnter social media marketing platforms. They enable you to compose, schedule, and distribute content across all social media platforms in one view. They can also provide you with analytics across all your social media platforms in near real-time, enabling you to make quick, data-driven decisions for your business.\n‍\nTop Social Media Management solutions:\nHootsuite\nSprout Social\nAgorapulse\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nImportant. More important if social media is a key part of your marketing strategy.\nAccount-Based Marketing (ABM)\n‍\nBefore we start, what is Account Based Marketing? Or ABM? Account Based marketing is a marketing strategy to focus efforts around specific accounts instead of your target market as a whole. Examples could be executing personalized marketing campaigns specific to that account, coordinating with your sales team to conduct a joint marketing and sales blitz, building custom-tailored content for those accounts, or all of the above. It’s a strategy that’s typically deployed to acquire logos over $100k in value, as the unit economics don’t necessarily work out if your average deal size is smaller.\n‍\nIf account-based marketing is part of your strategy, you know it can be challenging to manage and create these hyperpersonal campaigns in a scalable way. That’s where ABM platforms come into the picture- they help you manage all these channels across the board for an individual account. They also help alert you or your sales team when you have website visitors from your target accounts that show buying intent.\n‍\nTop Account-Based Marketing Solutions:\nDemandBase\nMetadata\n6sense\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nImportant if your average deal size is large.\n‍\nCustomer Loyalty and Gifting\n‍\nAs we head into 2023 with an unstable economic environment, customer retention has never been more critical. It’s no surprise that Customer Marketing roles are becoming more and more common as companies need to continually market the value of their products and services to help improve customer and revenue retention. One tactic that can be effective, but is often overlooked, is simply showing gratitude to your customers. Celebrating THEIR milestones as they continue to use your product and services is another fantastic way to strengthen your relationship with your customers.\n‍\nEnter Customer Loyalty and Gifting solutions. These solutions integrate directly into your CRM or Marketing Automation Platform and can be triggered to send your customer (or prospect) a gift automatically. In addition, marketing and sales teams can leverage these tools as part of their Account Based Marketing campaigns.\n‍\nTop Customer Loyalty and Gifting Solutions:\nLoop & Tie\nAlyce\nPostal\n‍\nLevel of importance:\nImportant if you’re focusing on customer retention.\n‍\nNice To Have Technology\nChatbots\n- It’s very likely your Marketing Automation Platform has a built-in solution for chatbots. Still, if you need more flexibility or customization, tools like\nQualified\nshould be considered.\n‍\nCalendar Schedulers-\nSimilar to chatbots, your Marketing Automation Platform likely has some solution already, but if you need more automation tools or routing abilities, tools like Calendly and Chili Piper should be considered.\n‍\nAnalytics Tools-\nOver time, you will have a large amount of data to analyze and outgrow your current reporting tools and capabilities. Whether that's attribution modeling, AI analytics, or automated forecasting tools, a wide range of solutions can support your needs.\n‍\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops! Something went wrong.\nB2B Marketing Tech Stack- Conclusion\n‍\nThere is much to consider when selecting your tech stack. The most important thing is understanding the marketing strategy your CMO or marketing leader puts in place and prioritizing your B2B marketing tech spend and time around those priorities.\n‍\nAnd remember,\nsoftware and tools don’t generate revenue- strategy and process do\n. Marketing technology only enhances current strategies and methods. If you have BAD processes or a bad strategy, these tools will only worsen things.\n‍\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/b2b-marketing-tech-stack\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

Your brand's first impression can sway viewers' perception of your company for better or worse.\nOn24's webinar platform is customizable, but branding is limited and the UI/UX is outdated.\nWelcome improves your brand perception by giving you the tools to create stunning presentations with your brand identity. Welcome Studio features an array of capabilities like Stage Kit, a portfolio of ready-made branded assets like static and animated backgrounds, name tags, Q&A prompts, and countdown clocks and Agenda Builder, the tool that gives you the ability to drag and drop sessions and assets to quickly build your event's run of show. Welcome also offers a Green Room, a private backstage area for speakers and hosts, all features missing in On24.\nLike Welcome, On24 does have the ability for producers to add Call-to-Action buttons for an added cost but they’re either formatted as a pop up or in the side panel. Welcome’s state of the art CTA Overlays are clickable so attendees can continue down the buyer’s journey directly from the presentation or the CTA pinned to chat.\nIf you’re struggling with antiquated webinar software, like On24, our platform will inject some much-needed energy into your brand. With plenty of customization options and modern designs, you'll create stunning branded content that stands out from the crowd.\nWelcome vs On24: Engagement Features\nWelcome is the ultimate webinar platform for engagement. Not only does it turn passive attendees into active participants, but with features like anonymous Q&A and question upvoting, everyone has a chance to be heard.\nBetween the two platforms, Welcome is the only one that allows attendees to join the conversation by virtually raising their hands, and being invited up on stage.\nOn24 does have chat, but doesn’t have the advanced chat options Welcome does. From chat reactions, pinned chat to GIFs, attendees and speakers won’t miss a beat of great dialogue.\nBoth platforms have breakout rooms but Welcome has branded photo booth options and networking opportunities like 1:1 video calling.\nWelcome vs ON24: Post-Event Features\nOn average,\n30% of your webinar views\nhappen after your webinar wraps, meaning there is a huge opportunity for post-event content. Welcome is the only webinar platform that allows you to generate branded short-form video clips from your event. Unlike traditional webinar platforms like On24, Welcome enhances event outreach and boosts views of on-demand videos through short-form content.\nBoth platforms have analytics capabilities, however, Welcome gives producers a whole other level of insight – an ‘event report card’ that reveals the true engagement and reception from attendees. This is key to making sure all events are successful!\nWelcome vs ON24: pricing\nWelcome’s pricing\nis transparent and our Pro and Enterprise tiers allow you to run as many webinars or events as you need whereas On24 may limit the number of events, registrants, or attendees based on your package. Because there is no public pricing for On24 you’ll need to contact sales to understand any On24 pricing.\nWelcome’s pricing is based on feature sets (integrations, unique attendees per event limits, multitrack events, Welcome Studio, etc). On24’s pricing depends on products added, seats, and feature sets.\nAll Welcome pricing packages\ninclude access to support, our resource hub, and have a self-serve onboarding option at no additional cost\nWelcome, the best webinar and event software\nRun great webinars and virtual events, right in your browser\nBook a demo\nStep 1\nCreate\nReady to take your virtual events from boring webinars to jaw-dropping experiences? Welcome Studio gives everyone the opportunity to create immersive and engaging content - no design skills needed!\nWelcome makes it a breeze to manage every aspect of your webinar. From organizing and promoting, all the way to analyzing success – you can do it all in one user-friendly platform.\nStep 2\nEngage\nFeeling like your audience is operating on autopilot? Welcome them to the conversation and active participation with cutting- edge engagement tools.\nStep 3\nAnalyze\nWelcome will unlock the secrets behind your events and campaigns. With our in-depth analytics, you'll get a full picture of just how much ROI they're giving you - no more guesswork. The Dashboard, Engagement Report Card and UTM Tracking give you all the data on performance to help make sure every event or campaign is a success.\nLoved & trusted\n\"We chose Welcome because it’s intuitive, beautifully designed, and made for attendee interaction, making it the perfect way to uplevel our experiences.

Before we dive into trends, let's ground ourselves as to what content marketing actually is. In short, content marketing is the creation and distribution of ANY form of content that would resonate with a company's target persona or ideal customer profile with the goal of generating brand awareness or educating the buyer.\n‍\nWhen thinking about your content marketing strategy, you need to consider three things:\nWill the messaging of my content resonate with the target audience?\nWhat content format should I use?\nWhat channels should I distribute the content through?\n‍\nContent & Messaging\nIt’s critical that the messaging of your content resonates with your target audience. Without clear messaging, it does not matter what format your content is or how well you distribute the content. You’ll be wasting time, money, and effort without first nailing this. The best way to get your messaging right is simple - have conversations with your target audience and decision-makers. Listen to the words they use, how they describe their current pains, and ask for feedback on the content you’re planning on creating.\n‍\nThere are a few ways to quickly test the messaging of your content, but it depends on your situation:\nIf buyers are already aware of your brand and you have some form of a following, posting on social media is a great way to see how your content will resonate (assuming your audience is on social media).\nIf your buyers are NOT on social media, and you have a large enough email database, email marketing is a great way to test your content for no cost.\nIf you have a high volume of website traffic to your site already, you can do A/B testing on your messaging on specific landing pages.\nIf you have none of the above, paid advertising such as LinkedIn Paid Ads or Google Search Paid Ads can give you quick insights.\n‍\nContent Format\nThere is a limit to the types of content formats you have at your disposal but choosing the right format can have major impacts. For example, short-form video typically performs 2-3x better than any other format on LinkedIn when it comes to impressions and engagement. But maybe your buyer doesn’t like video and prefers lengthy educational content- in that case, short-form may not have any material impact. So what are the forms of content you should consider? See some examples below:\n‍\nLong-form video\nWebinar or virtual event\nWebinar recording\nEducational videos\nProduct demonstrations\nTraining videos\nShort-form video\nClip of a conversation on a webinar\nPromo videos\n“How-to” videos\nProduct feature demonstrations\nLong-form text\nBlogs\nEducational landing pages\nIndustry reports\nCase studies\nShort-form text\nQuotes\nConversation summaries\nAudio\nPodcasts\nClips from podcasts\nVisual\nImages\nGraphics\nInfographics\nContent Distribution\nYou’ve nailed your messaging, and you’ve created content in what you believe to be the best format, now it's time for distribution. But how do you know where to distribute your content? If you’re continually having conversations with your target audience you should know WHERE they consume content. It’s also important to also nail down the FREQUENCY of content distribution for each of these marketing channels to avoid your marketing campaign from coming off as spammy or annoying. Below are some examples of distribution channels:\n‍\nEmail\nDirect Mail\nSocial Media Platforms (ex. LinkedIn)\nPaid Search\nPaid Ads\nWebsite\nSearch Engine Results (naturally, content impacts SEO)\nPodcasts Apps\nVirtual events/webinars\nIn-person events\nCommunities\nTelevision\nRadio\n‍\n‍\nContent Marketing Strategy Example Table\n‍\nContent Marketing Trends\nHeading into 2023, some new content marketing trends are emerging in the B2B marketing space. While trends tend to come and go, some of these tactics and strategies are bearing fruit for many organizations and have a strong return on investment.\n‍\nShort-Form Video Content\nWith the rise of Youtube Shorts and Tiktok, short-form video is beginning to dominate as the number one content format in 2023. There are many new\nmarketing tools\nthat have made video content creation easier than ever before- allowing B2B companies, not just B2C, to create video content at scale. Many companies are taking advantage of\nrepurposing their long-form content\ninto many pieces of short-form content. They’re making it more interactive, high-quality, and yield big results. If you already have a\nwebinar or virtual event program\n, implementing short-form video content into your overall marketing strategy is a no-brainer.\n‍\nValue-Add Content\nCreating content that immediately provides value to B2B buyers is becoming more and more common- and for good reason. Today’s B2B buyer is doing a lot of research on their own before ever requesting a product demo or making a purchase decision. They have a problem and want a solution.  But sometimes they don’t NEED your product, or any product, but rather just an answer or some guidance. This is where value-add content comes in. Providing potential customers with answers, guidance, strategies, and ideas is still valuable to them. Over time your buyer will associate your product or company as a trusted source and leader in the space so that when they DO have a problem your solution solves, you’ll be first on the list for them to evaluate.\n‍\nInteractive Content\nInteractive content has always existed but new technologies are taking it to a whole new level. Digital marketing teams are now building hyper-engaging experiences for their target audience - interactive product demos and self-guided tours, business calculators, and moving content from a PDF to a dynamic landing page. All of these examples allow a company to tell a more robust story about its product and how it can help solve the buyer's problem. Organizations that have the resources to focus their marketing efforts here have seen many of their performance metrics improve (time on page, conversion rates, acquisition costs, etc).\n‍\nWrap-Up\nThere are still some marketing trends from last year that are continuing to grow, such as influencer marketing, but for 2023 interactive content, value-add content, and short-form video content will be the trends that grow the most and likely what sets apart B2B brands and organizations. As mentioned above, before trying any of these marketing strategies or trends, make sure you deeply understand who your buyer is, what they care about, and nail your messaging.\n‍\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/b2b-content-marketing-trends\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

Even more difficult, is enforcing brand consistency since most employees aren’t designers.\nBrand guidelines make sure that anyone creating content for your business will stay on-brand. This means colors and logos all look the same. However, we know that even if an organization has brand guidelines to adhere to, it can still take a considerable amount of time and design resources to brand all your events within a virtual event platform.\nThat is until we released this evolution of stage kit! We’re helping the bottleneck in the content creation process by allowing users to easily brand their live events with pre-made elements, layouts, name tags, and backgrounds (animated and static).\nWhat makes this so special?\n‍\nIt’s on-brand.\nThis one is a bit self-explanatory, but your whole organization can maintain brand consistency easily without putting in the extra effort. Every background, countdown, transition, and name tag will have your brand colors. Automatically.\n‍\nIt’s resourceful.\nIt saves time & design resources by using branded assets already built within the Welcome Platform.\n‍\nIt’s simple.\nPre-made design elements allow you to spin up professional-looking events quickly.\n‍\nIt’s non-designer friendly.\nIt allows everyone in the organization, not just designers, to create beautiful on-brand events with ease.\nThe Details\n‍\nBranded Name Tags\nDo name tags matter? Of course! Adding graphics to your live stream adds a certain level of polish and professionalism to your content. Name tags introducing your speakers or lower-thirds providing information for what’s happening on-screen is crucial for context-setting. Welcome now auto-populates name tags with your brand colors, so when your speakers hit the stage, they’re name is immediately displayed.\n‍\n‍\nBranded Q&A Prompts\nThe ability for the audience to ask questions throughout the event or meeting is an expected feature and one that most virtual event platforms have. However, Welcome takes a unique approach and offers a more personal experience that closely emulates an in-person question and answer exchange where attendees can be brought on-stage to ask questions. Stage Kit 2.0 now takes Q&A a step further by offering branded Q&A prompts that display the audience’s questions in your brand colors and templated background.\n‍\n‍\nBranded Animated & Static Backgrounds\nAnother way to get a consistent brand look is to standardize the background behind your speakers. The updated Stage Kit includes animated and static backgrounds that use your brand’s primary colors. Now, you can select from a variety of different options that will be automatically displayed during your event.\n‍\nBranded Countdown Clocks\nLetting the audience know exactly when the event will start and when the next session will begin are two situations where a session timer comes in handy. Use the branded timers to set countdown times and easily drop them into the run-of-show to give the audience a heads up on when your event will begin or create buffers between sessions.\nOr use them as transitions between sessions or at the end of your event.\nGet Started with Stage Kit 2.0\nIf you’re a Welcome customer you can start auto-branding your virtual events and meetings today.

To do this, you not only need accurate analytics, but you also need the ability to understand the analysis quickly.\nWith the new Analytics at a Glance Dashboard, your audience engagement and other data insights are visualized in a simple Event Report Card. Now, you can easily gauge how attendees received your event and what their true level of engagement was.\nSo, what kind of engagement indicators can you track? Analytics at a Glance captures:\nAverage time spent at the event\nAverage number of engagements per attendee\nConversion from invited to the event to engaged at the event\nBreakdown of how attendees engaged\nEngagement of attendees over time\nEngagement of attendees by session\nLet’s dig a little deeper to understand what this means for your events.\nSee how long attendees stay at your event\nWith the Event Report Card, you can now see the average time attendees spent at the event as well as their attendance over time. This metric helps event organizers understand at what point during the event attendees may have started to drop. It can also help you pinpoint which speakers resonated with your audience or what type of content was a miss.\nKnow when to introduce new methods of engagement\nNow you can also take cues from your event's engagement report to pump up participation and keep your attendees’ attention at just the right moment. A little extra effort in your next run of show could make a huge difference.\nIf you see a dip in engagement during a particular time period, try mixing up the run of show by inserting a\nreal-time poll\n, encouraging audience participation in the chat, bringing an audience member on stage, or breaking out attendees into smaller groups to encourage meaningful discussion.\nUse the engagement report to your advantage and pinpoint where your event could use some extra love.\nDetermine which session was most successful\nThe session engagement data tells you how many people attended a unique session and the level of the session's engagement.  When looking at this data, you can get a good idea of which sessions or speakers resonated the most with the audience and which resonated the least. Digging deeper into the chat, Q&A, and polling analytics can still be done, but the Engagement Over Time Session Data is a great place to quickly see how sessions performed overall.\nThen use this data strategically during post-event follow-ups. Highlight top sessions and presenters in emails and think about creating a follow-up asset or webinar on the most popular topic or product discussed. Going forward, use your best engagement numbers as your benchmark targets for your next event.\n‍\nMeasure overall event success\nIn the world of virtual events, the ability to captivate your audience is the cornerstone of a successful event. Luckily, with Analytics at a Glance, all the engagement metrics you care about are collected in an easily digestible report.\nIn addition to audience engagement, the report captures conversions throughout the event funnel. Now you can see how many attendees you invited, how many registered, how many attended, and how many engaged in one simple bar chart.\nTrack these metrics for every event to establish a benchmark and see changes in your performance over time. You’ll discover exactly what kind of content is hitting the mark with your crowd.\nAbout Welcome\nFrom event analytics to our state-of-the-art production studio, Welcome’s features add up to a truly exceptional virtual experience platform. Our all-in-one platform works seamlessly for an event of any size and delivers meaningful engagement and data-backed results—all while looking stunningly beautiful.

Welcome just released two awesome new features that help extend the connection with your audience beyond the webinar — CTA Overlays and CTA Pinned Cards. These new additions compel attendees to take action with your content or get in touch with you at the click of a button. Read on to learn how these features enhance engagement with prospective customers and help steer them closer toward conversion.\nCTA Overlays\nWhen we say Welcome provides an\nunmatched attendee experience\n, we mean it. CTA Overlays offer an entirely new way to create and display call-to-action buttons that encourage engagement, get noticed,\nand\nlook sleek.\nYou can use two different types of CTA Overlays in your presentation.\nCreate eye-catching CTA buttons or scannable QR codes to encourage attendees to take action. Showcase your valuable resources—from case studies to product brochures and make it simple for attendees to demo or sign up for upcoming events. Whether your attendees are in the awareness, consideration, or decision stage of the buyer's journey, use this new feature to create the appropriate call to action. Check out some examples below:\nCustomizing Your CTA\nForget about basic CTA buttons, this new feature allows you to tailor each CTA for maximum impact. Customize your CTAs from placement and color to whether the desired destination is a link or just an intent signal to follow up with the attendee after the show.\nCTA Pinned Cards\nOnce your CTA Overlay pushes to the stage, Welcome will automatically display your CTA in the Public Chat in a card format. Producers can pin the CTA Card to Chat, making it easy to find throughout the webinar and giving your attendees two different ways to interact with your content or contact form.\nCTA Analytics\nAdding your CTA to the stage is the first part; next, you want to be able to track the clicks. Without analytics, producers would be left in the dark trying to decipher event data and attendee intent signals. All CTA data, whether displayed as an overlay or pinned card in Chat, is captured and shown in your Event Dashboard Analytics – making every click and conversion easily tracked.\nThe point of your CTA is to get noticed, and drive conversions, so don't settle for basic CTA functionality. Increase conversions and ROI from your webinars and encourage attendees to take the next step in the buyer's journey. Easily understand your audience's interests and intent using our state-of-the-art CTA capabilities. Plus, they look pretty slick, right?\nGet started\nFor Welcome customers, CTA Overlays are now available in\nStage Kit\n.

Having completed a morning of back-to-back Zoom meetings, they’ve only got 5 minutes to refill their coffee cup and respond to lingering Slack messages before settling back in their seat. Just in time for\nyet\nanother virtual happening. In this case, a webinar they’d forgotten they’d signed up for weeks ago. Or maybe it’s the stale company all-hands meeting that occurs every seven days without fail.\nIn an ideal world, you’d have your attendee’s full and undivided attention: eyes directed straight toward the screen, ears absorbing every single word with vested interest. But more realistically, they might be toggling between tabs or mindlessly checking their LinkedIn notifications while checking back on the event from time to time. Zoom fatigue is real, after all. So what can you do to keep your attendee engaged?\nA virtual gathering with zero interaction is a recipe for disaster—no different from an in-person event. After pouring countless hours into planning the heck out of your event and doing the hard work of getting your attendees there, it’s your job, now, to hold their attention. We’ve got a few ideas for how you can do just that. Here are some exercises you can use to inject energy during the right moments, depending on the kind of event you’re hosting.\nAll-hands & team meetings: Bring people closer together\nThere’s a reason why so many companies host regular employee-wide gatherings, commonly known as \"all-hands\" or \"town halls.\" Even if every possible update could be distilled into a single email blast, there’s nothing quite like hearing directly from folks across the team to create a greater sense of connection to the company and mission. Turning your all-hands into an event that employees actually look forward to, however, requires a bit of extra thought and magic. Here are some of the activities we’ve done in our own weekly all-hands to shake things up.\nTry these activities:\nWhose [blank] is this?\n— This one requires a bit of preparation before-hand. Before the meeting, ask team members to send you a picture of their work setup. Then pull the photos up on-screen and take turns guessing which workspace belongs to who. You could do the same thing with baby photos, pictures of pets, or even snapshots of your lunch.\nNew hire intros —\nHave each new hire prep an answer to a fun question (e.g. “if you could have dinner with anyone dead or alive, who would it be and why?”), then bring them on stage during all-hands to share their response. If you’re at a larger company, ask new employees to send short videos with their answers then play the pre-recorded videos live during the meeting, just to make the process a little smoother. You could even play a game of \"two truths and a lie\" by putting up a poll and getting others to ferret out the lie.\nDance break\n— At a recent Welcome all-hands, the marketing team decided to launch into a surprise flash mob at the close of their share and dance the Cupid Shuffle, encouraging everyone else to get up on their feet along with them. Take a page out of our book and dance it out! Get your blood flowing and snap your team out of drowsiness.\nFlash mob: the Welcome crew doing the Cupid Shuffle at a recent all-hands\nConferences & summits: Keep up the energy\nIf you’re running a multi-session, hours-long event, it’s even more crucial to bake moments of connection and delight into your agenda. Otherwise, attendees will eventually drift away in search of more stimulation or leave feeling utterly drained.\nTry these activities:\nVirtual jukebox\n— At the start of the event, set up a musical waiting room. Ask attendees to throw their song requests into the Q&A and tell them to upvote their favorite songs. Play the top-voted songs as the audience awaits the start of the event.\nPop in a poll\n— Use\npolls\nto make sure attendees are actually paying attention and retaining your content. Ask questions that tie back to the content of the session, or throw on a fun trivia game to create a sense of light-hearted competition.\nFind some zen\n— This might be the easiest (and most appreciated) exercise of them all. Thread wellbeing and mindfulness into your event by leading attendees through a calming breathing exercise that helps relieve any stress or anxiety they might be holding onto. Here's a simple one: Start by sitting back in your seat and closing your eyes. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for five counts, then slowly exhale through the nose. Do this a few more times.\nAct as your event's DJ by taking audience song requests. If your attendees need a break, why not ask them to take a quick walk?\nWorkshops & trainings: Find common ground\nWorkshops are a great opportunity to stimulate minds, make things a little more hands-on, and even get introspective. Tap into those benefits by introducing energizers to break the ice and create connections between participants (whether they know each other or not).\nTry these activities:\nGIF it up\n— Kick off the event by inviting participants to describe their current mood in the form of a GIF. Ask them to drop their GIF of choice into the chat.\nShow and tell\n— Get everyone to take a minute to find an object around them (could be anything from a book lying on their desk to a cool-looking vase) that represents them, in any capacity. Have participants go around explaining why they chose their artifact and how it reflects who they are.\n‍\nSpeed drawing\n— Ask your participants to grab a pen and piece of paper. Then give them five minutes to draw a particular scene, whether it be an abstract depiction of themselves, their “happy place”, or a joyful moment from the weekend. Have them share their artistic creations with the group.\nOur GIF of choice: the feeling when you know it's gonna be a good event\nWe hope you can put these exercises into action during your next virtual event to bring the energy to new levels. And remember: While fun and excitement are two qualities any attendee would eagerly seek in a virtual gathering, for an event to really stick, you need to\ntie the content back to the event’s purpose\n. Find ways to connect even the simplest warm-up activity to your main purpose to make the event truly meaningful.\nAbout Welcome\nFrom our interactive polling feature to our state-of-the-art production studio, each of Welcome’s features add up to provide a truly exceptional virtual experience platform. One that not only works seamlessly for an event of any size, but delivers meaningful engagement and data-backed results—all while looking stunningly beautiful.

They’re frequently used to keep attendees engaged, kickstart conversations, and offer some levity in between long sessions. But executing it well the virtual space is an entirely separate challenge in itself. We’ve seen boxy square polls on Zoom calls that pop up right on top of the speakers’ faces, forcing you to slide them out of the way, or the opposite: detached polls that steal valuable attention away from the main event.\nThese scenarios make it feel like the polls are just an ancillary feature, instead of something that’s intentionally embedded in the run of show. Isn’t it time for a better virtual polling experience?\nIntroducing Polling\nEnter: Welcome’s new integrated polling feature. This isn’t just your run-of-the-mill opinion-recording instrument. We’ve created a seamless polling tool that can be brought to and voted on the same stage that your event is on—making your poll the star of the show (at least while it’s on stage), rather than a mere accessory. All in real time. All on the same interface.\nMoments of connection shouldn't be left up to chance. Every part of your run-of-show can either facilitate or inhibit engagement, and polling is a powerful way to let your attendees\nparticipate\nin your event rather than just spectate. It can also be used throughout your event to capture valuable data, including engagement touchpoints, audience participation, and real-time event feedback.\n‍\nAn engaging event is a memorable one. When you see your audience engage by voting on a poll and reacting to the results in chat, you know they’re feeling less like they’re sitting in a room alone and more like they’re participating in an unforgettable shared experience.\nHere’s what you should know about polls on Welcome.\nNo more boring white boxes. The background color can be set to match your brand, and you even have the option to add in images right next to the poll.\nDesigning a poll takes minutes. All you need is a question and up to ten multiple-choice answers.\nUp to four speakers can be shown on stage, right next to the poll.\nYou can hide results or choose to share them in real time by going into the producer settings. If shared with attendees, they will see the results change dynamically as more responses come in.\nInsert pre-recorded videos: Say you’re pop-quizzing attendees about movies. You can slot in a clip from a movie to offer some more context.\nYou can access polling data directly in the analytics dashboard after the event, from the number of votes to the attendees' individual answers—all broken down by question.\nPolls in the control room\nHow you can use polling\nWhether you’re producing an annual marketing conference for the masses or looking to inject some excitement into your weekly all hands meeting, polls can be used in a myriad of ways to engage your audience.\nQuiz your attendees to make sure they’re actually paying attention and retaining your content.\nThere’s no time like the present to capture valuable (and immediate) feedback. If you’re an event producer, you know how crucial it is to get feedback from as many attendees as possible. Throw on a poll during the event to help you polish up your session as you go, or right at the end to improve future events.\nGet a pulse of your audience—who they are, their roles, goals for the event, and topics they’re most excited about—and use that information to guide the direction of your event.\nUse polls to break the ice and inject humor, during and in between sessions. Plan a trivia game to add a little light-hearted competition among attendees or kick off your weekly team meeting with a game of “two truths and a lie” to get to know your colleagues better.\nAbout Welcome\nFrom our interactive polling feature to our state-of-the-art production studio, each of Welcome’s features add up to provide a truly exceptional virtual experience platform. One that not only works seamlessly for an event of any size, but delivers meaningful engagement and data-backed results—all while looking stunningly beautiful.

More\nthan half of marketers\nwho responded to the 2021\nDemandGen Report\nsurvey said that webinars are the top-of-funnel content that delivers more leads than any other type of content.\nBut did you know that webinars work just as well at other customer journey stages, too? From building awareness to creating happy customers, webinars help you:\nBuild credibility and expertise in your niche.\nDevelop meaningful relationships with leads.\nEducate highly qualified leads about the benefits of your product.\nSupport new customers with onboarding tips and tricks. This way, they'll get the most out of your product—and stick around for longer.\nNurture customer relationships by keeping existing customers happy and engaged with your brand.\nHere are the 12 types of webinars you should host at every stage of the customer journey, so you can make the most out of a content format that delivers.\n‍\nWebinars to Host at the Awareness Stage\nHere's where webinars shine. Like your other content marketing efforts, webinars build awareness of your brand. Because they're such a great way to develop leads, awareness webinars are perfect for delivering thought leadership content that connects with future customers.\nThought leadership webinars showcase your brand's stance on relevant topics to your ideal customer. Your webinar should move the conversation forward, provide evidence to support your claims, and offer tactical solutions to a real challenge.\nRemember:\n70% of B2B professionals\nseek tips, tricks, and best practices from webinar content. Thought leadership is a great way to establish your company as a leader in the field, all while educating and inspiring your audience and giving them the insider knowledge they crave.\nTo broaden your reach and generate more leads, consider partnering with a like-minded brand partner, an industry influencer, or an entire panel of industry leaders to deliver webinars. These include:\nPartner Webinars:\nPartner with a like-minded organization or brand to deliver thought leadership content that piques prospective customers' curiosity or helps them to solve a problem.\nIndustry Influencer Webinar Webinars:\nTeam up with an industry influencer who shares your organizational values. Like a partner webinar, your content should focus on prospective customers' needs and challenges.\nIndustry Panel Webinars:\nA great way to host a roundtable discussion with other industry leaders or to take listener questions in an \"ask me anything\" (AMA) format.\nEach of these webinar formats helps you own a topic and boost SEO, which will enable more prospective customers find you through organic search. By partnering with other organizations or influencers, you'll also extend your reach and gain exposure to their audiences. This mutually beneficial relationship is a great way to develop exciting content, forge new relationships with like-minded brands, and find new customers.\nWebinars to Host at the Consideration Stage\nOnce you've captured a lead's attention, it's time to nurture them through the sales pipeline and move them closer to the decision-making stage.\nWebinar formats at the consideration stage include:\nCase Study Webinars:\nDemonstrate how your product has worked for an existing customer. This webinar format works like a live testimonial. Be sure to focus on a topic or case study that also centers on the primary challenges, pain points, or needs of your prospective customers.\n59% of your B2B audience\nis actively looking for case study content to shed light on their problems. Why not deliver this helpful deep dive in the form of a webinar?\n‍\nWorkshop Webinars\n: This format is a little more time intensive and works best with highly qualified leads. To get feedback or help in solving a challenge during the webinar, webinar attendees must submit questions or work samples ahead of time. Is networking or community a major part of your brand presence? Workshop webinars can be a great format to showcase any existing community or networking infrastructure you have.\n‍\nReport Summary Webinars:\nBuild off your existing content marketing efforts by developing a webinar around published reports, market trends, or white papers. This can be a great, easily digestible format for leads who are curious about your research but may not have hours to dedicate to reading a full report.\nEven though you'll have plenty of time to discuss the particular benefits of your product, these webinars should still be educational and support your leads' real challenges. It's a way to showcase how well you understand the customers who use your product—and why you're the right fit for the leads in the room.\nWebinars to Host at the Decision-Making Stage\nAs leads make final decisions about your product, they want to see how well it works. They may also be comparison or price-shopping between your product and another. Now is the time to show off everything your product can do and why they should invest in your solution to solve their challenges.\nWebinars are the perfect way to demo your product or provide a memorable experience that turns a lead into a customer. This includes:\nProduct Demo Webinars:\nShowcasing your product benefits helps leads imagine themselves in the driver's seat. Even better? Open up the floor to a question-and-answer session.\n67% of webinar attendees want a Live Q&A session\nwith the speakers—no matter where they are in the marketing funnel.\n‍\nExperiential Field Events:\nWith a bit of planning, immersive experiences and experiential field events can be done well in a virtual format. Engage your prospect's senses with hands-on activities, executive dinners, or roundtables accelerating sales and bringing your deals across the finish line.\nWhether you need to answer final questions before your prospect signs on the dotted line or show them a good time, webinars convert leads into happy customers. Just don't forget to send along any relevant marketing materials after the event is over.\nLeads are 60x more likely to convert\nonce they receive that final packet of information.\n‍\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops! Something went wrong.\nWebinars to Host at the Conversion Stage\nCongrats!

By providing easy access to onboarding content or explaining new features, you'll turn a first-time customer into a long-term advocate.\nConsider hosting webinars like:\nOnboarding Webinars:\nDeveloping product-specific educational content that gets new customers up and running quickly.\nCustomer Appreciation Events:\nKeep customers happy by offering them delightful perks, access to special content, or opportunities to connect with one another.\nProduct Roadmaps:\nGet customers excited about new developments in your product by showcasing where your brand is heading next.\nNew Feature Launches:\nEnsure that customers get the most out of a new feature by developing webinar content to support them every step of the way.\nYou worked hard to win over prospects and close deals, which is why your work doesn't stop once your lead converts.

Companies are now utilizing the technology to its full potential to reach a global audience and engagingly deliver information.\nIf you've been working remotely for a while, you've discovered that staying alert and engaged the whole time is challenging. Marketers swear by webinars, and as more companies clamor to host them, people have become inundated with invitations to attend.\nSo, how do you make your virtual event stand out? Here's a list of webinar engagement ideas to help increase attendee participation and leave your audience with a lasting impression.\nZooming out of Zoom\nWhile Zoom has undoubtedly been a game-changer, especially during the pandemic, many people are now experiencing\nZoom fatigue\n. Staring at the same screen for hours upon hours for work, classes, talking with friends and family, and even therapy sessions have taken a mental toll on most people.\nConcentrating is increasingly tricky when our brains rely only on verbal information. It's very similar to how you'd listen to your teacher drone on in class in the background while your mind is elsewhere. In this case, it's even worse because no one will call you out for it.\nTo combat the fatigue many are feeling, it's crucial to rethink the whole interface of webinars with more interactivity.\nStart the webinar strong\nYour goal should be to create an anticipatory and fun atmosphere for your event, so you'll want to pump up your audience from the very start. Think of the beginning of the webinar as the previews that come before the movie at the theatre. This is where you pull all the stops. You can start the session with virtual games, which warm the participants up to actively engage throughout the session. You can also share pre-recorded hype videos or do virtual pub quizzes on the event's topic to get things started.\nChoose speakers with stage presence\nYour speaker will make or break the virtual event. It would be best if you had someone with charisma, energy, and confidence to capture and command the participants' attention. Yes, you have a thought leader, an influential person in your industry, but can they passionately convey valuable insights through the camera?\nMany industry leaders and experts could be well-versed in the topic. Still, your event will only stay energized if they can authentically communicate. Your audience can tell when there's an authentic connection, often through the speaker's tone, body language, gestures, and facial expressions.\nPeople don't just want to hear information about the speaker's knowledge and expertise; it would also be helpful to include tidbits about their personal journey. This helps to create an emotional connection and a synergy between the audience and the speaker.\nIf you have multiple speakers for an event, it's crucial to coordinate rehearsals and ensure harmony. Your speakers should interact comfortably with other participants, so the audience is not kept out of the loop.\nGo beyond the slide deck\nWhile slide decks have been a great way to introduce the visual component during presentations, there might be better ways to go for a virtual event. We're all familiar with the awkward moment as a speaker struggles to get their screenshare working so they can share a PowerPoint presentation.\nYou can go the other, more effective way, using\nbranded graphics\nto aid your presentation. Custom overlays, for one, will revolutionize your presentation. With overlays, rather than the attendees shifting their attention to reading slides, the speaker gets to present the content on screen alongside the audience. Overlays also help keep the content minimal so the focus remains solely on the speaker.\nThe bulk of the content should be presented through speech. Sometimes people get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information when the presenter overloads the slides, or they read them fast and zone out before the presenter gets to the main points.\nStage Kit\ngives you the tools and the power to create professional quality virtual events. Moreover, you get multiple engagement features built directly into the platform. You don't have to be an experienced designer to create beautiful on-brand virtual events. Anyone on your team can easily put together the branded assets on the platform.\n‍\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops! Something went wrong.\nBring attendees on stage for Q&A\nQ&A sessions make the event more interactive and more personal for the attendees. When they know that the presenter genuinely cares about what they take away from the event, they're more likely to be more engaged and more interactive.\nStandard webinar Q&As usually consist of webinar hosts answering audience questions in a one-directional manner. This is different from having an interactive Q&A session. Interactive Q&As are built into the event to help facilitate a bi-directional dialogue. Meaning you can invite an audience member on stage to ask their question face-to-face.\nInteractive Q&A is a lot better for your webinar. For one, the attendees won't feel like they're being talked at, as is often the case with virtual events. The presenter has all the information, while the participants passively consume what they say.\nWith interactive Q&A, the participants' input is valued and structured like an in-person question-and-answer exchange. As the event progresses, audience questions can be upvoted so the speaker addresses the most burning questions first.\nPlanning a webinar? Check out the\nWebinar Best Practices Guide\nto ensure your webinar program is a success!\nSwitch up the format\nOne of the major reasons webinars have become boring is we know what to expect. Most webinars feel dull because it's just 45 or 60 minutes of the speaker going on and on. Often, people find themselves distracted by social media or even shopping online while the meeting continues.\nRemember, distractions are only a click away, so what will hold your audience's attention?\nIncluding various formats is the best way to maximize attention and engagement. Don't just stick to speech and slides. Switch up the event's structure by interjecting a short video or two, polls, and bringing attendees on stage to ask questions.\nYou can also split the audience into breakout rooms where they'll engage in smaller group discussions. This can be a great way to get feedback from the audience to determine whether the event objectives are being met. As a best practice, avoid speaking for longer than 15 minutes without changing the format slightly.\nDeliver value\nPeople attend webinars to learn something useful.\n70% of B2B professionals\nwant to sharpen their skills with the latest tips, tricks, and best practices. Delivering value should be the first goal when preparing for your virtual event. Keeping your audience engaged is much easier when they find value in the information provided.\nPolls, videos, and virtual games are great, but the content is at the core of your event. What is the message you're trying to get across? Soft-selling is key. The consumer today is well-informed and wary of overt marketing tactics.\nAs such, the goal of your webinar should be to showcase how your product or service is the best solution to a problem they're facing around the webinar topic. Don't make the webinar all about your products and services, as your audience can see through it.\nProvide the audience with free resources throughout the webinar to help them further understand the webinar topic. This way, you position yourself as a thought leader, and they'll turn to you whenever they encounter problems that can be fixed with your product or service.\nMeasure engagement afterwards\nLike any other marketing tactic, you have to measure the return on investment of your events. This should be a continuous process of improvement that will drive growth for your brand. The conversations don't stop after the event is over. For further engagement, utilize the testimonials, top questions and their answers, and presentation summaries.\nTo measure engagement, you'll need accurate, timely analytics. With\nWelcome's Analytics at a Glance Dashboard\n, you can quickly gauge the actual level of engagement in your virtual events. The audience engagement and other essential data insights are visualized for you in an Event Report Card so you can highlight areas that need improvement.\nWe are a webinar platform dedicated to helping you host the best virtual even experiences that will drive revenue. Our tools and features are designed with engagement in mind to help you connect with your audience at every level.

Check out these best practices to capture your audience's attention—and hook them from the moment you step on the virtual stage. Here's everything you need to know about planning your webinar, from developing awesome content to driving engagement during the event itself. Let's dive in!\n8 weeks out\nTypes of Webinars for Every Stage of the Customer Journey\nTwo months from your ideal launch date is the best time to kick off your content planning and strategy session. The first thing discussed during your meeting should be what type of webinar you want to host. If you're scratching your head and wondering what your options are, here are 12 types of webinars you can host at every stage of the customer journey.\nHow to Choose a Topic for Your Audience\nSome of the best content comes from listening to your audience. Narrowing down your audience's pain points and needs is the first step to creating great webinar content. Understand what they're hungry to learn and what problems they're trying to solve.\nIf you're unsure what their problems are, conduct small-scale targeted research through polls and surveys by putting your email lists and social channels to good use. (Pro tip: Try LinkedIn's\npolling feature\nto gauge your audience's interests quickly.) You can even narrow your inquiries with event registrants—or ask your audience about a finer point live during the event!\nWorking from a broad topic to a narrow, audience-centered hook is often helpful. For instance, you might start with \"Webinar Best Practices\" and narrow it down to \"Double Your Webinar Conversion Rate!\" That is, as long as you can deliver on that promise. ;)\nTypical broad topics include:\nHow to solve common problems\nInsider industry know-how\nHow to learn a specific skill or understand a relevant new trend\nProduct deep dives\nTips for Choosing an Engaging Speaker\nYou don't want to grab any old speaker for your webinar. You need someone who can engage an audience and provide insights into their industry so they'll be interested in what you have to say!\nResearch\nshows that people form impressions about a speaker's competence in as little as 30 seconds. This means in less than a minute; attendees will decide whether your speaker is trustworthy and judge them based on their body language and vocal attributes.\nLook at these traits before deciding on a potential guest:\nKnowledgeable:\nThis person should know more than enough about the topic and keep up with trends within it.\nDynamic:\nThey should be able to deliver engaging content from the start till finish and add some sparkle where needed, like humor or creativity.\nCredible:\nEnsure this person is credible on the topic they're presenting so that attendees will trust what they're saying.\nConfident:\nThis person should be able to give the appearance of confidence and competence. Making eye contact, keeping an open posture, using gestures to reinforce key points, varying their pace as they speak, and not over-using filler words are just some characteristics of a confident speaker.\nWhile we all want to cultivate partnerships with like-minded brands to nab incredible webinar speakers, don't discount your team's expertise. Sometimes relevance and depth are better than an instantly recognizable name—especially if you have a topic bound to draw in registrants. (Remember the importance of credibility?)\nDevelop Supporting Content\nNurture your webinar leads by offering supporting content to engage with attendees during and after the event. Content could include downloadable assets (like guides) and the next event's invitations sent through email, social channels, or directly within the webinar itself.\n3-4 Weeks Out:\nTarget Your Audience\nWebinars are all about your audience, what they want to learn and how you can help. So make sure the copy in any email outreach or announcement reflects them.\nRemember to target the job titles, companies, or prospects who will benefit most from your content. Keep in mind the more you can personalize your invites with information you already know about them, the better your conversation rate will be.\nFind the Right Email Cadence\nNearly\n60%\nof webinar registrations come from email campaigns, so it's important to get it right. At a minimum, you'll need to send the following:\nA webinar outreach email\nA registration confirmation email\nAn event reminder (or three)\nA \"Thank you\" message\nA follow-up message with the webinar recording and any other assets you've prepared for attendees\nKeep an Eye on Registration Numbers\nTracking your campaign progress is a key part of successfully running a webinar. Understand if you're hitting your registration goals, and keep in mind that 54% of all webinar attendees sign up a week before you go live, so remember that last-minute push!\nIf your numbers are lower than you'd like, shake it up! Tweak your messaging or change your promotional channels. Small changes, like reducing fields on the registration form or asking a brand partner to conduct outreach, can make a big difference in webinar attendance.\nNeed more tips on webinar registration? Check out our article,\n\"How to Boost Registrations and Attendance To Your Webinars,\"\nfor expert ideas.\nPrep Your Speakers\nEnsure your guest speakers are prepped, ready, and comfortable in your\nvirtual green room\n. The more thoroughly speakers understand the run-of-show, the more relaxed and engaging they'll be during your presentation.\nPlanning a webinar? Download our\nFree Webinar Planning Template\nso you don’t miss a thing on your to-do list!\n‍\nHow to Promote a Webinar\nA question that gets asked often is, \"\nHow do I increase registrations to my webinar and get people to show up?\n\"\nHere are five tips to boost your webinar's registration.\nOptimize Your Webinar Registration Form\nOne key element often overlooked is the webinar registration form. It's the gateway to your virtual event, so show it some love. So what makes an optimized registration form?\nKeep it short\n. When it comes to form fields, less is more. According to\nHubSpot\n, the optimal number of fields to have are three. It's a balancing act between business needs and user experience, but gathering the least amount of information possible will reduce drop-off.\nUse smart fields.\nA great feature of marketing automation platforms like HubSpot is\nsmart fields\n. They keep your leads from doing unnecessary work by removing form fields previously submitted by a customer or prospect.\nDesign using a single-column layout\n. A single-column layout has\nbeen proven\nmore effective in driving conversions than multiple columns on the same page. They offer better flow, resulting in better UX.\nOptimize for mobile.\nDon't forget about mobile-friendly design when creating your form. Make form fields and submit buttons finger size (generally 44x44 is the best size). Limit the typing needed by using dropdown menus, radio buttons, auto-selected answers, and easy-to-read fonts.\nUse Quick Registration Links.\nIncluding Welcome's Quick Registration link in your promo emails, invitees can access your webinar via the link provided without filling out another form.\nAdd CTAs to Unexpected Areas\nOn average, up to 57% of webinar registrations come from email. It's a given that you'll add call-to-action buttons to email invites and social posts, but here are several other areas to add CTAs:\nAdd a CTA banner to your website\nLink a CTA to your email signatures\nPromote through your newsletters\nAdd a CTA for your next event during your current webinar\nMake sure to take stock of all your digital assets and think of innovative ways to get your message out.\nBuild a Virtual Events Page\nIf you consistently host webinars and other virtual events, it's important to have a designated events page where visitors can find all upcoming webinars and on-demand videos. Like Welcome's\nevent page\n, yours can serve as a repository for all your future planned events and enable you to capture new signups that may not already be in your marketing database. Better yet, by adding your past events as gated on-demand videos to the events page, you can continue to increase viewership long after the webinar wraps.\nPromote Your Event Up Until Showtime\nIf you want to ensure your webinar has a good turnout, it's critical that you keep promoting in the lead-up. While two weeks is standard practice to begin pre-event promotion, a whopping 29% of people register on the same day as their event. So keep spreading the word across all your marketing channels; fingers crossed, they'll quickly fill up with eager participants!\nAdd Partnerships to Your Webinar Strategy\nWant to take your promotion efforts twofold? Partnering up with like-minded brands will bring you even closer to success. Co-hosting a webinar is the perfect way for both businesses involved - plus, having twice as many people promoting it can boost those registrant numbers. Just ensure that expectations are managed and agreed upon— like who will get which pieces of the registrant list and emails, if a recording is shared in both channels, and when you send out those social media posts. It's best to avoid having surprises pop up to get the most out of each other's time and effort!\n‍\nHow to Boost Your Webinar's Attendance\nHalf the battle is getting people to sign up for your webinar; now, you need them to show up! Here are five tips to boost your webinar attendance.\nHost During Optimal Times and Days\nWhen you're planning a webinar, timing is everything. Aim to host your webinars mid-week and avoid Mondays and Fridays. Thursday reigns supreme as the most popular day for attending virtual events (\n26%\n), followed by Tuesdays (\n23%)\nand Wednesdays (\n21%\n). And when should your event start? Mid-morning seems to be preferred by\n28%\nof viewers, with\n27%\npreferring mid-afternoon – so aim for those time slots between Tuesday and Thursday!\nUse Email Reminders to Keep in Touch\nYou've worked hard to get people signed up for your upcoming webinar - and you don't want it to become a distant memory! Establish an email sequence that subtly reminds attendees of what's coming & why it matters. Don't overwhelm them with too many messages, or you might tempt them to hit unsubscribe; three reminders should do the trick.\nThe complete email cadence can look like this:\nPost-registration follow-up confirmation email\nFirst reminder: Sent 1 week from the webinar\nSecond reminder: Sent 1 day before the webinar\nThird reminder: Sent 1 hour before the webinar\nOn-the-fence reminder: Send your final promotional email on the day of the webinar to people who've opened previous emails but did not register\nFirst follow-up: \"Here's your recording!\"\nSecond follow-up: \"Additional resources\"\nThird follow-up: \"Future events\"\nDon't Forget About On-Demand Recordings\nEven when the curtain drops on your live event, remember those audience members who prefer to consume content at their own pace. People tend to be more engaged and interested in recordings they can watch whenever they like - so seize the opportunity. Not only will you increase headcount overall, but around\n30%\nof signups come from people watching the recorded version. In other words, if you make it available, people will attend.\nIncentivize Attendance\nTry taking some cues from the event world and start gifting to drive attendance. Like you would use swag for trade shows and industry event booths, gifts can also be integrated into virtual events, as evidenced by a 60% attendance rate Lessonly achieved when they sent Starbucks gift cards for a virtual coffee chat.\nEven though giveaways add to your bottom line, sending eGifts can be one of the most impactful things you can do to boost attendance.\nAlways Add Value to Keep Attendees Coming Back\nIt's more than just having the best webinar platform - it takes great content to draw people back in. If you want future visitors, prioritize actionable and educational content that provides valuable insights instead of turning your event into a big sales pitch! Up to 40% of return visitors have been reported by those who offer real value through their presentations – so give them what they need with tips, tricks & best practices galore.\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops!

Check out our list of innovative engagement ideas – guaranteed to have your attendees interacting, energized, and engaged!\nStart Strong From The Get Go\nSet the stage for a successful webinar by kicking off in high gear. Think about it like previews in a movie theatre - wouldn't everyone rather sit down and watch something fun than wait around? Build excitement with virtual games, pre-recorded hype videos, or even pub quizzes on your chosen topic – all designed to get things rolling right away!\nChoose a Stellar Speaker\nYour speaker is key to making your webinar captivating. Of course, they need to offer valuable insights about their trade - but that can only go so far.\nHow\nthey deliver these facts is equally as crucial: body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions must all play into their performance for people to fully engage. Plus, let us not forget those delightful stories of personal journeys sprinkled throughout the presentation; nothing quite warms hearts like an accompanying narrative!\nDitch the Slide Deck\nInstead of presenting run-of-the-mill slides, punch up your presentation with graphic overlays. Forget PowerPoint! Branded graphics are your perfect companion for introducing a new wow factor into virtual events. With overlays, you can keep your presentation content minimal yet super effective while keeping everyone's attention focused on YOU - not endless slides they have to read through (zzzzz).\nPro Tip: Don't have a graphic designer? Don't worry. With a bevy of engagement features and minimal design knowledge required, anyone on your team can create an unforgettable branded event with\nAgenda Builder\nand\nStage Kit\n! Cut down on overwhelm by ditching slides crammed full of text in favor of concise speeches that deliver all the info - no more zoning out for attendees!\nBring Attendees on Stage\nFoster a dynamic dialogue by inviting attendees on stage for Q&A. Instead of answering questions in the traditional one-directional manner, make it more personal with an interactive Q&A session. Get rid of the feeling that attendees are just being talked at by inviting audience members on stage to ask their burning questions face-to-face. Show them you genuinely care about what they take away from the event. After all, connection is key when trying to engage participants!\nMix up the Format\nKeep your audience from running off with their attention spans by switching up the format throughout your webinar. You can include exciting visuals such as videos or polls and get everyone involved through engaging activities like breakout rooms or an on-stage Q&A session. With this much variety at hand, you'll be holding onto the click of interest for hours rather than minutes!\nAs a best practice, avoid speaking for longer than 15 minutes without changing the format slightly.\nCaptivate Through Your Content\nKeep attendees engaged with captivating content that isn't heavy-handed on the sales pitch - let their problems drive you towards highlighting how your product or service provides the best solution instead of pushing it down their throats. Use CTA overlays or the Chat Box to sprinkle in some free resources.\n‍\nHow to Repurpose Webinar Content\nMany companies invest in creating a seemingly endless stream of content — often to little avail. But fret not! Quality will always beat quantity: instead of pushing more and more articles into the interwebs, repurpose your existing events materials; this way, you're guaranteed high-quality output without stretching resources too thin. Here are some creative solutions so that every team—big or small—can make it work.\nCreate Short-Form Content\nWith webinars being a virtual goldmine for rich, power-packed social media content - from video clips to infographics and insights, it's an amazing opportunity to give your brand marketing & outreach efforts the edge.\nWelcome is doing this by creating powerful mini-videos with great visuals that increase our events' engagement and keep all our channels synced up.\nWelcome\n4,384 followers\n2mo\nEdited\nInterested in uniting your sale and marketing teams?

It's like hitting three birds with one stone!\nTurn Audio into a Podcast\nDon't just stick to video content when it comes to your virtual event - audio recordings can also become valuable assets! Turn them into a full podcast episode or short sound clips, and you'll have a low-cost way of engaging with people through sound. Not only that, but you get the chance for even more creative storytelling opportunities too – who said podcasts don't need visuals?!\nBuild an On-Demand Video Library\n30% of event registrants\nprefer to watch webinar content after the live event. For a content marketer, this is an exciting equation. You can support these needs with an on-demand video library of all your event content.\nNot only can you improve your SEO with a landing page for each video, but landing pages with embedded forms or strong CTAs can also\nhelp your sales team capture more leads\n.\nPitch to an Industry Blog\nIt's time to expand your reach! Already an expert on the topic of your webinar? It's pitch-perfect for you to explore additional outlets and become a thought leader. Try pitching relevant opinion pages or industry blogs so that more readers can benefit from your expertise. The potential upside is immense - increased brand awareness, and solidified status as a thought-leader extraordinaire.\nCase Studies, Ebooks, and Other Major Assets\nWith some additional research and content strategy elbow grease, you could create:\nRelated blog content and a pillar page\n. Is your webinar content integral to your business model? Begin to own SEO on a specific search term by creating a\ntopic cluster\nof related blog posts and a longer\npillar page\n. Not only will this increase your organic traffic, but it will also bolster your brand's position as an expert in the space.\nA customer case study\n. Showcase how a customer or client uses your product to solve the challenges from your webinar with a customer case study. Case studies are great bottom-of-the-funnel content and can help boost product demonstration conversions or sales!\nA white paper\n. Dive deeper into the research related to your webinar topic to demonstrate your brand's understanding of related challenges and opportunities in your industry. While white papers are a bigger commitment in terms of time and resources, they can also be incredible assets for capturing leads or closing sales.\nUse event analytics and audience questions to develop new content and event ideas\nNot sure what to write about for your next blog post or your next topic for the upcoming webinar? Let event analytics and audience questions lead you in a new direction. Look at poll responses to understand what's top-of-mind with your viewers, and use that data to create new content or future webinars. On the flip side, look through those same analytics - watching where people are tuning out during live events or video replays. Take this information back in time and make tweaks, so everyone stays intrigued until (and even after) all eyes have left the screen!\nHow to Nurture Leads After a Webinar\nYour webinar was a hit - the chat was fire, and your Live Q&A session was fun and lively! So what do you do next to convert those viewers into motivated buyers? We have some tried-and-true tips for turning qualified leads into sales that enable success across teams.\nEmbed CTAs Into Your Presentation\nTo keep your buyers on the journey, you need to inspire them to act. Drive quality leads straight into sales by enchanting them with engaging webinar content and captivating CTAs. Your virtual event shouldn't just be informative; make sure it moves prospects along in that all-important sales funnel.\nA strong CTA will:\nCreate a sense of scarcity (like a limited-time offer or a two-for-one deal),\nor\nProvide your webinar attendees with something they\nreally\nwant (like your one-of-a-kind spreadsheet template or a product demo that makes their purchasing decision that much easier)\nAnd a great CTA might achieve both goals!\nConduct a Survey Before Attendees Leave\nTake advantage of the momentum and positive engagement by launching a\npost-event survey\nwithin Welcome. Conducting surveys before attendees leave the webinar, gives you valuable insight from your prospects about their buying intent—without having to wait for responses. Use that data to shape a winning strategy for sales success down the line.\nDon't risk attendees skipping over an email in their inbox one week later. Pose your most important questions as attendees head out the door, then integrate your survey responses into your customer relationship management (CRM) software to make demo and sales calls that much easier.\nFollow Up with Additional Content\nYour after-event outreach should be armed with more than just a thank you email—to give prospects an extra nudge towards conversion, include sales enabling assets too. From product feature breakdowns to checklists and templates, having marketing materials on hand can help start conversations between leads and your sales team for easier engagement down the line. Don't forget to share which files are being accessed so your sales team is in the loop and has an easy conversation starter with the prospect.\nMaximize Sales Conversations with CRM Integrations\nGive your sales team the perfect head start with integrations that capture attendee engagement, such as Q&A questions, polls they respond to, any assets they downloaded during the event, if they filled out a demo form, and other sales indicators. Your reps won't need fly-by introductions when hopping into calls; they'll be able to pick up a conversation right where your lead left off.\nCreate a Nurture Campaign\nNot all of your attendees are necessarily ready to take the plunge and book that product demo or commit to buying. To keep them interested until they're ready for more, provide helpful tips & tricks, engaging educational content, customer reviews, and case studies.\nWith an integrated CRM you'll have extensive insights into what drives engagement among attendees, so use those details to send more targeted content in your nurture campaign.\nWhether you send free assets or encourage leads to sign up for additional webinars, don't discount the power of a nurture campaign to build trust and confidence in your brand—and set your sales team up for future success.\nHow to Measure ROI of a Webinar\nIf measuring webinar ROI is challenging for your team, you're not alone.\n64% of B2B marketers\nsay their ability to demonstrate the value of their content marketing efforts is only average—or worse. You've put in a ton of hard work and dedication to ensure your webinars are well-attended, but it can still be challenging to prove their ROI without a solid foundation for analysis. By monitoring the right metrics, you'll have enough data evidence to show just how valuable these events are. From measuring lead quality, and attributing sales back to your efforts - getting those real returns won't seem like so much smoke and mirrors.\nHere are the four strategies you should implement to demonstrate the ROI of your webinars and virtual events:\nTrack the Source of Registrations\nIdentifying the channels that effectively bring in registrants for webinars is crucial to ensuring your marketing dollars are well-spent.\nUTM tracking codes\nare snippets of code in URLs that track which channel was the most effective in reaching—and converting—webinar registrants. With a bit of tracking-code sleuthing, you can find out exactly where your money was put best and plan accordingly. Make sure no URLs slip through the cracks so these cleverly crafted snippets do their job right!\nHosting a webinar comes with budget considerations, and no matter what size operation you're running, it's important to ensure every dollar is accounted for. Expenses can include:\nAdvertising costs, like paid ads or media.\nBoosting a Facebook post\nRunning a LinkedIn campaign\nSponsoring a blog post on a partner's website\nProduction costs also add up quickly. Here are a few to consider:\nDid you hire a graphic designer to make flawless slides?\nA video editor to help with post-production for on-demand services?\nEngage a production agency to help you manage run-of-show?\nThankfully,\nWelcome\ncan consolidate production costs. With in-platform tools for designing, editing, and hosting virtual events, we offer B2B marketers one way to save $$$ —and boost their ROI for every event.\nDetermine Lead Quality\nOne of the benefits of holding webinars is\ngenerating qualified leads\n. As soon as a lead registers for your event, you receive key details, including where they work or their role at a specific company. Depending on your webinar content, you'll also know where they are in their\ncustomer journey\n.\nAdditional metrics help to determine the overall quality of the leads generated from each webinar. These metrics include:\nEngagement\n.\nHow engaged was your lead\nin responding to polls during the webinar? Did they ask a question during Live Q&A? Are they still opening and clicking on your promotional emails now that the webinar is over? And, most importantly, did they click on your call-to-action at the end of the event?\nContent assets downloaded.\nDownloading assets would typically be considered a \"soft\" KPI. But this is still integral information for your sales team to have—and for you to assess the success of any content supporting your webinar topic. You may even wish to assign more lead score points for downloading a \"high intent\" piece of content, like a comparison or pricing sheet.\nDemo requests.\nHow many leads requested a product demo after attending your webinar?\nMeetings booked.\nHow many leads requested a sales call or meeting after attending your webinar?\nOverall lead score.\nWhile every company generates\nlead scores\ndifferently, all the actions a lead takes before, during, and after a webinar can help you determine where they fall in the buyer's journey and how likely they are to become a customer. How many high-scoring leads does each of your webinars generate?\nThe more qualified leads you hand over to the sales team, the more valuable your event content is.\nSales and Revenue Attribution\nYou can see exactly how your event impacted the deal cycle with proper tracking.\nThrough the Welcome/Salesforce integration, you can see how your attendees are moving through the funnel post-event. To do this, track the following\nNet new pipeline from every virtual event\nThe number of closed-won opportunities from each webinar\nAnd the total amount of closed-won revenue generated by your webinars\nWith data like this, you'll never scramble to prove webinar ROI again!\nExperience\nWelcome\nA webinar platform designed for marketers to host jaw-dropping experiences that drive revenue.\nRequest a demo"}

Everybody and their mother flocked to the video conferencing tool to fill the void of lost interpersonal connections.\nAs businesses navigated new social distancing rules, Zoom also became the go-to video platform for creating a virtual work environment and emulating in-person events. We love Zoom for what it is: an awesome tool for 1:1 video conferencing.\nBut the heart of any great virtual event or meeting platform is the ability to foster human connection. Connecting with other people is a genuine human need. Unfortunately, running large events and big meetings on Zoom makes building authentic connections more difficult. Audiences need interactive, immersive environments and experiences to feel engaged and transform from passive audience members into active participants.\nThat’s not to say there isn't a time and place for casual meetings with your team. But when it comes to a major event or presentation, production value and performance makes all the difference.\nIn this article, we’ll dive deeper into the comparisons between Zoom Webinar and Welcome, so you can get a better idea of which video platform is best suited for your virtual events or company meetings.\nKeeping your Audience Members Engaged\nZoom Webinar is different from its Zoom Meeting counterpart. Zoom Meeting is ideal for hosting smaller groups with lots of face-to-face interaction. Zoom Webinar is better suited for large audiences with one or a few people presenting to a listening audience.\nWelcome fuses these two concepts together. Similar to a virtual auditorium or event stage, our platform features a main stage area that hosts large audiences and allows attendees to interact with the content, speakers, and each other.\nCompared to Zoom's rudimentary engagement features like standard Q&A, chat, and polling, we've designed ours to be as immersive as possible. For instance, Welcome’s polls are embedded in the run-of-show. Instead of voting in a disruptive pop-up window, your audience votes on the main stage of your event in real-time.\nPolling on Welcome\nAlong with public and private chat with emojis and gifs, Welcome also takes a different approach to Q&A. We offer a more personal experience that closely emulates an in-person question and answer exchange. Attendees are brought on-stage live to ask speakers their questions. Audience questions can also be upvoted, so speakers address the most burning questions first.\nWhen you want your audience to engage on a more personal level, use one-to-one video calling or set up separate breakout rooms and lounges for smaller group discussions. These features intentionally foster deeper conversations. Add another layer of fun to your event by encouraging attendees to snap a group photo in a branded photo booth. Now they’ll have a nice souvenir from the event to share on social media!\nVirtual Event Analytics and Beyond\nBoth Zoom and Welcome offer post-event analytics, so you can get a sense of who joined your event or meeting. But only Welcome's dashboard offers advanced analytics with key engagement metrics at a glance.\nAnalytics\nYou’ll also receive a 1-page Event Report Card with detailed insights into your event and session performance. These insights include:\nAverage time spent at the event\nThe average number of engagements per attendee\nConversions in event funnel\nBreakdown of how attendees engaged\nEngagement of attendees over time\nDetermine whether your attendees stay throughout the event and pinpoint when they start to drop off. This will give you an idea of when and where you should introduce new ways to engage your audience the next time around.\nHigh-quality Video Production Infused with Your Brand\nWhen you attend events in person, you expect a certain level of production value. Virtual events are no different.\nWelcome offers a white-label experience for your event that drives home your brand identity. An epic hype video amps up your crowd, while visual overlays for presenter content allows your audience to interact with the presentation in real-time. These capabilities kick your production value up a notch, from ok to stellar.\nBecause it’s designed for simple presentations, Zoom Webinar is not optimized to deliver high-production value. It does compress audio and video to make it easier to stream. But if you’re planning to share high-quality music or mix a high-quality, pre-recorded video into your feed, Zoom has its limitations.\nWelcome is essentially a built-in video production tool – it's like having a production studio at your fingertips. It allows you to do all of the things we mentioned above and more, giving your attendees an interactive experience rather than just another presentation (but, hey, we can do more traditional webinars, too!)\nAnd it doesn’t take an entire team to pull off a high-quality event. One person can run the entire event from Welcome’s Control Room. Prep your speakers backstage in the Green Room, invite attendees on stage, and create branded overlays, titles, and lower thirds directly in the platform using Stage Kit. You can design your event like a pro, without having to be one.\nWhen it comes to branding, virtual event design looks different from the on-site designs we’re used to. But, visual components are still important for virtual branding. Customize your event using your brand colors, custom imagery, backdrops, and logos.\nBranding your event transforms it from a bland virtual experience into a custom virtual experience defined by your company’s ethos. While Zoom Webinar offers the ability to add branded banners and logos to your registration form, the event itself lacks most of these branding capabilities.\nWhether you want to host a large marketing event, a sleekly designed webinar, or an engaging and immersive company meeting, the ingredients for hosting a successful event are all the same.\nUnless your attendees crave a casual, unstructured meeting or a passive presentation, choose a virtual event platform that:\nOffers engagement capabilities that drive human connection\nAllows you to create a high-quality, interactive experience\nGives you the ability to brand your event with your own identity\nProvides detailed analytics about audience engagement\nTo see how Welcome and Zoom Webinar stack up feature by feature, check out the matrix below.\nWelcome vs Zoom Webinar\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/welcome-vs-zoom-for-virtual-events\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

Now that many of our day-to-day management tasks can be systematized and automated, what role should you play as a team leader?\nThe answer? Develop the EQ skills that support remote team collaboration. Slack might be where you check in on your team’s progress, but it can’t help you facilitate a difficult conversation—or coach individual team members to success. (At least, not yet!)\nWhat Is Emotional Intelligence?\nEmotional intelligence, or emotional quotient (EQ), skills are all about how you perceive and regulate emotions.\nThis applies to your own emotions, like recognizing when you’re stressed about a deadline or frustrated by a colleague at work. It also applies to the ability to recognize\nother\npeople’s emotions, like whether your team members are exhibiting symptoms of burnout.\nEQ skills are closely related to communication skills, as well as our ability to express empathy, problem-solve, and offer emotional support.\nWhy Do Emotional Intelligence Skills Matter in the Remote Workplace?\nEmotional intelligence skills matter during remote work for a few important reasons:\nIt’s harder to understand the tone of voice behind digital communication, especially if you’ve never met or interacted with a colleague in person.\nThere can be breakdowns in asynchronous communication around process, roles, or deadlines that might lead to confusion and frustration. Managers will have to be ready to deal with these emotions in a productive way.\nBuilding the relationships that are key to a positive company culture takes more time and intention during remote work.\nThe shift to remote work has introduced complexity into everyone’s lives. It’s important to be empathetic to individual situations, whether someone is parenting and working from home, dealing with illness, or managing another high-stress situation.\nWe’ve all faced these challenges while working on remote teams. Mastering EQ skills will help you build positive work relationships across physical distances, facilitate difficult conversations, and support team members who are dealing with challenging personal situations.\nHere are the five EQ skills you can focus on to manage your remote team even more effectively:\n1. Incredible Communication\nWhen it comes to managing a distributed team, incredible communication skills are more important than ever. In fact, as many as 23% of employees surveyed by\nAsana\nduring the pandemic identified communication breakdowns, like unclear processes and uncertainty over prioritie, as one of the top reasons for missing deadlines.\nUsing tools like\nSlack\nto check in on progress or\nWelcome\nto present your efforts to the company are still clearly a must. But managers in today’s remote workforce also have the responsibility of skillfully building the connections that are key to a\npositive employee experience\n.\nAs a manager, you can demonstrate this new, empathetic form of communication in numerous ways during your syncs:\nReflective listening\n: Demonstrate you understand what your team members are saying, or how they’re feeling, by reflecting their concerns and observations back to them. This helps build trust and alignment, especially when you’re not in the same room together.\nMastering the art of small talk\n: Small talk\nis\nimportant! Don’t just launch into your meeting. Make sure you’re connecting with your team members and facilitating their connection to one another.\nDelivering feedback that helps your team grow\n: Highly observational, non-judgmental feedback on performance gives your team members more opportunities to be curious about their interactions in meetings and presentations. Lead from a place of curiosity to encourage a growth mindset. It’s a communication skill\nand\na relationship-building skill all rolled into one.\nIt’s important to take advantage of the moments you’re “face-to-face” with your team to practice the communication skills that support your company’s values and employee experience goals.\nBeing a great communicator on Slack or over email never gets old, but that type of asynchronous support is better for managing and clarifying roles, deadlines, and progress than building work relationships that matter. Great managers know how to communicate with their remote teams both ways!\n‍\n2. Empathy & Emotional Connection\nAccording to\nHarvard Business Review\n, employees who feel supported at work are less likely to report mental health concerns—and more likely to stay in their jobs. Researchers found that being emotionally supportive is a key managerial skill that impacts employee experience, from retention to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.\nAnd it goes beyond being a great, empathetic communicator. You’ll also need to offer tactical support, like access to services or time off, so your team can get the rest or care they need to thrive.\nOne of the best ways to\nstay on top of emotional wellbeing\nis to make check-ins on mental health and stress levels a regular part of work. Even a simple ranking of stress levels can tell you a lot about how your team is feeling.\nHave an employee who’s struggling? Don’t brush it off. You can:\nLend an ear—or a shoulder.\nPrioritize listening to understand and empathize before you launch into solutions. Sometimes people just need to be heard. Asking what employees need can open the door to more specific types of support\nOffer specific types of resources.\nAsking what employees need can open the door to more specific types of support. But be prepared to offer services or resources they may not realize they have access to, from mental health services to time off.\nRedistribute or reprioritize work.\nWe’re currently experiencing\nrecord levels of burnout\nacross every sector, and managers have a huge impact on workload. Have you adequately distributed work across your team? Are your timelines sound? Do you need to hire more people? Adjust your expectations? Shift a deadline (or five) around? Identify the strategies that can offer a struggling employee immediate short-term relief as you continue making medium- and long-term plans.\nAuthorize vacation or self-care time.\nSometimes the best strategy for a struggling employee is to simply take more time to rest and recharge. Authorize vacation time or self-care time and assure them that the work can wait.\n3. Employee Coaching\nThe role of the middle manager continues to change, and, in many cases, disappear. According to\nMcKinsey\n, this organizational trend has been exacerbated by the pandemic and the shift to remote work.\nAs remote managers know well, many of your systems for tracking workflow are now automated. Project management software like\nAsana\n,\nTrello\n, and\nJira\nmake it easy to see roles, responsibilities, and progress against deadlines.\nAnd while your job as a manager is still to oversee these processes for your team, ideally you have more time to support your employees in their own career growth. This means that\ncoaching skills\nare becoming just as crucial as management skills.\nCoaching takes many forms, including:\nOffering tactical feedback in one-on-ones\nDiscussing career goals and pathways in—and outside of—your company\nRecognizing and upskilling talent on your team\nConnecting team members with specific resources, like career coaches\nYour efforts to learn coaching skills will go well beyond supporting the needs of individual team members. They also have a direct impact on retention, employee satisfaction at work, and company culture.\n4. Boundary-Setting\nYou may have more flexibility as a remote team manager, but you’re also being inundated with emails, notifications, and meeting requests. And so is your team!\nIn order to address remote work overwhelm and burnout, it’s up to managers to\nhelp their teams manage boundaries\nbetween work and home life. That makes good boundaries an incredible EQ skill to develop for yourself—and to respect in other team members.\n‍\nSupport healthy work boundaries by:\nAdvocating for shared focus time\n. We’re all in too many meetings. Whether you create core collaboration hours to facilitate teamwork or no-meeting days for head-down, deep focus time, adopt management strategies that mitigate overwhelm.\nModel healthy boundaries.\nThe realities of flexible work mean you might actually be catching up on work during nights or weekends to hit your 40 hours. But that doesn’t mean your team has to know—or feel obligated to respond! Schedule emails to arrive at the beginning of your work day to respect your team’s out-of-office time.\nPut notifications on mute.\nNothing disrupts an important meeting like the double-clack of the Slack messenger. Encourage your team to mute notifications during focus time and meetings, as well as nights and weekends. During the work day, it’ll help to eliminate context switching. The rest of the time, it’s all about respecting work-life boundaries!\n5. Building Connections\nFacilitating meaningful connections between your team members is a crucial EQ skill and a talent in and of itself. After all, good managers care as much about healthy working relationships as they do about the quality of work done by their direct reports.\nOne of the best ways to build connections on a remote team is to focus on the experiences that build trust, increase understanding, and break down remote work silos.\nConsider incorporating the following types of events into your workflow:\nTeam-building experiences.\nWhether you volunteer together or take a virtual field trip,\nteam-building experiences\nhelp virtual teams learn how to problem-solve and work together more effectively—even from a distance.\nCross-team collaborations.\nActively seek opportunities to work with other teams in your organization. Maybe it’s time to get product and engineering in the same virtual space. Or marketing and sales. How does your work change when it becomes more collaborative?\nNetworking.\nIntroducing team members to other employees in the organization is another way to break down silos. Suggest integrating\nnetworking sessions\ninto your\nall-hands meeting\n, or make networking a critical\nonboarding\ngoal for new hires.\nIt might seem overly social on the surface, but for remote workers, social interaction is a major plus. Social\nconnections are still crucial\nto how we get work done, build company culture, and create an employee experience that makes your team want to stick around.\nFinal Thoughts\nYou’re an expert in directing your team’s Slack channel, managing deadlines, and communicating priorities. Mastering these top EQ skills will only make you that much stronger as a remote team manager.\nAnd you can use\nWelcome\nto help you do it! Welcome is employee event software that supports your entire employee lifecycle.

And while that may be true, there's still the question of managing a remote team, so everyone is on the same page and working towards common goals.\nOne way to do this is by setting clear expectations for remote employees. Any industry with a remote-first work culture will struggle without establishing rules on how and what kind of work gets done.\nIn this post, we'll explain why setting expectations should be at the top of your employee onboarding checklist and how to set employee expectations for remote work.\nWhy setting expectations for remote work matters\nIn traditional workplaces, managing meetings and company events was never challenging to arrange. Employees were in the same location, and although it might not have been the most convenient task in the day, getting everyone together could be as easy as posting a bulletin on the break room board.\nThe world has changed to a work-from-home culture, and businesses need to adjust. A distributed workforce is no longer stuck in their office for up to eight hours a day. They run errands, cook meals, take care of children, and manage their homes while working.\nCompanies that can communicate their expectations effectively will be able to gather their teams when necessary. They will know when to count on their employees and how to hold them accountable for mistakes effectively.\nPerhaps the most critical aspect of setting clear expectations is\ncreating a satisfying work culture\nthat keeps employees around. In March of 2022 alone,\n4.53 million workers\nquit their jobs in what is being called \"The Great Resignation.\"\nRetaining employees is getting harder for businesses, but giving new hires clear expectations will help them know exactly what your company's remote work culture is like. The information will give them a chance to be successful in their position and provide a clear framework of what it takes to be a part of the team.\nUnderstanding what expectations for remote employees can do for your business is helpful, but it won't get the job done for you. You'll need strategies to implement expectations at every level of the employee lifecycle, from\nemployee onboarding\nto retirement.\nHow to set expectations with remote employees\nCreating a company culture\nwith remote employees can be difficult, but it's not impossible. Your team can become stronger with the right tools and processes without needing in-person interaction.\nHere are a few ways to set clear expectations with your remote employees to prevent isolation, loss of information, or missed briefings.\nSet clear expectations from Day 1\nThe first available moment you have to set clear expectations with remote employees is the application process. This is where you can start to lay out what the company culture is like, how you communicate, and what is expected of new hires.\nIn the job description, be clear about your expectations for working remotely. For example, if you require remote employees to be available during specific hours or days, list that in the job posting. It would help to list any required qualifications, such as specific software experience or customer service skills. The equipment necessary to perform the job should also be included as well as standards on employee performance.\nThe interview process is also an opportunity to set expectations with potential remote employees. During the initial phone screen, take some time to explain your company's policies on remote work, including how you communicate and collaborate. This is also a good time to ask questions about the candidate's experience with remote work and if they have any questions about the expectations.\nExplain to your potential employee how you plan to measure their performance over time. What key metrics will be considered? How long will you evaluate their performance? Giving your employees a crystal-clear vision of how they can improve will set them up for success.\nAfter a candidate is hired, the onboarding process is key to setting clear expectations for remote work. During this time, you can go over your company's policies and procedures and introduce the new hire to the team they'll be working with. It's important to provide as much information as possible so that the transition into the remote work environment is as smooth as possible.\nShare your workplace communication strategy\nRemote employees are the most vulnerable to communication breakdowns. It's important to have a clear strategy for how you will communicate with your team and make sure everyone is on the same page.\nThere are various ways to communicate with remote employees, including Slack for async communication, Zoom for one-to-one meetings, and Welcome for synchronous virtual gatherings. It would help if you decided which method or combination of methods works best for your team and stick to it.\nIt's also important to establish a clear hierarchy for communication. Who should employees go to with questions? Who is the final decision-maker on projects? When multiple people are involved in a project, it can be helpful to create a communication plan outlining who is responsible for what tasks.\nHelp your remote employees by providing a guideline for how you expect your team to talk with each other. Not just with tools but with the overall strategy, including what's appropriate to discuss virtually and what isn't. Is your workplace very professional, and little outside talk should be allowed, or is there room for jokes and playfulness?\nGiving your workers outlines that cover the methods of communication and the types of communication allowed will lead to a more cohesive and productive team.\nCheck-in with remote employees every day\nIt won't help your employees to cover all expectations on the first day of onboarding and never speak of it again. Repetition is how humans learn, so ensure you frequently check in with your remote team.\nA daily check-in can be as simple as a quick Slack message or video call to ask how their day is going and if they need help with anything. These brief interactions will help you stay up-to-date on what's going on with your team and will help you understand if expectations are being met.\nIt also gives your team a chance to communicate with you if they aren't hitting their goals. You can correct the issues before they turn into larger patterns.\nThis process will make it easier when it's time to hold people accountable. You'll have a good idea of what's happening and why they may not be meeting expectations. Checking in every day gives your employees and yourself a chance to set good habits and meet your expectations from the beginning.\nMeasure Progress Effectively\nEmployees won't understand if they are meeting your expectations if you don't have a clear and efficient way of measuring progress. This is where key metrics come in.\nProgress should be measured regularly, whether daily, weekly, or monthly. Employees need to understand how they are being evaluated and what they need to do to improve. If you're not sure where to start, here are a few ideas for remote work performance metrics:\nNumber of tasks completed\nQuality of work\nCommunication with team members\nResponsiveness to customer inquiries\nMeeting deadlines\nGetting clear with your remote employees on how their work is measured gives them an opportunity to change. It provides a tangible way for remote workers to know if they are hitting the mark or not.\nThis can also make it easier to hold remote workers accountable or know when it's time to let them go. Before you get to that point, make sure you're communicating to employees how many opportunities they have to improve.\nIf you never communicate what leads to termination, it can create resentment towards your company. Remote workers who are let go can complete negative reviews on your company or share their experiences in remote worker forums.\nConstantly Review Your Expectations\nHaving the same work expectations your company created 15 years ago won't be relevant to today's standards. You'll find many of your remote workers aren't hitting the expectations not because they are slacking but because the expectations are no longer reasonable.\nThe future of work is constantly changing, and so should your employee expectations. Take the time to review your current policies and see if they make sense for the work being completed today.\nYou may find that some of your remote employees are working more hours than you realized or that their job has changed so much that they need different expectations.\nIt may be challenging to keep up with the constant change, but it's essential to have relevant and attainable employee expectations. Reviewing your policies regularly will help you ensure that your team can meet its goals.\nFinal Thoughts\nGiving remote employees clear expectations will improve your entire work culture. Employees will understand how to improve and become successful, and you'll have a happier and more productive workforce.\nWelcome makes it easy to communicate your expectations with remote workers wherever they happen to be. The employee event software includes\nremote employee onboarding events\nand\nteam-building activities\nin engaging and informative environments. Gather employee feedback, clarify understanding, and track EQ scores on an easy-to-use dashboard.\n‍\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/how-to-set-employee-expectations-for-remote-work\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

But since everything changed, marketers have switched their attention to getting their money’s worth out of virtual events—taking full advantage of the advanced analytics and reporting capabilities many platforms now boast.\nUnfortunately, this hasn’t always translated into a great experience for participants. Many virtual events are bland, uninspiring, and do little to combat a growing sense of screen fatigue. The problem? Virtual events simply aren’t meeting attendees’ needs. Or worse, they put marketers’ needs for attribution and lead-scoring ahead of creating a great experience.\nI don’t blame marketers. For many, virtual events are still relatively new (or newly prioritized). I think it comes down to a lack of understanding of what makes a compelling virtual experience—which is different, though related, to a great in-person event.\nSo what do your guests need in order to have a meaningful and memorable virtual event experience? It all comes down to Maslow’s hierarchy of virtual event attendee needs.\nMaslow’s hierarchy of virtual event attendee needs\nA quick refresher:\nMaslow’s Hierarchy of Needs\nis a motivational theory, depicting human needs as a hierarchical framework (often illustrated as a pyramid). The theory goes that you have to satisfy baseline needs before attending to higher-order requirements. For example, a person needs food before they can worry about friendship.\nIt’s also a useful model for virtual events. Your guests have foundational needs that must be met before more sophisticated albeit marketable ones, like “connection.” It’s only by starting from the ground up that you ever fulfill their higher-order needs.\nWhat are these needs, you may ask? There are six to consider. They fall into three categories—basic, psychological, and self-fulfillment.\nMaslow’s hierarchy of virtual event attendee needs\nWhat does this framework mean for you? Well, the reason people might not be loving your virtual events (sorry, I said it) is that you aren’t meeting their needs in the right order.\n1. Structure\nIf you find attendees drop out of your event or don’t stay until the end, it may be because you lack structure. Events that lack structure give people anxiety and make them less likely to interact or engage. If there’s no clear agenda and your attendees feel uncertain about where your event is going, what’s to stop them from clicking away? The reverse is also true: Having structure puts your attendees at ease, allowing them to relax and enjoy.\nTo provide structure and allow your attendees to immerse themselves in your event, you need to tell them what to expect, remind them of the plan, and actually follow through. Give attendees a very clear sense of what will happen and when it will all end. And don't just drop it in the invite email—make it constantly available, so people feel oriented at all times.\nI recommend following this run-of-show (which you can modify based on your needs) to help you stay organized and provide your audience with a sense of structure.\nExample run of show\nAt the beginning of your event, be sure to walk your participants through the run-of-show so they know what to expect. Better yet, send the agenda ahead of time or pin it in the chat so your audience can follow along.\nChecklist: Build structure into your event\nShare your agenda with attendees\nAt each stage, remind them what's next\nStart and stop in a timely manner\n2. Guidance\nIf your events have a tendency to descend into anarchy, a lack of guidance may be to blame. Many hosts are hesitant to enforce their authority on an event, but it’s important to understand that limitations are actually a gift for your attendees. In the absence of rules, people start unmuting themselves and talking over one another. In contrast, when your participants know the rules of engagement, it provides a basis for harmony in behavior and reduces the social anxiety of not knowing how to act.\nTell your guests exactly what to do to get the most out of your event. Share your house rules at the outset of the event (and make sure to enforce them). And don’t forget to orient your guests in the virtual environment—for example, where can they find the chat, submit a question for Q&A, and navigate to a breakout room for networking after the talk?\nContinually prepare your guests for what’s coming up next and provide them with direction to get the most out of the event. For instance, if you'll be taking questions, announce the Q&A periodically to get people warmed up and thinking about what they want to ask. Or if there's a break for networking, tell people to come away with three new people’s emails. Make it fun and lighthearted.\nChecklist: Guide your guests effectively\nShare house rules and enforce them\nOrient your guests in the virtual environment\nProvide guidance on how to get the most out of the event\n3. Unique Value\nIf you get a lot of registrations, but those registrations don’t turn into actual attendees, you may not have articulated your unique value clearly enough. Your unique value is your guest’s reason for attending your event. Without it, your audience may face the day-of dilemma: If they don’t see a compelling reason to attend your event live, they may fall prey to their burgeoning to-do list and skip.\nYou need to show your audience that you’re giving them the opportunity to learn or experience something very specific they can’t get anywhere else. This is your “only-ness” factor—the thing that\nonly you\ncan provide. Maybe it’s the chance to ask a question of one of their heroes. Or maybe it’s the opportunity to learn a skill that will help them in their career. Or maybe it’s the opportunity to experience something unique. For instance,\nBrooks Wine\nruns virtual tasting sessions hosted by artisan producers—allowing foodies to try delicious food and wine under the guidance of an expert. Whatever your event’s focus, show your audience that it’s time well spent.\nChecklist: Make your event time well spent\nCenter your event around a uniquely valuable experience\nClearly articulate the reason your guests should attend\nRespect your participants’ time by making your event only as long as it needs to be\n4. Engagement\nDo people attend your events, but nobody really participates? Consider building in more opportunities for engagement. With screen fatigue at an all-time high, it’s critical to consider not just\nwhat\nyou’re presenting, but also\nhow\nyou’re delivering your content. Use a visually appealing format to help your audience digest your content—think visuals, overlays, and video footage. Incorporate interactive activities, like practice exercises, games, or even a group stretch. If it’s going to be a long session, give your attendees a break part way through.\nYour attendees will thank you for it. Private equity firm Hg achieved their all-time\nhighest NPS score\nat a recent virtual HR & Talent Summit by incorporating a hands-on activity. They mailed terrarium-building kits to attendees all over the world for a live workshop, which fed back into the conference’s theme of wellbeing and self-care. But if you decide to include an interactive component, make sure it’s serving your purpose. “You can't just do an interactive event to be interactive,” says Jessica Greenhalgh, Head of Community & Portfolio Engagement at Hg. “You have to relate it back to the content and format of the day.”\nChecklist: Create an engaging experience\nUse visuals, videos, and overlays to illustrate your messaging\nIncorporate interactivity into your content\nTie activities back to your key lessons or takeaways\n5. Connection\nIf your networking events feel forced, you may need to work on your facilitation. Humans have a core need for connection—in the original Maslow’s hierarchy, two out of the five needs deal directly with human relationships (esteem and belonging). Yet it can be challenging to replicate in-person connections over digital space.\nMy number one tip: Don’t leave moments of connection up to chance. You need to be intentional about how you’re going to facilitate them—much more so than in a physical event where people are free to mingle. For instance, you might start your event with networking (before your feature presentation), so your attendees have a chance to get to know each other. You may also want to open multiple virtual breakout rooms with different topics so people can gravitate to the conversations that most interest them. Ideally, have at least one “host” from your team in each breakout room who can get the conversation going and make everyone feel comfortable.\nTo prevent screen fatigue and help your attendees save their energy for these key moments of connection, have them only turn their cameras on when it comes time for them to interact.\nResearch\nshows the stress of being on camera can drastically deplete people’s energy and contribute to screen fatigue. If your participants are simply watching a presentation, allow them to sit back and enjoy the show. When the time comes for them to participate, you can then encourage them to turn their cameras on.\nChecklist: Cultivate moments of meaningful connection\nStart your event with networking\nStation a host in each breakout room to warm up the conversation\nMinimize on-camera time to reduce screen fatigue and keep your participants fresh\n6. Purpose\nIf you’ve made it to these heights, there likely aren’t any glaring issues with your virtual events. They’re probably engaging, informative, and fun—the kinds of events people love to return to. Still, imbuing your events with purpose can take them from memorable to\nmeaningful\n. If you’re thinking at this level, you’ve unlocked all that's good in branding and event marketing. You’re helping people self-actualize.\nTo create an experience that’s truly meaningful, your event should let your participants connect to a higher purpose. But what does this look like? First, it’s important to understand the difference between the outward purpose of your event and its higher purpose. For instance, imagine a virtual conference. The surface-level purpose of the event is education and networking—attendees come to learn and network with their peers.\nIts higher purpose, on the other hand, takes a\nstance.\nIt’s disputable, as Priya Parker puts it in\nThe Art of Gathering\n. Some examples of a higher purpose for our hypothetical virtual conference could be:\nTo promote creative thinking in our industry\nTo foster relationships between people facing similar challenges\nTo break down the barriers between traditionally siloed fields\nThe more defined your purpose, the easier it will be to make the right decisions for your event. This also ties into the idea of making meaningful connections—your attendees will find connection with the people they share a purpose with. Having a higher purpose elevates your event from being simply mechanical to being transcendent. Your attendees will experience your event on a different level if they feel they are a part of something bigger than themselves.\nConnect your event to a higher purpose:\nChoose a distinct, disputable purpose for your event\nConsider: How will you facilitate connection between people who share the same purpose? (See “Connection” for ideas)\nDecide what’s the single most important thing for attendees to take away from your event—and make sure you repeat and reinforce it often\nFinal thoughts\nSwitching to a primarily virtual event landscape has been a big change for marketers, but also for participants. While marketers have sometimes struggled to meet attendees’ needs in the virtual space, virtual events have the same opportunity as in-person to fulfill some of our deepest human needs—it’s just a question of adjusting tactics to fit this new way of gathering. When you consider your attendees’ needs first, you’re well on your way to hosting an event that’s not just memorable, but meaningful. And if you tend to your participants’ needs, results will follow.\nAbout Welcome\nFrom our interactive polling feature to our state-of-the-art production studio, each of Welcome’s features add up to provide a truly exceptional virtual experience platform.

When everyone logs on or off at different times, how can you make sure your entire company is on the same page?\nTake action by using new tools, refining your internal communications policies, and planning like crazy. After all, the more consistent you can be, the easier it is to rally your entire team and make progress.\n“In the midst of change, it's really important to have consistent channels where people know what to expect,” said Laney Erokan, Director of Internal Communications & Employer Branding at\nPatreon\n.\nWith clear and consistent communication policies, you’ll boost employee engagement and foster trust among remote colleagues.\nAfter all, many of our team members are no longer just “down the hall” — they’re on a Slack channel or in our inboxes. And this reality fundamentally changes the way we communicate at work.\n5 Best Practices for Effective Team Communication\nIn our recent event,\nHybrid Team Communication: New Tools, Rules, and Norms\n, Erokan joined Laura Clyburn, Head of Internal Communications at\nServiceTitan\n, and\nWelcome\n’s Co-Founder and CEO,\nRoberto Ortiz\n, to discuss how to incorporate more empathy into your leadership style.\nHere are 5 event take-aways that offer best practices for communicating with your hybrid team effectively:\nClarity and consistency boosts internal communication and\nmakes hybrid work more equitable\n.\nThe shift to hybrid work takes sustained change management efforts. Be prepared to get buy-in across the board!\nShare and develop clear policies for your\ninternal communications tools\n, from Slack to GSuite.\nBe intentional about making employee events hybrid. No one should feel bad about opting to attend virtually.\nLean on\nemployee resource groups\n(ERGs) as ways to communicate effectively with your teams. ERGs are also a great way to develop leaders within the company!\nWatch the full event\nhere\nfor more ideas and internal communication best practices.\nClarity is Key with Hybrid Team Communication\nAbove all, it’s important to let your people know what to expect by keeping internal communications to designated channels on a consistent schedule. At Patreon, for example, they hold an\nall-hands meeting\nevery Thursday, whether or not the CEO can attend.\nClarity and consistency is especially important as you continue to grow and onboard new employees.\n“We're growing really fast,” said Clyburn of ServiceTitan. “We're hiring new folks, and so making it really easy for them to understand what the meeting cadence is, what the schedule is, and where they can plug in right off the bat in those initial weeks” helps new hires ramp up quickly.\nAt Patreon, part of the\nonboarding experience\nalso includes reviewing virtual and hybrid meeting expectations.\n“We teach meeting etiquette in a virtual state or hybrid state, and the woman who runs it has a slide that says ‘No agenda, no attendance,’” said Erokan.\nSetting these expectations early ensures that your entire team is working from the same communications handbook.\nHybrid Work Policies and Change Management\nThe shift to hybrid work policies affects everyone in your company, so you can expect that it will take a real change management effort to get buy-in.\nAccording to Clyburn, this means being very clear about your hybrid work policies and being able to address employee feedback or pushback as you go.\n“If there is an exception [to returning to office], here's what the exception process is, or here's your avenue for next steps,” said Clyburn. “There's very unique scenarios [with a distributed team] where people need to have clear information and a path to discuss them.”\nFor Erokan, the shift to hybrid also means not over-determining how people spend their flex time, including company-wide ‘no meeting days.’\n“Some of our team recruiters, our creator-facing teams, are on meetings all day with creators and candidates,” said Erokan of Patreon’s work cadence.\n“A ‘no meeting day’ doesn't work for them. So we encourage people to find time where they can in their own schedule. We can't over-complicate or over-orchestrate this.”\nTools for Effective Team Communication\nThanks to improvements in\ntechnology for distributed teams\n, it’s easier than ever to connect your company and improve workflow. Here are the tools that rose to the top of our conversation:\nSlack\nWe all know\nSlack\nis an incredible team communication tool, but there’s more you can do to make it work for your distributed team. By improving the names of your channels, you’ll make it easier for team members to search and access important information and conversations. You may also wish to limit posting permissions on some internal channels. This will keep the channel clear, while allowing for questions and emoji reactions.\nGSuite\nGoogle products make online collaboration easy. Just make sure you’ve clearly outlined processes for collaboration and document sharing, so your entire company is using\nGSuite\nthe same way.\nGlean\nLooking for omni-search software that links all of your collaboration tools together?\nGlean\nmight be the tool for you. It’s the platform Erokan is most looking forward to implementing in the near future.\nWelcome\nAs an employee event platform,\nWelcome\nis the perfect way to facilitate hybrid all-hands meetings or experiential events that improve relationships.\nAs Clyburn suggests, it’s important to be intentional as you plan events for a hybrid audience, “making sure that the option is there to join virtually, and that it's not a big deal.”\nCrisis Management, Leading with Empathy, and Employee Resource Groups\nEmployee resource groups\n, or ERGs, are an internal communications director’s secret weapon. ERGs help boost internal comms and provide pathways to leadership for employees—a real win-win for the entire company.\nIn times of crisis or external conflict, ERGs can also be an important channel for localizing outreach and\nleading with empathy\n, says Erokan. “ERG leaders or leaders for a reason,” she said. They are leaders in your company; bring them into your communications process.”\nErokan also recommends developing a crisis playbook to determine how you will respond to external events as a company, whether through internal communication or externally made statements and positioning.\nUltimately, “let bad news be bad news,” said Erokan. “Don’t try to spin it.” Even if external events add pressure to your work-days, know that you can count on your ERG leaders for extra support.\nFinal Thoughts\nImprove internal communications and keep your entire team engaged with Welcome’s\nemployee event platform\n. Live chat connects team members who are far apart, and even your event producers can easily join in the conversation and build new relationships.\nAs part of your\nremote work tech stack\n, Welcome injects energy and engagement into many types of work events, from onboarding to sales kickoffs to experiential events. In a quickly changing world, we make it easier than ever to gather your team together and ensure that everyone stays on the same page.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/effective-hybrid-team-communication\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

That's why we're excited to announce the launch of live captioning within the Welcome platform. The newest capability improves viewer comprehension, offers viewer flexibility in different environments, but most importantly, makes your content accessible for all.\nWith closed captioning, Welcome just got a bit more\nwelcoming\n.\nThe pandemic has impacted and changed the way companies use video. Virtual and hybrid events have taken center stage, remote work is our new reality, and video is making it all happen.\nWith video at the forefront, closed captioning is no longer a nice-to-have feature; it's an absolute must for many organizations. Event captioning is often needed to meet internal accessibility and inclusiveness requirements set by the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act\n(ADA).\nThe ADA was created to help keep the same rights and opportunities open for persons with disabilities. It prohibits discrimination against any person with disabilities in all areas of public life – this includes your organization's video content. So whether you're hosting a large virtual conference or a company all-hands meeting, closed captioning ensures that your video content is accessible to every viewer.\nOther benefits\nAlthough accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing is the most crucial use case of closed captioning, captions can benefit everyone watching. They can enhance viewer comprehension, attention to, and memory of the event content. Also with the increasing popularity of mobile devices, viewers could be somewhere where access to audio is limited. Captions allow people to tune into your event, even if they're in a noisy environment.\nPlaying in picture-in-picture\nLike\nAdd to Watch Later\nShare\nPlay\n00:00\n00:46\nSettings\nPicture-in-Picture\nFullscreen\nQuality\nClick to Unmute\nThis opens in a new window.\n‍\nClosed captioning made easier\nSo you may be wondering how closed captioning works within the Welcome platform. Gone are the days when you needed to hire a professional linguist. We like to make things easier for our customers, and that includes closed captioning too.\nOur live captioning automatically transcribes audio to text and is directly embedded into the platform for a seamless experience. Captions are highly accurate, include punctuation, recognize numbers, abbreviations, and Proper Nouns. You can rest assured that your audio is being transcribed correctly and is not jumbled-up jibberish.\nMost importantly, we believe in accessibility for all and want to ensure that everyone has equal access to our platform. That's why we've made it possible for all attendees to turn on captions. This feature is included in every pricing plan, so your events can be widely accessible—no matter which plan you choose. Just ask your Welcome Customer Success Manager to turn it on for you.\nWant to see live captioning in action?\nBook a demo\n.

How can we make sure we adapt well and how to take care of our mental health so we’re not sacrificing it at the expense of the work that we’re doing?\nIn our recent event,\nTransforming How We Work\n, Tech Leaders Arianna Huffington of the Huffington Post and Founder and CEO of\nThrive\nand Joe Thomas, Co-founder and CEO of\nLoom\ndiscussed the impact of employee burnout and how leaders can drive positive changes from the top down.\nBreaking Employee Burnout\nFor Arianna Huffington, she’s been familiar with burnout for years. “I was personally diagnosed with burnout in 2007 when I collapsed, but it’s existed for decades. The silver lining of the pandemic is that now it's front and center,” says Huffington. “It's not just front and center for the HR department, but for the C-suite too. We've finally recognized that employee wellbeing and mental health are fundamentally connected to business metrics attrition, retention, productivity, and health care costs. So the reason why I'm optimistic is because we’re finally acknowledging a problem.\nFor some people, working until two or three in the morning was a badge of honor and a characteristic of someone working hard. But more and more workers are realizing that it’s not actually worth the expense of all these other things in their lives.\nHuffington says there’s been a shift. “The shift is actually based on a scientific foundation, which is when we take time to recharge, to refuel, to renew ourselves, we are more effective at work.”\nJoe Thomas of Loom is on a mission to empower everyone to communicate effectively, regardless of where they're located. But when he’s not leading the charge at Loom, he’s a father to a brand new baby at home. “With paternity leave, I was very nervous about taking extended time off and ultimately, I came back feeling like I had recharged the tank in a way that I hadn't since the very beginning of Loom. I've been a significantly better CEO because of it.”\nIt’s a great example of leading from the top and giving your employees permission to follow. As Huffington says, “We’re still in the middle of a cultural transition. So a lot of people feel they need cultural permission to take care of themselves.”\nWatch the full event\nhere\nfor more insights about transforming how we work.\nUpskilling Humanity in the Workplace\nHuffington knows a thing or two about mental health in the workplace. Thrive is a\nbehavioral change platform\nand they’re making strides in humanizing the workplace. They’ve created 60-second interventions called\nThrive Resets\n. Based on neuroscience, it takes 60 seconds to course-correct from stress. Thrive Resets help break the cycle of cumulative stress with themes including breathing, stretching, gratitude, mindfulness, nature and can be customized to the individual. They can be played before, during and after your meeting.\n“We play Resets at the beginning of meetings to build social capital”, says Huffington. “It gives us a glimpse into a colleague’s life, one that we lose when we’re not physically together and asking each other more intimate questions about our lives.”\nSlack CEO Stuart Butterfield recently said that the road to understanding post-pandemic work is long, and  “we have 10 percent of the tools we need.”\nHuffington believes that we’re not just lacking 90% of the technology, but that we only have about 10% of the humanity needed. “Not everything will be solved by technology, we need to reconnect with a different part of ourselves, where we can find our creativity, empathy, peace, strength and resilience. If we don’t do that, the future will be very difficult. We’re living in uncertain times and resilience is more important than ever. It’s a human quality and human upskilling needs to be part of the future.”\nThomas believes that in order to bring more humanity into the workplace we need to be much more intentional. “Creating\nunique shared experiences\ncan accelerate building relationships when you’re primarily distributed. Even if you only get together once every 6 months as a team and once a year as a company, the value of that is so strong.”\nIn a digital world,\nasynchronous video\nis another powerful way to bring people together. “It starts at the very beginning of the employee lifecycle”, says Thomas. “Instead of sending an email intro of a new employee on Day 1, the new hire can record a video of themselves. By watching a video of the new hire walking through their interests and what they genuinely care about with human passion is super powerful.”\nAlso ask your employees what matters most to them and how you can support them as their manager. As Thomas said, “Humanity doesn’t change overnight, but we can start by enabling individuals to work in the way that is best for them. Work is not where you are, it’s what you do.”\nFinal Thoughts\nCompanies are still trying to figure out how to do remote work best. As their strategizing what their future workplace will look like, humanizing the employee experience must be a part of it.\nWelcome\nis employee event software that supports the entire employee lifecycle, including employee events.

{"id":"c68543ea-91a7-4979-be99-2df01955b80f","url":"https://www.experiencewelcome.com/blog/lionel-mohri-intuit-interview","title":"How Intuit uses design thinking to create empathetic experiences | Welcome Blog","text":"Sign up for The Drip\nJoin 5000+ marketers that receive The Drip newsletter covering the most relevant topics in B2B marketing.\nFirst name\nJob Title\nEmail\n*\nI agree to receive product updates and marketing emails from Welcome (recommended)\nFeatures\nPricing\nResources\nBlog\nMarketing Guides\nSupport\nEvents\nAbout\nLogin\nLogin\nDemo\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/lionel-mohri-intuit-interview\nLionel Mohri’\ns path to events was a meandering one. He grew up on three continents and initially trained as a mechanical engineer. He was even offered a job at Apple, but decided  to pursue a role at IDEO, a design consulting firm. There, he learned to apply design thinking to a broad range of challenges, from “shipping products to shipping people,” as he likes to put it.\nToday, he’s the VP of Brand Experience & Storytelling at\nIntuit\n, where he gets to, among other things, be a champion for small businesses—a cause close to his heart. Growing up, his double-immigrant parents opened multiple small businesses to support the family and carve out space for themselves in their new home countries. He’s able to understand and empathize with what small businesses are going through, first-hand.\nI sat down with Lionel to talk about how his personal background influences his work, how we can apply the tools of design thinking to develop empathy-driven experiences, and how we can create multi-sensory events—whether they’re in-person, virtual, or hybrid.\n‍\nJena: You have an unusual background for an events producer, not only in terms of your education, but also in terms of your personal story. How does this influence how you design experiences?\nLionel: I always say\nI have no business being in this role\n, yet I believe that my past and my experience actually contributes to a lot of the success that we've been having as a team.\nI was born in Iran, grew up in France, and later moved to the US. As someone who has to adapt to new environments, you have to shape a story of your experience and build empathy for different cultures. Also, you crave empathy as someone dealing with a challenging transition yourself. So empathy has always been core to my journey.\nSince I trained as a mechanical engineer, I started getting interested in how you apply engineering thinking to broader types of problems. In France, a lot of the public figures in government actually have a scientific or engineering background—which is different from the US where most politicians have a background in law. I always thought that I would be applying this engineering thinking to problems in society.\nI would say I still do engineering work everyday because I get to look at complex systems and understand how things are interconnected—just like looking at a machine. I also had to develop a skillset to help me simplify the complex and then communicate what we're trying to do to the masses. I don't do any CAD (computer-aided design) work anymore, but I rely on my engineering background to look at systems and their complexities.\nStorytelling has become the tool that I use to make the complex simple, get everybody to understand an idea, and be able to take action on it.\nJena: What does a “jaw-dropping experience” mean to you?\n‍\nLionel: I think it's about going above and beyond what people expect. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter what you do; what matters is how your audience feels. The outcome of a jaw-dropping experience is delight.\nAt the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what you do, what matters is how your audience\nfeels\n.\nTo be able to go above and beyond what your audience was expecting, you need to know them better than they know themselves. That requires a process. If you start with the intention of wanting to delight your audience, then the next step is to ask, ‘Well, who is that audience? What are they expecting? What do they need? What resonates with them?’ And then work your way towards crafting the vision of what you want to create.\nWe're at a time where we've never been equipped with more tools to host incredible experiences—whether they’re physical or digital or hybrid. We have the ability now to create these jaw-dropping moments, but that requires us to think deeply about our audience and our intentions.\nJena: What has the pandemic taught you about creating jaw-dropping experiences in a virtual environment? What lessons are you going to carry forward to future in-person and hybrid events?\nLionel: As we move into this world of hybrid, we have an opportunity to think about designing for all the senses and bringing different layers and dimensions into our events. We can work on not making it one-dimensional where attendees just sit in a chair, listening to the person on stage or watching a Zoom call. Connections, visuals, and sounds are all really important elements of that.\nAs we move into this world of hybrid, we have an opportunity to think about designing for all the senses and bringing different layers and dimensions into our events.\nOne example that comes to mind is our leadership conference this past year, where people were experiencing the content through our virtual events platform and the microsite we created, but 80 percent of the delight came from the community-building interactions on Slack.\nPeople were constantly Slack-ing each other in a forum to make sense of the content, to comment on content, and amplify some of the key moments of that content. And we just left going, ‘Oh my god, people can walk and chew gum at the same time.’ In the purely physical world, we’re used to turning off our computers, turning off our phones, not speaking to our neighbors—just listening to a speaker for three hours until you get to the Q&A. You can actually be a much more dynamic participant.\nWe questioned some long-held beliefs in the past year and we need to carry those lessons forward. You can actually use these things in a coordinated way so you create a jaw-dropping experience. The design challenge is going to be tremendous and it's going to take courage not to jump back to the old way. It's going to take discipline. But there are a lot of lessons and insights that we just can't leave behind.\n‍\nJena: How can event producers use design thinking to create better experiences?\n‍\nLionel: There are many ways to distill design thinking. I've gone through multiple ways of talking about it to clients when I was at IDEO, and I love how at Intuit we have created the version that makes sense to us. It's not the right answer for everyone, but we define design thinking as principles, rather than a process. We have three principles.\nFirst,\ndeep customer empathy\n. That's not just asking your audience what they want; it's more about knowing them—which means actually observing them, putting yourselves in their shoes, being in a place where you actually articulate their needs in ways that they can't always articulate themselves. Unfortunately, we often start with our stakeholders in our line of work. The CEO wants this, the VP wants this—but where we should focus our energy is: What does the audience need and what will resonate with them?\nSecond,\ngo broad to go narrow\n. In other words, we explore multiple directions before we narrow in on what we think is the best answer. I think about this as the ability to think about everything as a prototype. Everything can be thrown away—everything can be built upon. That iterative process gives us time to refine the thinking and create experiences that go beyond our own imagination.\nFinally,\nrapid experiments with customers\n. Try things very quickly; don't debate them forever. Take ideas to customers for feedback, run quick experiments, and get behavioral data. When it comes to virtual events, I always tell my team, ‘You can have the best vision and the most jaw-dropping experience in mind, but none of it matters if it's executed poorly.’ In a physical world, you can iterate on stage very quickly, you can refine in a green room—virtual is unforgiving that way. If production doesn't work, it doesn't work. You need to leave time for troubleshooting and experimenting with the technology so you can make sure that everything is seamless before the event.\nJena: How do you troubleshoot so you can ensure a seamless virtual experience for your audience?\nLionel: When you're so close to the work, you start making assumptions about how the audience will engage with it. You assume that if it makes sense to you, it's going to make sense to them. But that’s often not the case. The reality is you're way too close—you understand the intentions and you understand how you want to go from point A to point B.\nFind people in your organization who are part of your audience and create a pilot where you have them go through the experience end-to-end or ask them to accomplish a certain task and just observe. Don't explain, don't jump in, and don't try to help them get to resolution. Go in with an open mind, not with a defensive mind. At this point, it’s so easy to fall into the trap of dismissing the feedback and thinking, ‘Well that person just wasn’t paying attention,’ or ‘They’re just not tech savvy.’ Guess what? That’s your audience. You’re not going to get an audience of people who think just like you. You need to observe and understand your audience’s behaviors and see where things are falling through the cracks—then refine the experience accordingly.\nJena: One last question. Tell us your most controversial opinion about events.\nLionel: My perspective is we're not in the business of events. We're not even in the business of experiences, for that matter. To me, we're in the business of transformation. We're in the business of fundamentally shifting mindsets and behaviors by getting to people's hearts and minds. At the end of the day, people learn by doing. When they attend an event, they don't think, ‘Hey, the components of that experience were good.’ What they are left with is a feeling. What they do after the event solely depends on that feeling you’ve left them with.\nWe're not in the business of events...we're in the business of fundamentally shifting mindsets and behaviors by getting to people's hearts and minds.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/lionel-mohri-intuit-interview\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

Your event registration process should be too!\n‍\nMany steps need to happen before it's show-time. Getting attendees to fill out a form and sign-up is one of the first ones. When it comes to form design best practices, the phrase “less is more” often rings true. Every extra field you add will affect your conversion rate so you want to be selective and always consider why you're requesting certain information. Sometimes, you may already have the info you need, so for the sake of not being redundant, double-check if that's the case.\nThat being said, your events are unique to your company, and your event registration should be too. There will be times where standard fields like name, email, company, and title won't capture the type of information you're hoping to get. That's where custom registration fields come in.\n‍\nCustom Registration Fields\nWhether the point of your event is to generate leads, close sales or just keep your employees in the loop, having the ability to customize form fields gives you the flexibility to ask for information that can help tailor the attendee's experience. The additional information gathered can help inform your event with breakout preferences, ask an address for a gift, or even be necessary legal consent if you're planning to use their info.\nThe Nitty Gritty\nYou no longer need to rely on integrations with other registration software to customize registration fields. With Welcome, producers can add text fields, dropdowns, and checkboxes and determine if those fields should be required or not.\nWelcome makes the job of customizing your registration form dead simple. For example, to configure dropdown options, you just need to manage a line-separated text field. If you have a lot of options, you can simply paste them in! Also, Welcome checkboxes are flexible so you don’t have to be. We support multiple hyperlinks which are easy to add, remove or edit during the setup process.\nAt all times, you know what your registration form will look like because our registration form preview is live and in the same view where you customize your fields.\nAfter an event, attendee responses to your registration form are stored as event data and can be viewed and downloaded in the Attendees’  CSV file on the Welcome Event Dashboard.\n‍\nAbout Welcome\nFrom custom event registration to our state-of-the-art production studio, each of Welcome’s features adds up to provide a truly exceptional virtual experience platform. One that not only works seamlessly for an event of any size but delivers meaningful engagement and data-backed results—all while looking stunningly beautiful.

According to\nForrester\n, this makes employee experience\nthe\ndifferentiator in the coming year.\nBelow, we share 5 fun virtual team building activities that will help your team bond, establish trust, and deepen their collaborations. Find out what makes these activities work—then try them all to\ndesign an incredible employee experience\n!\nWhy Team Building Matters More When You’re Remote\nWhen you work in a traditional office, you have a chance of bumping into colleagues in the break room, seeing them in the hallways, and chatting with them before meetings.\nWithout those same interactions in the digital workspace, however, your team might feel disconnected, isolated, or disengaged. In a study conducted by\nBuffer\n, the top two concerns of remote workers were “collaboration and communication” and “loneliness.” Even more telling? These concerns have remained static since 2018!\nAs if that weren’t evidence enough, one study from\nGallup\neven found that employees with meaningful relationships at work, like a work best friend, were more productive, profitable, and creative. Isolation and lack of casual social interactions hurt everyone—but especially remote workers.\nIn this time of turn-over,\ncreating community in remote teams\nis one of the best strategies HR leaders have for retention and employee experience. By creating more opportunities for connection and collaboration throughout the work-day, you’ll shape the culture of your remote teams so any\nteam building activities\nyou hold are more fun—and more effective.\nHow a Greate Remote Employee Experience Fuels Team Building\nIf you can’t resort to a traditional “happy hour” or “Taco Truck Tuesday” event to bring your digital team closer together, how can you build community?\nGreat team building is about more than replicating splashy in-person events online. Instead, the real challenge is to build a strong digital culture that supports your day-to-day employee experiences.\nBut you don’t get stronger interpersonal connections by\nscheduling more meetings\nor loading down work calendars with extra-curriculars. Instead, consider the small, day-to-day strategies that will help you meet your community building goals. This might look like:\nPrioritizing introductions and low-stakes sharing during\nemployee onboarding\nand at the beginning of team check-ins.\nSlack channels for socializing, like a “water cooler” channel, as well as clubs or other social activities.\nOpen departmental meetings that encourage collaboration, cross-pollination, and team problem solving.\nCelebrating team role models during an\nall-hands meeting\nas part of an overall culture of employee recognition and gratitude.\nBy trying out more regular community building strategies, you’ll improve your employee experience across the board. After all, community goes to the very heart of your company culture. With strong digital practices in place, the team building activities you\ndo\nhold will feel more natural—and foster deeper, more meaningful connections.\n5 Virtual Team Building Activities—And Why They Work\nGood team building activities give employees a chance to collaborate, connect, and build trust. Playing low-stakes games, bonding over shared values, or taking the time to learn from one another will all help your team get even closer. Here are five of our favorite ideas—and what makes them work.\n1. Collaborative Games\nIs your team obsessed with Minecraft or Animal Crossing? You just might be able to leverage their love of video games to bring everyone closer together.\n‍\nBut don’t just launch your game night cold. Remember to plan for interested team members who might not have previous experience with the game—and give them time to acclimate. Better yet? Choose a familiar game, like\nScattergories\n, that’s easy to access from any platform.\nWhy it works:\nGames are a fun way to rally the troops, and you don’t have to be in-person to make it work. By choosing games with a collaborative element, you’ll inspire plenty of creative problem solving, all while providing a low stakes way for employees to get to know one another a little better.\nFor example, after\nForrester\nlaunched its own Minecraft team building exercise to help engage remote employees, they set some ground rules to make it work. Teams worked together to solve problems during the game, but the company nixed outright competition. That way, the emphasis was on creative problem solving and collaboration—not on winning.\n2. Virtual Volunteering\nDoes your company have a social mission? Or have you “adopted” a national nonprofit? Charitable efforts like fundraising or volunteering are a great way to unite your team around a common goal.\nTo make the activity work virtually, encourage your employees to get local with their volunteering or donation efforts. At work, don’t forget to:\nDedicate paid time off for volunteering hours\nCelebrate matching donations\nEncourage team members to share their causes, why they’re important, and any memories they have from their experiences.\nA distributed team is often viewed as a challenge. In this case, however, it’s a chance for your company to support causes that are near and dear to your employees’ hearts—and make it a part of your culture.\nWhy it works:\nMore than ever, employees are prioritizing their own values—especially when it comes to where they work. According to\nGartner\n’s Chief of Research, Chris Howard, “[the] pandemic has been a catalyst to elevate personal purpose and values.” Howard’s research shows that as many as 56% of employees want to contribute more to society.\nWhat if you can ensure their job is where that contribution will happen? Whether you’re raising money for a cause or tackling a day-long volunteer project, your team members get a chance to feel good doing values-based work. Plus, they’re working together to solve a problem in a brand new context, which gives you more opportunities to mix things up between departments or roles.\n3. Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) Sessions\nYour employees have a wealth of knowledge. Virtual Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) sessions let your team members show off their skills in new contexts. They’re also a great way to build connections across departments—and to informally recognize the talents you have at your company.\nConsider polling your team to see what kinds of skills and hobbies people are interested in learning. A few ideas to get you started include:\nDIY projects\nCreative skills, like photography, design, writing, or music\nCoding or engineering\nGardening\nSet aside some time each month for an AMA or build it into your Slack channels, so team members can share in less formal ways.\nWhy it works:\nEmployee recognition is crucial for building community. As many as 70% of employees\nfeel more connected\nto their peers when they’re recognized for their contributions to the company.\nBy giving your team a chance to be recognized for their skills—even if they’re indirectly related to their day-to-day work—you’re building a broader culture of recognition and support. When your team feels valued, they’re more likely to stick around.\n4. Lunch and Learn\nFrom soft skills to life skills, your employees are hungry to learn and improve. What better way to build camaraderie than to give them a space to learn together?\n‍\nLunch and Learn sessions might have a reputation for being boring, but you can easily liven them up with engaging virtual meeting strategies, like live Q&A or emoji reactions. You can even design an\nexperiential event\nwith pre-made taco kits, so everyone makes and eats the same lunch!\nDon’t forget to survey your team members to see what they’re itching to learn.\nWhy it works:\nA survey from\nMicrosoft\nfound that 80% of employees on the verge of quitting during the “Great Resignation” are concerned about advancing in their careers. Meanwhile, 74% of CEOs are\nworried about a skills gap\n.\nTaken together, these two statistics show that companies can do a lot more to address a perceived skills gap by reinvesting in the growth of their existing team. Not only will you build a more skilled workforce that can tackle your specific challenges, but you’ll also re-engage employees in their own work.\n5. Off-Site or On-Site Meet-Ups\nEven virtual teams need an occasional chance to meet in person and bond with their co-workers beyond the screen.\nIf you have a distributed team, choose a centralized location that’s easy for as many people as possible to get to. And make the event truly worthwhile! Here are a few of our favorite ideas:\nCompany-wide retreats that focus on bonding and the bigger, strategic picture\nGroup activities, like playing mini golf or tackling an escape room\nLow-key hikes or other outdoor activities\nIf you’re planning on making your off-site all about business or creative collaboration, be extra sensitive to people who may need to attend virtually and plan for a hybrid event.\nWhy it works:\nDespite craving the flexibility of remote work, as many as 55% of remote office workers miss interacting with their peers in the office. According to\nDropbox\n, who conducted the survey, remote workers found brainstorming challenges and other creative collaborations more difficult to tackle virtually.\nBringing your team together for an occasional in-person meeting or team-building activity will help those collaborations go more smoothly. Plus, your team can continue to build trust and make personal connections that will improve your day-to-day virtual or hybrid work.\nFinal Thoughts\nRemote team building activities might look a little different than what you’re used to, but the principle remains the same. Give your team meaningful time together to collaborate, solve creative problems, and build trust.\nMost importantly, it’s up to managers to build a daily remote working culture that supports monthly or quarterly team building efforts. By designing your\nremote work practices\nfor connection and collaboration, you’ll get the most out of team building time—and\nimprove your employee experience\nacross the board.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/virtual-team-building-activities\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

But not all of your attendees will be ready to give up virtual events. And for good reason! Virtual events are flexible, more accessible, and cost-effective for attendees.\nThese perks made virtual experiences the unexpected hit of 2020. By this point, some of our attendees might have Zoom fatigue, but they still enjoy participating in events all over the world without leaving their home offices. Until the risks of the pandemic subside, virtual events will also feel safer and more comfortable than braving large conference crowds.\nThis means you're left facing a whole new set of audience expectations—and audience journeys—for the events you're planning right now.\nMaybe you want to offer the same flexibility and accessibility to virtual guests while piloting a more intimate or exclusive in-person experience. Or maybe you still have to navigate real safety restrictions for in-person events and want to hold a hybrid event to extend your reach.\nWhatever your reason for tackling a hybrid event, it's crucial to create an incredible experience for both virtual and in-person guests. Here's what you need to know to make your transition into the hybrid event space a smashing success.\nWhat Makes a Hybrid Event \"Hybrid,\" Anyway?\nWhen it comes to hybrid events, there's no singular approach. But one thing's for sure—it takes twice as much work as putting on an in-person or a virtual event. Technically, you're planning two events at once!\nSome of your audience will attend in-person panels, networking events, and keynotes, while another portion of your audience joins from a virtual event platform. That means hybrid events often include one or more of the following experiences:\nWhether you tackle one of these ideas or the whole list, the possibilities for audience engagement are endless.\nThe \"hybrid\" part of your hybrid event can be as complex and innovative as the attendees you're trying to engage. Or it can be pared back, simple, and focused, allowing your virtual attendees to dig deep into a specific area of interest.\nIt might require a balancing act, but there are many take-aways from successful virtual events that apply to a new, hybrid experience.\nHow to Apply Lessons from Virtual Events to Your Hybrid Experience\nWe learned a lot about our audiences by embracing and creating exciting virtual events last year. Here are two major take-aways from 2020 to keep in mind as you plan your first hybrid events.\n1. Understand your audience\nThe more you can understand, empathize with, and incorporate feedback from your virtual audience members, the easier it will be to create hybrid content and audience journeys that appeal to them.\nAccording to Lionel Mohri, the VP of Brand Experience and Storytelling at Intuit, empathy is the key to unlocking a successful event or engagement strategy.\n‍\n\"We often start with our stakeholders in our line of work,\" Mohri\ntold us recently\n. \"The CEO wants this, the VP wants this—but where we should focus our energy is: What does the audience need and what will resonate with them?\"\nJumpstart your planning:\nWhat do you already know about how your audience consumes event content online?\nWhat keeps them engaged? What puts them to sleep?\nHow has your audience journey changed since the beginning of the pandemic?\nWhat do they most want to learn or do during a major event?\nHow can you verify your ideas through user surveys or other forms of feedback?\n2. Embrace the virtual experience\n‍\nIt can be frustrating when event organizers try to translate an ideal, in-person event strategy to an online experience. (And it\ndoesn't always work\n!)\nWhile your event production teams will still be juggling an in-person event schedule, there's no need to force your virtual attendees into a rigid, in-person structure.\nJumpstart your planning\n:\nWhat opportunities do you see to create new, hybrid audience journeys?\nWhen might a DIY audience experience, like picking and choosing events, work better than a linear schedule?\nWhat happens if you move \"optional\" experiences, like networking events, to the beginning or middle of your hybrid event, so they feel more valuable for everyone involved?\nThe more you consider your attendees' needs and embrace the fluidity of virtual experiences, the more engaging your hybrid event will be.\n3 Ways to Create a Jaw-Dropping Hybrid Experience\nNow that we know which engagement strategies work for virtual events, you can start planning for the challenges and opportunities of a hybrid experience.\nNo matter what your programming goal might be, a strong hybrid event strategy ensures that virtual attendees are just as excited and engaged as the guests who flew out to attend in person.\nBy creating more opportunities for connection, building an inclusive experience, and fully empowering a hybrid event production team, you'll\ndevelop a more cohesive, more engaging experience\nfor in-person and virtual attendees alike.\n1. Create Opportunities for Connection\n‍\nDigital overwhelm is real. Over the past year, weekly meetings have\nmore than doubled\n, and email and chat requests are up across the board.\nThat means it's more important than ever to use your arsenal of virtual engagement strategies in new and innovative ways. You'll create more opportunities for participants to engage with one another and the content of your event.\nFit virtual engagement strategies into your hybrid event\n.\n‍\nPolls, chat, breakout rooms, facilitated conversations, and dynamic, pre-recorded video all keep attendees' energy high. Just remember: each of these virtual engagement strategies require a dedicated facilitator to build further connections with your attendees.\nProvide pathways for connection between your attendees.\nWhat opportunities have you created for in-person attendees to engage with your virtual audience members? A shared Slack workspace, for example, could facilitate networking connections between your two audiences.\n‍\nProduce in-person content for virtual audiences, too.\nProduce your keynotes, panels, and other in-person events with virtual audiences in mind. Virtual attendees can still enjoy the live \"feel\" of an in-person audience, but only if the content is produced in a way that appeals to them.\n2. Build an Inclusive Experience\nThe pivot to virtual experiences in 2020 taught us all the ways we can design event experiences with inclusivity in mind.\nFrom diversifying your speakers to offering discounted tickets to virtual attendees, you can take advantage of the accessibility of hybrid events to engage a wider audience.\nDiversify your event speakers.\n‍\nConference keynote speakers can skew white and male, in large part because that's how we're socialized to\nthink about expertise\n. Make an effort to showcase new perspectives. From\nQueer Design Club\nto the\nAssociation of Asian American Investment Managers\n, many fields have affiliate groups for women, BIPOC, or LGBTQIA+ subject matter experts and thought leaders.\nOffer closed captioning or ASL interpretation\n.\nThanks to virtual events platforms, it's easier than ever to opt for closed captioning services during an online event. You can also hire ASL interpreters for in-person events and project their images alongside your speakers. Advocate for these services in your budget.\nEncourage attendees who are on a budget.\nIf your in-person roster of events is more exclusive, expensive, or valuable to attendees, balance it out for virtual attendees by offering a slight discount. Discounted tickets also help make your hybrid programs more accessible to attendees on a budget.\nAsk for feedback and make a plan to improve\n.\nNo matter your background, no one gets diversity and inclusion work \"right\" on the first try. Create pathways for event feedback and implement a plan for improving next time.\n3. Empower a Hybrid Team\nThis is the biggie.\nYour in-person events team is busy communicating your agenda to attendees, considering health restrictions, and thinking about speakers' itineraries. Not to mention setting up video production, preparing green rooms, and working with on-site vendors to ensure that everything's picture perfect day-of.\nThat's why you'll need to empower a dedicated hybrid team to consider your virtual attendees, too.\n‍\nBudget for your hybrid team.\nHybrid teams navigate many of the same concerns as in-person event producers. But they must also master an added layer of technical requirements, engagement strategies, and production needs. How can you set them up for success—including by providing an adequate budget?\n‍\n‍\nPrepare your speakers to consider both in-person and virtual attendees\n.\nEncourage your in-person production team to work closely with your hybrid production team to prepare speakers.\nThe speaking styles that only work \"in the room\" might not translate to livestream, or vice versa. Similarly, an in-person event might have virtual speakers dialing in. How can your event producers help those speakers feel well-prepped and included?\nPreparing for Your Hybrid Event\nAs you find ways for your hybrid event team and your in-person event producers to work together, you'll create an incredible experience for all attendees.\nThe more you prepare your speakers and your venue ahead of time to consider your virtual attendees, the easier it will be to handle any technical hiccups that come your way during your event.\nMake a back-up plan for your back-up plan\n.\nResolving technical issues quickly takes more than crazy-good WiFi. Both your in-person and your hybrid event producers have to practice and be prepared to troubleshoot on the fly.\n\"When it comes to virtual events, I always tell my team,\n‘You can have the best vision and the most jaw-dropping experience in mind, but none of it matters if it's executed poorly,’\n\" Mohri told us.\n\"In a physical world, you can iterate on stage very quickly, you can refine in a green room—virtual is unforgiving that way. If production doesn't work, it doesn't work. You need to leave time for troubleshooting and experimenting with the technology so you can make sure that everything is seamless before the event.\"\nPilot your experience\n.\nThe best way to troubleshoot ahead of a hybrid event is to hold a pilot program. This will help all the event producers on your team better anticipate your attendees' needs, whether they're part of a virtual or in-person audience.\n\"Find people in your organization who are part of your audience and create a pilot where you have them go through the experience end-to-end or ask them to accomplish a certain task and just observe,\" suggests Mohri. \"Don't explain, don't jump in, and don't try to help them get to resolution.\"\nOnce your pilot attendees help you identify the gaps in your experience, re-adjust ahead of launch.\nFinal Thoughts\nEmbracing hybrid events can feel like a tall order. It takes a ton of planning, a bigger team, and more room in your budget. But the rewards are greater, too. You get all the benefits of a virtual event, including a wider reach and a more diverse audience, as well as all the excitement of an exclusive, in-person experience.\nAs always, the key to a successful hybrid event lies in how well you design your experience for your attendees, whether they're digital participants or in-person guests. A hybrid experience can be just as memorable and meaningful as an in-person conference. And for the attendees who would have never been able to travel or attend the event in-person, your commitment to flexibility and accessibility will matter even more.\nAdditional Resources\n‍\nHow Intuit Uses Design Thinking to Create Empathetic Experiences\n‍\nWhat It Will Take to Improve Diversity at Conferences\n‍\nThere Is No Excuse for All-Male Panels.

After all, Zoom meetings feel impersonal, and it’s all too easy to misinterpret tone in the company Slack channel.\nEven if you’ve never met your colleagues in person, it’s crucial to find ways to get to know them and build your capacity to solve problems together. It may take more intention to build these moments into day-to-day remote work. But your efforts will be well worth it when you start to see better communication, more effective collaborations, and higher retention rates.\nWe recently hosted an event,\nLeading with Compassion: How to Support a Distributed Workplace\n, with Kim Rohrer from Oyster and Bobby Melloy from Culture Amp, where we explored the topic of how organizations can rise to these challenges and how despite being remote, they can build work environments that foster belonging, connection, and work-life balance.\nIf you missed the panel, you could watch the\nfull recording here\n. Since there wasn’t enough time to answer all the questions submitted by viewers, we decided to respond through a three-part post-webinar Q&A series. Oyster recently answered questions about\ncultivating well-being in a distributed workforce\n, and keep an eye out for Culture Amp's post about measuring employee engagement in a remote environment.\nFor Welcome’s post, we’re answering the question,\nhow do you cultivate team culture and facilitate staff getting to know each other outside of work-focused meetings?\nBelow, we’ve outlined five ways to build connection during day-to-day work, and five ways to improve connection through bigger team-building activities.\nLet’s dive in!\n5 Ways to Build Remote Culture & Connection During the Work Day\nThe better your team knows one another, the easier it will be to understand communication patterns and collaborate effectively. It takes time to build connections into the work day, but each of these suggestions will improve your team’s working relationships—and build your remote culture.\n1. Make time to get to know each other\nManagers create team dynamics, which means you have a lot of control over how you get to know your team—and how your team gets to know one another.\nIf you’re interested in helping your team build relationships that lead to better work, consider a few of the following tactics:\nLet people share.\nBuild in time to share weekend plans or other life updates at the beginning or end of your team syncs. If your agenda is too full, or you don’t open up the floor, you risk your team feeling disconnected from one another—and from you.\nAsk themed questions.\nLess comfortable with open-ended discussion? Try a round robin-style Q&A on a specific theme. Favorite conversation-starters include, “What job did you want when you were growing up?” and “What non-career goal are you working toward right now?”\nTake it to Slack.\nKeep the conversation going outside of your weekly or daily syncs by starting affinity-based Slack channels devoted to cooking, pets, or TV. Give people spaces to share what they’re watching or listening to, even if it’s not strictly work-related.\nRemember, says Kim Rohrer, Head of Employee Experience at\nOyster\n, work culture isn’t just gathering together outside of work-focused meetings. “It’s how you run your meetings. It’s how you assign work. It’s how you promote. That is all culture.”\n2. Spotlight your new hires\nIt’s always hard to be the new kid on the block. That’s especially true when you’re hired for a remote position or a remote company.\nMake it easier for your new hires to get to know their colleagues, so they can start building the connections that are so important to meaningful, engaged work. You can:\nIntroduce them during your all-hands meeting via a fun ice-breaker, like “Two Truths & A Lie”\nSet up quick informational meetings with colleagues across departments\nMatch them up with an onboarding buddy for extra support\nNew hires make decisions about their company within the first six months, which makes onboarding a crucial time to create relationships with new colleagues.\n3. Departmental AMAs\nMaybe your direct reports are doing great, and you’ve got the remote team syncs down to a “T.” How are you building relationships with other members of your company, especially if your team is cross-functional?\nDuring remote work, it’s all too easy to become more siloed instead of more connected. To help encourage communication across departments, consider hosting a weekly or monthly departmental “ask me anything” session, or AMA.\nFor example, your sales team might share the customer questions they’re fielding on the regular, or your engineering team might give everyone a peek into critical feature updates.\nBy opening up the communication channels, your entire company will have a better understanding of mission, vision, and cross-team collaboration efforts that lead to better engagement.\n4. Mentorship programs\nDemonstrating that you care about your team members’ career development is an incredible way to establish more meaningful relationships.\nIn fact, as many as\n65% of employees\nsurveyed by the workforce agility platform Gloat at the beginning of the Great Resignation said that their current employer didn’t offer the kinds of employment opportunities for advancement they expected.\nWhether you take the time to mentor your team members individually or establish a more formal mentorship program at your company, it pays to invest in understanding what your team members want to do—and where they want to go next in their careers.\n5. Better all-hands meetings\nBetween the internal syncs and cross-departmental touch bases, you might be meeting-ed out. But don’t underestimate how important\nall-hands meetings\nare for building connection, both at an organizational level and on a personal level.\n“What I tend to see across organizational data over the past eight months is that communication has become the number one driver of employee engagement,” said Bobby Melloy, Regional Director of People Science at\nCulture Amp\n. “Part of the reason is because people are using communications to understand what the future is for the organization, both in the near-term and then over the long-term.”\nAll-hands meetings\nare the place where organizational communication happens in an engaging way, so your team stays inspired and focused on the mission. By using a tool like\nWelcome\n, you can add the personal touches that make all-hands meetings more fun. This includes features like\nLounge Room\n, which give your team members a chance to connect and watch an all-hands meeting together.\n5 Remote Team-Building Ideas to Transform Your Connections\nTo build successful remote teams, team-building must be an intentional goal, too. This can be difficult for busy start-ups or short-staffed organizations where every moment counts—especially when quality team-building time doesn't always look like “work.” In fact, some of the best\nremote team-building activities\ndon’t resemble work at all!\nBut they are time well-spent. Team-building activities produce stronger, more connected teams who collaborate and solve problems together more effectively day-to-day. You just have to make time for them in your team’s busy schedule. Here are a few of our favorites:\n1. Wellness experiences\nWhen as many as\n49% of workers\nidentify as burned out, there’s huge value in hitting the pause button. Whether you schedule a yoga and meditation exercise, chat about\nfeng shui\n, or\ngo on a virtual safari\n, it’s important to build in time to re-center and come together as a team. Thankfully,\nWelcome\nmakes it easy for you and your team to focus on\nexperiential events\nthat boost wellness, whether that’s for an hour or a day-long retreat!\n2. After-hours adventures\nFrom movie nights to Zoom happy hour, find ways for your team to connect when they can really put their work down and enjoy themselves. In the shift to remote work,\n44% of employees\nfeared loss of community and connection with their colleagues, which makes after-work bonding experiences more important than ever.\n3. Games\nProblem-solving games like virtual escape rooms can be great\nremote team-building activities\n. Any game that gets your team working together to creatively solve a problem will build the kinds of connections they need to collaborate effectively during regular work hours, too.\n4. Clubs\nFrom pet owners to parents, your workplace is filled with potential affinity groups that may wish to connect. These groups may even transform into full-fledged clubs, whether that’s a book club, art club, or movie club. The sky’s the limit!\n5. In-person meetings\nLast but not least, gathering in person is still important—even for remote teams. Whether you schedule a large retreat for the entire company or a small-scale retreat for individual teams, in-person time will help your team bond more quickly.\nWant more in-person touch points for team members outside of retreats? Consider establishing local or regional networking. That way, colleagues in the same city or area can meet up for coffee, co-work, or just be available to one another as resources.\nFinal Thoughts\nIt takes time and intention to build the kinds of connections that lead to incredible remote collaboration. But it can be done! Especially if you’re balancing casual relationship-building during your day-to-day tasks with bigger, more social efforts and events. It’s all for the culture!\nWelcome\nis employee event software that supports your entire employee lifecycle.

This is especially true for\nremote employee onboarding\nexperiences.\nYour new hires must navigate a new work culture with new norms, make relationships quickly, and begin working on projects—all with little-to-no in-person contact. It’s a big lift—and it’s disastrous if you get it wrong.\nOnboarding makes a huge difference in employee retention and engagement. In fact,\n69% of employees\nare more likely to stay with a company for three years if they have an incredible onboarding experience.\nSo how do we design remote onboarding that keeps employees excited about their new position while setting them up for future success?\nFor Laura Del Beccaro, co-founder and CEO of\nSora\n, it’s all about hitting four major goals:\nExcitement\n— Engage your new hire so they feel confident that they made the right decision.\nIntroduction\n— Help them understand how your company works.\nIntegration\n— Find meaningful ways to introduce them to the rest of the team and build social relationships.\nRamp\n— Set them up for success in their role and equip them properly for the work ahead.\nIf you can identify new hire milestones that align with each of those goals in the first 30, 60, and 90 days of their contract, you’ll be well on your way to designing a better onboarding experience for everyone.\n5 Best Practices for Employee Onboarding\nIn our recent event,\nEngage & Retain Employees Through Good Onboarding\n, Del Beccaro joined Craig Sabol, former Executive Director of People Operations & Analytics at\nMyovant Sciences\n, to discuss employee onboarding best practices for better retention, engagement, and productivity.\nHere are 5 event take-aways that can help you build and scale the best onboarding experience for your distributed team:\nEmployee engagement\nbegins before their start date. Make your new hires feel comfortable and anticipate their questions or first-week needs.\nInvest in helping your new hires get to know the people in your organization—before they hit the ground running with their major projects.\nScale your\nonboarding process\nin as human a way as possible. Automating tasks doesn’t mean your organization has to sound like a robot.\nCollaborate with your managers and department heads to ensure that your employee onboarding is consistent.\nMix engaging, fun activities with compliance tasks to keep your new hires from feeling overwhelmed.\n‍\nWatch the full event\nhere\nfor more insights about employee onboarding.\nEmployee Engagement Begins Before the Start Date\nIt’s not always easy to anticipate the biggest questions on your new hire’s mind, said Del Beccaro.\n“A lot of our employees ask what they should wear, even though we're a fully distributed company,” she shared. “I never would have thought of that. There's a lot of engagement that needs to happen before the start date.”\nSabol agreed. “I think new hires are really trying to understand the norms of the organization,” he said. “Often, you don't pick up on those norms until you start seeing how other people work.”\nAs long-time employees or managers, it’s easy to take these norms for granted. Tap into existing relationships your new hire has developed with recruiters or hiring managers to help them ease into their new position.\nAt Sora, for example, new hires are assigned an “onboarding buddy” that serves as their primary relationship throughout the experience. Employees also get a sneak-peek of their calendars, so they can begin prepping for their first week.\n‍\nBalance Fun, Work, and Relationship-Building throughout the Onboarding Process\nWhen you’re a brand new employee, there’s a lot of paperwork to get through—and not all of it’s fun. From sexual harrassment trainings to benefits enrollment, navigating onboarding can be stressful or overwhelming.\nFor Sabol, that means striking a balance between compliance-related tasks and fun to-dos, like ordering company swag or recording an introductory video for a company\nall-hands meeting\n.\nInstead of ramping his new hires directly into work, Sabol prioritized relationship-building. “Some of our new hires will facilitate up to 60 meet-and-greets,” he said.\n“That may sound overwhelming, but we often get really good feedback,” he added. “Because when you get individuals talking one-on-one, that's when your new hire is going to pick up on, ‘Oh, what does that person do? What are some of those norms?’”\nWhether you schedule a mountain of meet-and-greets or assign your new hire an onboarding buddy, helping them develop social connections is crucial to their future success. As Sabol suggested, don’t be afraid to slow down and give those relationships time to develop.\nRemember, you can always assess at the 90-day mark using an\nemployee survey\nto evaluate feedback and continue iterating on your onboarding process!\nScale Employee Onboarding with a Human Touch\nAs your company grows, you’ll need to find new ways to deliver a consistent\nemployee onboarding experience\nby automating time-consuming tasks and collaborating with managers.\nAccording to Sabol, automation has allowed his team to focus on building a more human onboarding process. “You don't want to automate it so that it feels like a machine and you lose the personal touch,” he said.\n“Automation allowed our team to focus more on the curation of the benefits or the day-one orientation,” added Sabol. “It's about focusing on the right work, not so much the manual work.”\nThere’s an up-front cost to working this way, admitted Del Beccaro, but it engages HR managers and department heads in the process, while ensuring consistency for new hires.\nAt Sora, Del Beccaro uses automated emails, task management, and other plug-and-play templates to help motivate department heads to remain engaged throughout onboarding.\nFor example, if employees respond to automated emails, they always get a response from a real person. And if managers need to respond to new hire questions, they already have templates to work from to make the task less time-consuming.\n“Make it easy and fun and a little more digestible,” Del Beccaro suggested. “That requires upfront planning and thoughtfulness, but it pays a lot of dividends in the end.”\nFinal Thoughts\nYour\nremote onboarding experience\nhas a lot riding on its shoulders. Keeping new hires excited and engaged as they build new relationships and ramp up on projects will ensure their success—and the success of your entire team.\nWelcome\nis employee event software that supports the entire employee lifecycle, including\nremote onboarding\nevents.

The terms of this DPA shall survive for so long as Company continues to retain any Personal Data.\n‍\n9. Sub-processing.\n‍\nCustomer hereby authorizes Company to engage Sub-processors to Process Personal Data on Customer's behalf, including the Sub-processors currently engaged by Company. Company shall: (i) take commercially reasonable measures to ensure that Sub-processors have the requisite capabilities to Process Personal Data in accordance with this DPA; (ii) enter into a written agreement with each Sub-processor that requires the Sub-processor to protect the Personal Data to the same standard required by this DPA; and (iii) remain responsible for its compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of the Sub-processor that cause Company to breach any of its obligations under this DPA.

Audits and Inspections\n.\nCompany shall provide written responses (on a confidential basis) to all commercially reasonable requests for information made by Customer regarding Processing of Personal Data, including responses to information security reviews, that are necessary to confirm Company’s compliance with this DPA.

Law Enforcement Requests\n.\nIf a law enforcement or other governmental agency sends Company a request or other lawful process for Personal Data (for example, a subpoena or court order), Company may attempt to redirect the agency to request that data directly from Customer. As part of this effort, Company may provide Customer’s basic contact information to the law enforcement agency. If compelled to disclose Personal Data to a law enforcement agency, then Company shall give Customer reasonable notice of the demand to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy unless Company is legally prohibited from doing so.\n‍\n16. Customer Obligations\n.\nCustomer shall ensure that Customer is entitled to transfer the relevant Personal Data to Company so that Company may lawfully use, process, and transfer the Personal Data in accordance with the Agreement on the Customer’s behalf.

Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).\n8.6   Security of processing\n(a) The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.\n(b) The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.\n(c) In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.\n(d) The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.\n8.7   Sensitive data\nWhere the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.\n8.8   Onward transfers\nThe data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union () (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward transfer’) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:\n(i) the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;\n(ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;\n(iii) the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or\n(iv) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.\nAny onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.\n8.9   Documentation and compliance\n(a) The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the processing under these Clauses.\n(b) The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.\n(c) The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter’s request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.\n(d) The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.\n(e) The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.\nClause 9\nUse of sub-processors\n(a) The data importer has the data exporter’s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least thirty (30) days in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.\n(b) Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects. () The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.\n(c) The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter’s request, a copy of such a sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the data exporter. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.\n(d) The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations under its contract with the data importer. The data importer shall notify the data exporter of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract.\n(e) The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby – in the event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent – the data exporter shall have the right to terminate the sub-processor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.\nClause 10\nData subject rights\n(a)\nThe data importer shall promptly notify the data exporter of any request it has received from a data subject. It shall not respond to that request itself unless it has been authorised to do so by the data exporter.\n(b) The data importer shall assist the data exporter in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects’ requests for the exercise of their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In this regard, the Parties shall set out in Annex II the appropriate technical and organisational measures, taking into account the nature of the processing, by which the assistance shall be provided, as well as the scope and the extent of the assistance required.\n(c) In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the instructions from the data exporter.\nClause 11\nRedress\n(a) The data importer shall inform data subjects in a transparent and easily accessible format, through individual notice or on its website, of a contact point authorised to handle complaints. It shall deal promptly with any complaints it receives from a data subject.\n(b) In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these Clauses, that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a timely fashion. The Parties shall keep each other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate, cooperate in resolving them.\n(c) Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer shall accept the decision of the data subject to:\n(i) lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the Member State of his/her habitual residence or place of work, or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13;\n(ii) refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.\n(d) The Parties accept that the data subject may be represented by a not-for-profit body, organisation or association under the conditions set out in Article 80(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n(e) The data importer shall abide by a decision that is binding under the applicable EU or Member State law.\n(f) The data importer agrees that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice his/her substantive and procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with applicable laws.\nClause 12\nLiability\n(a) Each Party shall be liable to the other Party/ies for any damages it causes the other Party/ies by any breach of these Clauses.\n(b) The data importer shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data importer or its sub-processor causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses.\n(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the data exporter shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data exporter or the data importer (or its sub-processor) causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses. This is without prejudice to the liability of the data exporter and, where the data exporter is a processor acting on behalf of a controller, to the liability of the controller under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as applicable.\n(d) The Parties agree that if the data exporter is held liable under paragraph (c) for damages caused by the data importer (or its sub-processor), it shall be entitled to claim back from the data importer that part of the compensation corresponding to the data importer’s responsibility for the damage.\n(e) Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to the data subject as a result of a breach of these Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally liable and the data subject is entitled to bring an action in court against any of these Parties.\n(f) The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable under paragraph (e), it shall be entitled to claim back from the other Party/ies that part of the compensation corresponding to its/their responsibility for the damage.\n(g) The data importer may not invoke the conduct of a sub-processor to avoid its own liability.\nClause 13\nSupervision\nWhere the data exporter is established in an EU Member State:] The supervisory authority with responsibility for ensuring compliance by the data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards the data transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.\nWhere the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) and has appointed a representative pursuant to Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:] The supervisory authority of the Member State in which the representative within the meaning of Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is established, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.\nWhere the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) without however having to appoint a representative pursuant to Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:] The supervisory authority of one of the Member States in which the data subjects whose personal data is transferred under these Clauses in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are located, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.\n(b) The data importer agrees to submit itself to the jurisdiction of and cooperate with the competent supervisory authority in any procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer agrees to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory authority, including remedial and compensatory measures. It shall provide the supervisory authority with written confirmation that the necessary actions have been taken.\nSECTION III – LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES\nClause 14\nLocal laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses\n(a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.\n(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:\n(i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;\n(ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards ();\n(iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.\n(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.\n(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.\n(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).\n(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.\nClause 15\nObligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities\n15.1   Notification\n(a) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:\n(i) receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or\n(ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.\n(b) If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.\n(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).\n(d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.\n(e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.\n15.2   Review of legality and data minimisation\n(a) The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).\n(b) The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.\n(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.\nSECTION IV – FINAL PROVISIONS\nClause 16\nNon-compliance with the Clauses and termination\n(a) The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.\n(b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).\n(c) The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:\n(i) the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;\n(ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or\n(iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.\nIn these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.\n(d) Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data. The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.\n(e) Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\nClause 17\nGoverning law\nThese Clauses shall be governed by the law of the EU Member State in which the data exporter is established. Where such law does not allow for third-party beneficiary rights, they shall be governed by the law of another EU Member State that does allow for third-party beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that this shall be the law of Ireland.\nClause 18\nChoice of forum and jurisdiction\n(a) Any dispute arising from these Clauses shall be resolved by the courts of an EU Member State.\n(b) The Parties agree that those shall be the courts of Ireland.\n(c) A data subject may also bring legal proceedings against the data exporter and/or data importer before the courts of the Member State in which he/she has his/her habitual residence.\n(d) The Parties agree to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of such courts.\nAPPENDIX\nANNEX I\nA.   LIST OF PARTIES\nData exporter(s):\nName:\nThe entity identified as “Customer” in the Agreement.\nAddress:\nThe address for Customer specified in the Agreement.\nContact person’s name, position and contact details:\nThe contact details specified in the Agreement\nActivities relevant to the data transferred under these Clauses:\nCustomer’s use of the Services provided by the data importer pursuant to the Agreement.\nSignature and date:\nBy executing the Agreement, the data exporter will be deemed to have signed this Annex I.\nRole (controller/processor):\nController\nData importer(s):\nName:\nGather Wholesale, Inc. (d/b/a Welcome) with a place of business at\nAddress:\n440 N. Barranca Ave\n#8588\nCovina, CA 91723\nContact person’s name, position and contact details:\nJonathan Kim, Solutions Engineer, jonathan@experiencewelcome.com\nActivities relevant to the data transferred under these Clauses:\nProvision of the Services to the data exporter pursuant to the Agreement.\nSignature and date:\nBy executing the Agreement, the data exporter will be deemed to have signed this Annex I.\nRole (controller/processor):\nProcessor.\nB.   DESCRIPTION OF TRANSFER\nCategories of data subjects whose personal data is transferred\nThe Categories of Data subjects are specified in Schedule 1 to the DPA.\nCategories of personal data transferred\nThe categories of personal data transferred are described in Schedule 1 to the DPA.\nSensitive data transferred (if applicable) and applied restrictions or safeguards that fully take into consideration the nature of the data and the risks involved, such as for instance strict purpose limitation, access restrictions (including access only for staff having followed specialised training), keeping a record of access to the data, restrictions for onward transfers or additional security measures.\nSpecial categories of Personal Data transferred, if any, are described in Schedule 1 to the DPA.  The safeguards applied to such Personal Data are described in Schedule 2 to the DPA.\nThe frequency of the transfer (e.g. whether the data is transferred on a one-off or continuous basis).\nPersonal Data may be transferred on a continuous basis during the Term of the Agreement.\nNature of the processing\nThe nature of the processing is the data importer’s performance of the Services under the Agreement, including for the purposes of: (a) setting up, operating, monitoring, and providing the Services; (b) communicating with Users; and (d) executing other agreed-upon written instructions of the data exporter.\nPurpose(s) of the data transfer and further processing\nThe purpose of the data transfer and further processing is the data importer’s performance of the Services under the Agreement\nThe period for which the personal data will be retained, or, if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period\nPersonal Data will be retained for the duration of the Agreement and subject to Section 7 (Return or Deletion of Personal Data) of the DPA\nFor transfers to (sub-) processors, also specify subject matter, nature and duration of the processing\nThe subject matter, nature, and duration of processing undertaken by sub-processors will be the same as set forth in this Annex 1.B with respect to the data importer.\nC.   COMPETENT SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY\nIdentify the competent supervisory authority/ies in accordance with Clause 13\nThe competent supervisory authority will be the supervisory authority that has supervision over the data exporter in accordance with Clause 13.\nANNEX II\nTECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF THE DATA\nThe technical and organizational measures adopted by the data importer are set forth in Schedule 2 to the DPA.\n-----------------\nWhere the data exporter is a processor subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 acting on behalf of a Union institution or body as controller, reliance on these Clauses when engaging another processor (sub-processing) not subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 also ensures compliance with Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39), to the extent these Clauses and the data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor pursuant to Article 29(3) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 are aligned. This will in particular be the case where the controller and processor rely on the standard contractual clauses included in Decision 2021/915.\nThe Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union’s internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose of these Clauses.\nThis requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor acceding to these Clauses under the appropriate Module, in accordance with Clause 7.\nAs regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with these Clauses, different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment. Such elements may include relevant and documented practical experience with prior instances of requests for disclosure from public authorities, or the absence of such requests, covering a sufficiently representative time-frame. This refers in particular to internal records or other documentation, drawn up on a continuous basis in accordance with due diligence and certified at senior management level, provided that this information can be lawfully shared with third parties. Where this practical experience is relied upon to conclude that the data importer will not be prevented from complying with these Clauses, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective elements, and it is for the Parties to consider carefully whether these elements together carry sufficient weight, in terms of their reliability and representativeness, to support this conclusion. In particular, the Parties have to take into account whether their practical experience is corroborated and not contradicted by publicly available or otherwise accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence of requests within the same sector and/or the application of the law in practice, such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies.\n‍"}

Whether you’re ready to overhaul your onboarding process for virtual employees or permanently shift your work-from-home policies to accommodate parenting, these are the 10 things you can put on your to-do list to make a big impact on employee experience this year.\n1. Survey Your Team\nThe new year is the perfect time to check in with your team. Research shows that most companies don’t have a strong sense of their employees’ day-to-day experiences.\nIn fact, according to\nGartner\n, as many as 29% of employees feel that HR doesn’t understand their needs. What’s worse, employees are skeptical of sentiment surveys. “Surveys are great, but sometimes we are limited by only asking questions that HR thinks are important,” one HR employee responded to the Gartner\nsurvey\n.\nIt’s time to change your approach to the employee survey in 2022:\nAsk your team to weigh in more frequently, whether that’s during an\nall-hands meeting\nor a quarterly sales meeting\nDesign open-ended questions for more qualitative answers\nHave employees rank priorities or needs\nMost importantly, make a plan for how you will use the results of your survey—and be transparent. You can only improve employee experience if you take measures to address real problems and stay accountable to your team every step of the way.\n2. Invest in Technology\nWhen employees don’t have the tools they need to get the job done, overall job satisfaction dips. According to\nFuture Forum\n, companies that adequately financed the switch to remote work during the pandemic had employees who were 54% more productive and 2x more likely to feel a sense of belonging.\nIn 2022, we’ll still be navigating hybrid work policies. But now we have more experience with the realities of hybrid work to draw from as we re-assess the technology needs of our team. Important questions to ask include:\nDo all of your employees have the tools they need to do their job well—from anywhere?\nHow can you apply what you learned in 2021 to onboarding new employees?\nHow can you use existing tools, like your virtual event software, to increase a sense of belonging and purpose?\nWhether you’re designing brick-and-mortar spaces for team collaboration or sending out company-owned laptops for remote employees, tech investments will lead to increased productivity, satisfaction, and engagement.\n3. Support New Hires\nWe’ll still be navigating “The Great Resignation” throughout the new year. With talent at a premium, upgrading your\nonboarding process\nwill pay off in dividends.\nWhile it’s important to highlight\ncompany culture\nand values during onboarding, new hires also need support:\nUnderstanding their role and responsibilities\nMaking relationships with team members in their own and other departments\nAnswering questions\nNavigating new company technology\nFeeling empowered within their role\nThe list goes on! And the need for support doesn't end after the first week or month. Especially when you're working virtually, you'll have to work harder to communicate with new hires via chat, video, or email—whether that's to provide meaningful feedback or just check in.\nBy returning to these support areas multiple times within the first year, you'll improve employee retention and engagement.\n4. Consider the Needs of Parents\nWithout standard parental leave in the U.S., the needs of working parents are often swept under the rug. According to McKinsey, parents are at\ngreater risk of leaving their jobs\nright now, due to high burn-out rates and the need for increased flexibility.\nAt its heart, this is also a DEI issue—more BIPOC parents are considering leaving the workplace than white parents. If you want to ensure that your organization stays inclusive, parenting policies will require your attention next year.\nThankfully, virtual and hybrid work have shown us how to better accommodate parents in 2022. To be proactive, competitive, and equitable on an issue that touches the lives of your team, consider:\nImplementing paid family leave for new parents\nProviding adequate internal support as new parents transition to leave\nOffering flexible working hours\nAcknowledging and respecting caring duties\nProviding stipends for child care\nYour policies will affect how well working parents can tackle their jobs and still feel like part of the team. If you want to improve your employee experience, reducing the stress of parents is a great place to start.\n5. Help Employees Grow\nLeaders in human resources have identified career growth and professional learning as a top trend for job seekers heading into 2022. In fact,\nLinkedIn\nrecently discovered that opportunities to learn and grow rocketed to the top of company culture drivers in 2020, beating out values like “belonging” and “collaboration.”\nWith\n\"The Great Resignation\"\nin full swing, you can't afford to lose top talent. Thankfully, the right virtual event software can support more engaging management training or upskilling sessions. With\nrobust polling\n, graphic overlays, and real-time Q&A on the virtual stage, you can provide employees with the skills they need to get ahead.\nGrowth and learning happens in day-to-day work experiences, too. The more your managers support employees’ desire to learn and improve with feedback, resources, and complex projects, the more engaged and satisfied your employees will be next year.\n6. Build Better Relationships\nLast year, many companies started to change their approach to the physical office. By building more spaces for collaboration, rather than independent work, the office place can facilitate the one-to-one connections we miss during virtual and hybrid work.\nWe expect these trends to continue into 2022 and beyond, which means leaders will still be asked to help employees make connections with one another online. Here are a few tips for creating virtual community:\nFacilitating introductions for new team members\nEncouraging virtual open office hours\nCreating Slack channels devoted to water cooler chats or social clubs\nProviding your teams with more autonomy in virtual event watch rooms or DMs\nFrom a company-wide standpoint, leaders can build better relationships with the entire team during\nall-hands meetings\n. By clearly communicating goals, celebrating milestones, and fielding questions in real time, your team will feel more connected than ever to leadership—and to your company’s business goals for 2022.\n7. Empower Your Workers\nAmidst fears that workers would take advantage of remote and hybrid work, some managers became\nmicro\nmanagers. The problem is persistent enough that\nGartner\nrecently released a guide to avoiding micromanagement during remote work.\nBecause it leads to lower engagement, productivity, and engagement, it’s time to ditch excessive check-ins for employee empowerment and autonomy. In virtual and hybrid work, this doesn’t necessarily mean taking a “hands-off” approach. Instead, it means managers must:\nAsk questions about employee needs, passions, and engagement\nProvide resources for collaboration and creative problem solving\nMake room for employee ideas and feedback\nBuild trust with individual employees and among team members\nWhen employees feel empowered to pursue their work with more freedom and agency, your whole team benefits—and your company culture shifts for the better.\n8. Shower Your Team with Praise\nLack of recognition drives employees from their positions at record rates. In fact, a major survey conducted by\nMcKinsey\nshows that “The Great Resignation” is being driven by employees who feel their managers and their company don’t value their contributions to the team.\nIn order to improve your employee experience next year, build recognition into your team’s day-to-day.\nSpotlight outstanding contributions on your virtual stage during an all-hands meeting\nProvide positive feedback during team meetings or one-on-ones\nBuild a culture of team feedback by encouraging colleagues to shout out the team members who have done a great job\nReward great work with bonuses, paid time off, or other incentives\nThe more your team understands how their role contributes to the company, the more valued and engaged they’ll be as you kick off a new year of business goals.\n9. Over-Communicate. No, Really!\nYour team craves clarity. Confusion around roles and responsibilities or even a company transition can lead to uncertainty and lack of productivity. So when it comes to company-wide communication, the more you share, document, and confirm—the better!\nAll-hands meetings\n, in particular, are a great way to set a high bar for communication and transparency. Whether you’re reviewing quarterly sales goals or rallying the team ahead of your next work sprint, use all the tools in your virtual event toolkit to eliminate confusion and build excitement.\nGraphic overlays quickly communicate major goals or milestones\nReal-time polls identify outlying questions or concerns from your team\nLive Q&A features give everyone a chance to bring questions to leadership\nRecording your meetings helps deliver content asynchronously to the whole company\nGive your team more clarity and purpose in 2022 to improve your employee experience and boost engagement across the board.\n10. Put Your Values Out There\nValues matter to your team. As many as\n70% of employees\nfeel that their sense of purpose is defined by work. That means it’s crucial for companies to help employees feel more connected to a shared mission or values. In fact, when employees feel their role has a purpose, they’re more engaged—and productive.\nWhile corporate responsibility is important, today’s workers are thinking beyond core values like “sustainability”or “community engagement.” They’re also thinking about your company culture as a whole—and how their work supports a culture they can believe in.\nShare your values regularly, and tie specific actions to them. If you value collaboration, how can you create or celebrate moments of collaboration throughout the year, whether that’s during an all-hands meeting or on Slack?\nFinding ways to enact company values builds overall culture—and demonstrates to your team that these values are an important part of getting work done, together.\nFinal Thoughts\nTo retain top talent and improve belonging in another year of virtual and hybrid work, invest in a better employee experience. Take the time to thoughtfully survey your teams about their day-to-day needs and experiences, so you know exactly what you can improve in 2022.\nWith built-in tools, you can use virtual meeting software to foster belonging, communicate major business goals, and reward hard-working employees. After all, the more you do to keep your team happy, engaged, and productive, the better your employee experience will be.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/improve-employee-experience-2022\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

What will be permanent? Remote work—and companies that understand how to\novercome the challenges\nof a hybrid workplace.\nThis means it’s time for managers of all stripes to think more seriously about what their employees want and how to tie these needs to the best possible\nemployee experience\n. We’re entering into an ‘Employee Era,’ where employee experience shapes remote work culture—not the other way around.\nBelow, discover the 7 things your remote employees want most—and why you should want them, too.\n1. Flexibility\nThere’s a reason you keep hearing this word. According to\nLinkedIn data\n, the appearance of the term has jumped by more than 362% in member posts over the last year alone!\nFrom flex hours to family leave, remote and hybrid employees understand the value of being able to work on your own schedule. They expect their employers to be less rigid about 9-to-5 schedules and “back to the office” work plans, too.\nAnd it’s no wonder why. According to a major study conducted by\nAsana\n, 25% of employees experienced burnout one or more times last year, and 40% believe that burnout is the cost of success at work.\nUnfortunately, too many meetings and notifications are starting to cancel out all the gains we’ve seen in productivity—and burnout is eating away at worker motivations. By honoring employees’ boundaries, scheduling company-wide “no meeting days,” and thinking more creatively about employee engagement, you can become a more flexible workplace—and a healthier one, too.\n‍\nTech tip:\nEven if everyone on your team is working on a different schedule, you still need time to gather. As an employee event platform, Welcome is your gathering spot and your company auditorium rolled into one. Meet any time, anywhere for an energizing\nall-hands meeting\n. Or hold an\nexperiential event\nthat offers your team real ways to combat burnout and build community.\n‍\n25% of employees experienced burnout one or more times last year, and 40% believe that burnout is the cost of success at work. -Asana\n2. Equitable Experiences\nAn overwhelming number of employees don’t feel valued in their current positions. What’s worse—employers don’t suspect this problem is driving the Great Reshuffle at all! According to\nMcKinsey\n, “employers seem to overlook the relational elements that are key drivers for why employees are leaving, such as lack of belonging or feeling valued at work.”\nIn many ways, the switch to virtual and hybrid work has exacerbated the issue. After all, it can be too easy for managers and leaders to gloss over meaningful work contributions in a virtual setting—and inadvertently create inequitable work experiences to boot.\nThat’s why it’s crucial to make your team feel seen, known, and valued for their contributions in as many channels as possible. By keeping tabs on who is working hard and who has access to the type of work that leads to a promotion, you’ll\nmake your employees’ experiences more equitable\n.\nManagers and people leaders must also examine biases about real-life challenges, like working parents with irregular childcare access or an inability to travel for in-person meetings. How does your company accommodate these realities? Clearly document your policies around roles, expectations, and meaningful output to ensure your remote work culture is as equitable as possible.\n‍\nTech tip:\nDuring in-person meetings, it’s all too easy for extroverted employees to hold the floor. Give your employees a more equitable experience in hybrid work environments by making it easy for them to raise their hand with a question during virtual meetings.\nWelcome\nhelps you give your audience the floor by\nbringing question-askers up to the virtual stage\n.\n3. Whole-Self Approaches to Work\nCompanies that attempt to shoehorn individuals into a loosely defined company culture will continue to lose out to\nwhole-self approaches to team building\nand collaboration. The more your managers identify individual strengths, communication styles, and needs, the easier it will be to build community and improve collaboration.\nThis level of attention can and should be a major part of employee onboarding. In fact, strong onboarding programs can boost productivity and impact whether an employee feels prepared in their role. It will also ensure 50% greater retention, according to\nHarvard Business Review\n.\nBuilding a virtual community with your employees also requires a work-friendly approach to openness and vulnerability. For example, using a service like\nBucketlist\ncan help employees win points toward their “bucket list,” a shared wishlist of experiences that allows managers to get to know their people better—and helps motivate employees to bring their best self to work.\n‍\nTech tip:\nEstablish a strong foundation for your new hires and get them off to a fast start by hosting your\nonboarding sessions\non Welcome. Measure engagement, boost connection, and introduce them to culture all in a single, easy-to-use virtual space.\nStrong onboarding programs improve employee retention by as much as 50%. -\nHarvard Business Review\n.\n4. Transparency\nIn the era of employee feedback, employees can feel like they’re offering suggestions or voicing real needs but not really being heard. Companies that offer transparency by holding\nreal-time polls\n, providing accountability timelines, and sharing meaningful progress on initiatives will win the trust of their team.\nThe same goes for transparency around roles and responsibilities. Hybrid work has muddied the waters when it comes to who’s doing what and when. In fact, as many as 22% of employees\nadmitted\nthat “uncertainty over priorities” regularly caused missed deadlines, while 23% of employees attributed struggling with deadlines to “unclear processes.”\nEliminate confusion and boost productivity by clearly documenting team member responsibilities and deadlines. With more transparent processes in place, it will also be easier to pare down on “work about work,” or the meetings and emails that duplicate work rather than help your team get things done.\n‍\nTech tip:\nCapture employee feedback in the moment with Welcome’s\nreal-time polling feature\n. Not only will you get a sense of how your people feel right away, but you can also broadcast the results in real time to boost transparency and accountability.\n5. Recognition\nEmployee recognition goes beyond compensation and benefits packages—although data from the Great Reshuffle shows that\nsalary still matters\na great deal to workers who are considering jumping ship.\nWhen it comes down to it, recognition is directly linked to employee engagement.\nGallup\nfound that employees who receive daily feedback from their team leader are three times more likely to be engaged in their work than employees who only receive feedback during a yearly review—or even less frequently.\nBy building a culture of recognition into your daily check-ins or all-hands meetings, you won’t just be keeping your employees happy. You’ll be saving money, too. One\nFast Company analysis\nfound that spending the amount of an average employee’s salary on a recognition program can cut your turnover rate in half—saving you hundreds of thousands of dollars in training and salary costs.\n‍\nTech tip:\nRecognize and spotlight employee milestones with Welcome’s\nshout-out feature\n. We make it easy to tip your hat to an employee of the month on stage, celebrate birthdays or work-a-versaries, and more.\nSpending the amount of an average employee’s salary on a recognition program cuts your turnover rate in half—saving you hundreds of thousands of dollars in training and salary costs. -\nFast Company analysis\n6. Career Training and Development\nIn 2020, an “opportunity to learn and grow” shot to the top of LinkedIn’s\nlist\nof company culture drivers. For some employees, career training was even more important than feelings of belonging or strong collaborations.\nData from the Great Reshuffle bears this out, too. As many as 65% of employees\nsurveyed\nlast year said that their employer didn’t offer enough opportunities to grow at the company—and that this factor contributed to their desire to quit.\nCompanies that find creative ways to invest in the growth and development of their employees will retain top talent and attract better hires. From\nteam building exercises\nthat improve collaboration skills to training courses that give your employees an edge in their positions, career development should be at the top of your list.\n7. Better Managers\nDon’t forget that managers need career support, too. Many team leaders worked their way to the top of the ladder by excelling at their jobs—not necessarily by excelling in people management.\nEven more significant? A single manager or team leader can account for 70% of the variance in team engagement, according to\nGallup\n. If your employee engagement is inconsistent, or a team’s engagement levels are flagging, providing more support to the team leader is a worthwhile investment.\nLeadership may need to encourage managers to take a bigger role in the learning and development of their own team members. Research published in the\nHarvard Business Review\ndemonstrated that involving managers in growth and development training made a big difference, both in the quality of the manager and in the quality of employee training.\nAfter all, in the Employee Era, career growth is for every single person on your team—no matter where they are in your hierarchy.\n‍\nTech tip:\nWelcome makes it easy to host career-boosting\nwebinars\nand training sessions. Keep your people engaged in their growth and development from the very first minute with featured speakers, recorded content, and real-time polls that measure employee understanding.\nFinal Thoughts\nWe already know why employees value the flexibility they found during remote work—and that most employers are planning for a hybrid workforce moving forward. But other drivers behind a great employee experience are just as beneficial for employers, too. An employee event platform like Welcome gives you all the tools you need to launch stronger employee recognition programs, improve transparency, and make your employee experience more equitable.

When employees are choosing whether to stay or go, they evaluate how it feels to work at your company—even more than wages and benefits.\nThankfully, managers can learn employee coaching tips to become better managers themselves. This will interrupt the “doom loop” that leads to a cycle of voluntary turnover and underinvestment in soft skills, says Tyler Muse, CEO of\nLingo Live\n.\n“Bad managers lead to employees leaving, which drops revenue, hurts your cash, and prevents you from being able to invest in improving those managers,” Muse explained.\nOne solution? Skills-based coaching, which provides a safe space for managers to integrate new behaviors, try them out in real time, and stay accountable to their coaches.\nAfter all, the more your managers work on improving communication skills or the art of having a difficult conversation, the easier it will be to meet your business goals and\nimprove your company culture\n.\n5 Best Practices for Employee Coaching\nIn our recent event,\nBreaking the Doom Loop with Skills-Based Coaching\n, Muse joined\nWelcome\nCEO Roberto Ortiz to discuss how to train stronger, more supportive managers.\nHere are 5 event take-aways that can help your managers grow in their roles:\nKeep managers accountable with skills-based coaching, especially in key areas like communication and\npeople skills\n.\nUse helpful frameworks, like “Behavior, Impact, and Question,” to guide feedback sessions or difficult conversations.\nRe-structure your one-on-one times with direct reports to provide them with additional, targeted support.\nHelp employees grow\ninto their careers, even if they’re only with the company for a short time.\nBe open and vulnerable to feedback on your own management skills.\n‍\nWatch the full event\nhere\nfor more insights about the link between better managers and employee retention.\nGive Managers the Right Skills for Success\nMost managers come to the role with little prior management experience. That means they’ll have to learn, practice, and apply new skills with their direct reports as they manage their team.\nAccording to Muse, the majority of skills most managers need additional coaching for fall into five categories:\ncommunication\n, emotional intelligence, people skills, performance, and critical thinking skills.\nThese skills encompass everything from actively listening to your team to having difficult conversations and ensuring accountability.\nAs managers begin to practice skills in these areas, they ultimately become more supportive of their direct reports. This is most important when your organization is growing quickly, pointed out Ortiz.\n“Sometimes, you're running so fast in a high-growth company that you take those things for granted,” Ortiz said. “But employees are craving that level of feedback, they're craving that level of clarity, and they're craving even the growth that comes from performance.”\nMuse agreed. “It’s really hard work,” he said. “You spend your whole life trying to get better at these things, and that’s okay.”\nChange How Your Managers Deliver Feedback\nOne of the most important roles of a good manager is to provide feedback to their employees. To make the biggest impact, suggested Muse, begin by using a questioning framework, rather than a judgmental one.\nThrough a partnership with\nLifelabs Learning\n, the coaching experts at Lingo Live developed a framework for feedback sessions called “Behavior, Impact, Question,” or BIQ.\nFor example, a manager might point out that their employee cut off another person in a meeting, making it difficult for that person to contribute to the discussion. Then, they would ask their report a question about that behavior.\n“It's my job as your manager to give you feedback,” Muse explained. “But, at the same time, I'm open to hearing your reaction and your thoughts on this. I think questions are really important, so that you make the other person feel free to share how they feel.”\nOver the years, Muse has also changed how he coaches employees in his one-on-one meetings. “I have all my direct reports send me an update each week. When we have our weekly one-on-ones, I don't have to spend any time getting status updates from you. I can just dive into figuring out what you need,” said Muse.\nRe-thinking the Employer-Employee Relationship\nTaking a collaborative approach to priority-setting and day-to-day work has ultimately changed how Muse views the employer-employee relationship.\nEmployees no longer stay with companies for decades. By acknowledging this reality, employers can set workers up for success by\nsupporting their growth\n—even if that leads to a job with a different company.\n“Over half of the exiting employees who left a company say that in the three months before they left, neither their manager nor any other leaders spoke to them about their job satisfaction or their future with the organization,” said Muse.\n“You've got to acknowledge it's a two-way street. It is not just this person's job to do the job description you've laid out. It's your job to set them up for a really successful career in the time that they're with you,” he added.\nSelf-Reflective Managers Will Change Your Company Culture\nIf there’s one thing managers can do to improve on their management skills, says Muse, it’s to become more self-reflective and open to feedback from their team.\nThat’s often an uncomfortable position for managers to put themselves in!\n“Vulnerability is sending out a survey to your people and saying, ‘Hey, there are these leadership skills that I think are a good embodiment of what a leader is. Can you share with me things that you think I do well, and things that I could do a better job at?’” said Muse.\nWhile it might not be easy to hear how you can improve, understanding what you’re doing well and how you can do better is ultimately empowering. When managers support their teams successfully, they have a direct impact on retention—and the future growth of your company.\nFinal Thoughts\nRetaining employees is about more than offering fun perks and competitive wages. It takes a thoughtful approach to designing the entire lifecycle of your employees—and managers who are willing to help you every step of the way.\nWelcome\nis employee event software designed to support your employee lifecycle.\nOnboard and engage new hires\n, gather the company for an\nall-hands meeting\n, or support employee coaching needs, all in one, highly energizing platform.\nStart designing a better company culture for your team today.

{"id":"a527bbb1-8a15-452a-927b-7577e449541d","url":"https://www.experiencewelcome.com/blog/office-culture-hybrid-work","title":"How to Build Office Culture in the Era of Hybrid Work | Welcome Blog","text":"Sign up for The Drip\nJoin 5000+ marketers that receive The Drip newsletter covering the most relevant topics in B2B marketing.\nFirst name\nJob Title\nEmail\n*\nI agree to receive product updates and marketing emails from Welcome (recommended)\nFeatures\nPricing\nResources\nBlog\nMarketing Guides\nSupport\nEvents\nAbout\nLogin\nLogin\nDemo\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/office-culture-hybrid-work\nWe typically think of the office as a place where chance meetings, face-to-face collaboration, and other interactions drive culture and innovation.\nBut when researchers\nstudied\ncommunication patterns in open-plan offices, they discovered that “face-to-face communication dropped by 70%, replaced by electronic communication.”\nMid-pandemic, the need for physical office space continues to shrink. And the way we make use of offices is evolving. Instead of water cooler chats, we have Slack channels. Instead of break rooms, we break out into groups on Zoom calls.\nSince hybrid work is here to stay, it’s important for execs and HR reps to meet employees where they are right now and build experiences that support their needs.\nOffice culture might look different now that we’re working remotely, but you can still create a positive work environment—and boost employee engagement at the same time.\nWhat is Office Culture?\nAccording to\nGartner\n, organizational culture “is the set of behavioral norms and unwritten rules that shape how employees interact and get work done.” What’s more, a clearly defined culture is “critical to creating the best experience for employees.”\nIn order to\nbuild an equitable office culture\n, it’s crucial that leaders transform any “unwritten rules” guiding employee behavior into clearly documented expectations and values. Ensure that everyone on your team is working and interacting in a way that supports those values—even if all the interactions take place online.\nAfter all, when you work in a physical office space, managers and executives model the behaviors they wish to see. They offer feedback on employee behavior during performance reviews and reward employees who exhibit the values of the company with promotions, raises, or significant projects.\nIn hybrid work, however, these interactions are now digital. A written record of employee interactions exists across multiple communication platforms, making it easier to track who contributes positively to your office culture.\nUltimately, a clearly defined organizational culture gives your employees a purpose. And when employers successfully link\npurpose-driven work\nto company values, they are more likely to boost productivity and increase employee retention.\nHow to Build Your Hybrid Office Culture\nBuilding office culture for your remote workplace takes time and intention. But carving out the time to define your organizational culture is worth it.\nHere are five best practices for building your office culture—even if your office is a hybrid or digital one.\n1. Revisit your company values\nPart of the ongoing resistance to remote and hybrid work comes from a spooked C-Suite. These leaders fear that decentralizing the physical office space will lead to a sense of disconnection, a lack of innovation, and even less productivity.\nInstead, the opposite turns out to be true! According to a survey conducted by\nGartner\n, 64% of hybrid employees and 66% of remote employees say their organization’s culture has a positive impact on their job. That’s about a 12% increase over employees who work primarily in the office.\nSo something about remote work culture seems to be translating—even if company leadership isn’t exactly sold on remote or hybrid work in the long term. But why are remote and hybrid employees feeling more connected to digital workplace cultures than their in-person peers?\nOne possibility may be that the sudden shift to remote work forced employers to clarify what their organizational culture actually\nis\n. In order to have a strong hybrid office culture, you first need to document what your company values look like in the new hybrid environment.\nBut you can’t just stop at documentation. Leaders at every level need to buy into those values and what enacting them looks like, so they can model behavior and continue to shape it in the digital workplace.\nAt\nWelcome\n, for example, we value mutual support and team trust. Our go-to motto is, “I Got You.” You can see the value enacted across the organization, whether in our Slack channels, at all-hands meetings, or in cross-team demos and office hours. We even made our values a hashtag and created emoji icons for Slack to embody these values as a group!\nBut the concept doesn’t just guide interactions between our team members. Because it’s a company-wide value, it applies to every element of our customer experience, too. Whether customers need extra production support or a guide to using the software for internal events, we have plans in place to support them every step of the way.\n2. Facilitate Personal Connections Across Your Company\nAccording to\nMcKinsey\n, employees rank feeling valued by their managers and the company, as well as having trusting and caring team members more highly than employers do. This mis-match is actually contributing to the record-high turnover we’re seeing during\n“The Great Resignation.”\nWhen your employees aren’t connected by a physical space, it takes more time and intention to facilitate connection. That means it’s up to leaders to foster connections between team members across departments by breaking down silos. The more you’re able to encourage collaboration and connection, the more engaged your employees will be.\nIdeas for creating an engaging office culture:\nSpecific Slack channels for inter-departmental collaboration\nRotating departmental office hours open to the entire company\nStrong onboarding processes that help new hires develop relationships with team members in different departments\nVirtual team-building with social activities, clubs, or networking events\nAnd don’t just stop at departmental collaboration. It’s crucial for leaders to connect with their employees during all-hands meetings, too. By gathering the entire company to discuss goals and milestones during an\nall-hands event\n, your C-Suite and management team connect with employees around the values and mission that actually drive company culture.\nWhether you report on a company milestone or pull team members live on stage for a Q&A, your all-hands discussion can directly support your culture and business goals. The right\nvirtual event software\ncan help you make these moments more interactive, too. Boost employee engagement and receive meaningful feedback with polling, or track employee sentiment scores to see how your efforts to build office culture stack up over time.\n‍\n3. Make a Greater Effort to Recognize Employees\nBuilding a hybrid office culture takes more than regular employee recognition. When employees understand how their role helps the company—or helps make a difference—they feel their role has a meaningful purpose and impact.\nIn an episode of the\nForrester podcast\n, principal analyst David Johnson recommended checking in more often with employees to make sure they feel seen and heard.\n“Our guidance to clients [during the pandemic] has been to really ramp up the recognition, ramp up the manager one-on-ones, and make sure people feel like they’re contributing in meaningful ways,” Johnson said.\nIn remote workplaces, this requires multiple touch points—from your\nall-hands meeting\nto one-on-one check-ins. This will help prevent feelings of burnout, frustration, or resentment, which can build up when employees feel their contributions are going unnoticed in the digital realm.\nUltimately, providing employees with a sense of purpose contributes to increased connection and work satisfaction, which will keep your team happy, fulfilled, and motivated.\n4. Help Employees Find Their Footing\nA recent study from\nQualtrics\n, an experience management software company, found that more than 50% of leaders are seeking new job opportunities at this point in the pandemic.\nWith\n“The Great Resignation”\nin full swing, retaining top talent means you’ll need to find ways to re-assess individual roles. Whether you conduct employee surveys or fold observations into your annual performance reviews, here are a few questions to consider:\nAre your employees happy, productive, and empowered in their current positions? If not, how can you help them transition into a role that’s a better fit for their particular skills?\nWould splitting one position into multiple roles make everyone in that department more successful?\nWhich employees need additional training to fit better in their current roles? Or success coaching to navigate an upcoming promotion?\nWhen employees feel their company is investing in their training and growth, they’re more likely to stick around. The same\nQualtrix\nstudy found that 60% of employees were not offered sufficient career training or professional development opportunities in the past year. That’s a dealbreaker for as many as 23% of employees, who cite growth opportunities as a reason for leaving their current positions.\nBy supporting your employees where they are, investing in professional development, and providing opportunities for skill building, you’ll build employee engagement—and a culture of growth.\n‍\n5. Encourage Feedback—And Act On It\nLet’s face it: you can’t shift your office culture without employee input. And you can’t determine how that culture is changing without identifying and tracking key metrics.\nWhether you conduct employee polls and surveys during an all-hands meeting or track employee sentiment scores over time, be transparent about the data you’re collecting and how it will be used.\nIf you know you want to\nshift your employee sentiment scores\n, for example, make a plan for how you’ll act on the results and stay accountable to your team. If you’ve hit a wall and can’t take action yet, be transparent about that, too.\nWhen employees see that you’re not only collecting feedback but translating it into actionable steps, they understand that their input matters. Not only does this increase their sense of ownership and agency within the company, it makes them feel seen, heard, and valued—crucial sentiments for increasing engagement.\nFinal Thoughts\nOffice culture is no longer contained by the four walls of a physical workplace. Instead, it’s built in the remote and hybrid spaces where work happens. How leaders in the C-Suite and HR executives support your company culture in these spaces will make all the difference to your employee experience.\nWith the right tools, you can measure how your culture is changing—and how employees feel about it, too. By documenting your values and enacting them across all your communication platforms, you can build a positive culture where employees feel valued, connected, and supported in their work.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/office-culture-hybrid-work\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

In fact, leading with empathy often drives results and performance.\nDaily or weekly check-ins on stress and happiness give your team immediate insights on bandwidth.\nAuthenticity can be a catalyst for empathy. Bringing the whole self to work increases trust and helps you build stronger connections with your team.\nTrust is built through high levels of interaction, flexibility, and disclosure. With those elements in place, your team can move mountains.\nLike other frameworks, empathetic leadership strategies have to change as you scale.\nWatch the full event\nhere\nfor more ideas and leadership best practices.\nWhy an Empathetic Workplace Culture Comes from the Top\nWhen we focus too much on performance indicators and not enough on the human side of work, our employees—and our company’s employee experience—suffers.\nIn fact, data\nsuggests\nthat workers were more productive than ever during the switch to remote and hybrid work. But, for many employees, this came at the expense of weaker work-life boundaries,\nincreased stress\n, and worsening anxiety.\nIt’s up to leaders across the board to get to know their employees, including their needs, communication styles, and work loads. When this work comes from the top, it not only improves employee experience—it makes everyone on your team happier and\nmore productive\n.\nFor Smith, this looks like making time and space in leadership meetings to discuss energy levels, as well as stress levels inside and outside of work. Leaders rank their energy and stress levels from 1 to 10, so the rest of the team can adjust as needed.\nWhen things are going well, “we are all happier to hear those stories, because we want to share the joy,” said Smith. And when a team member needs more support, “it gives us an opportunity to be empathetic as an entire leadership team.”\nPerhaps most importantly, this tactic has spread to other teams within Smith’s organization.\n“My leaders are doing that for their teams, and then their managers are doing that for their teams, and we're becoming a more empathetic organization,” Smith added.\nLomax agreed. He puts time on his calendar to check in on employees and uses a wide variety of communication methods, from an email to an hour-long sit-down.\n“Often I've found that's more important than the work because the work is going to have to get done,” said Lomax.\n“We're going to all continue to drive the profits, the process, the operations. Otherwise, none of us will be in our roles,” he continued. “But I think what cements the connection, the bond, the loyalty, the inspiration, is taking that time and making it a part of your process to check on your people and to follow through.”\nThe Link Between Employee Experience & ROI\nIf you want to change your workplace culture, getting buy-in from leadership is the first step. Surprisingly, it’s not difficult to demonstrate how performance indicators and\nempathetic leadership\ngo hand-in-hand.\n“We spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to make more money, how to make the process work,” observed Smith. “We need to spend an equal amount of time trying to figure out how to keep our people happy and productive. And to make sure that\nthey\nare right. Because if they're right, the business will be right.”\nWhether you focus on happiness training, like Smith does with her team, or leading with a\n“whole self” approach\nto work, building authentic relationships through trust will result in more empowered employees.\n“Authenticity can be a catalyst for empathy,” suggested Smith. “Bringing my whole self to work has paid more dividends for me than anything else.”\nAnd when\nemployees are empowered\nto work in ways that are authentic to who they are, they’ll be happier, productive, and more engaged than ever.\nFinal Thoughts\nBuild stronger, more authentic connections with your team using Welcome’s\nemployee event platform\n.

Confusing cross-talk in meetings. As employees slowly return to the office, hybrid workplaces still haven’t figured out how to fully engage team members who are working remotely.\nAccording to\nThe New York Times\n, 40% of Manhattan offices are now hybrid workplaces—but most are struggling. “Hybrid is most definitely tougher than completely in person or completely remote,” Brett Hautop, LinkedIn’s head of workplace, told the\nTimes\n. “It takes a lot more forethought, and none of us, or anybody else at any company, has figured out exactly how it’s going to work.”\nAs employers grapple with technology and the ambiguity of hybrid work policies, new challenges continue to affect employee belonging. Smoothing out the rough edges will take more than policy shifts. It’ll take intentional decisions to improve both people and technology.\nA 2020 survey by\nFuture Forum\nfound that companies investing in technology for digital work have employees who are two times more likely to feel a greater sense of belonging. You’ll certainly see a return on investment (ROI) by investing in digital infrastructure that improves employee experiences.\nBut there are practical ways to upgrade hybrid work, too. When all-hands meetings, onboarding sessions, and work-sponsored social events create connection instead of frustration, employees feel more engaged, productive, and supported.\nHere’s everything you need to know about holding the types of hybrid events that will bring your team closer together—even if you’re working apart.\nImproving Your All-Hands Meeting\nAll-hands meetings\nare the centerpiece of the remote-friendly workplace. They’re important opportunities to gather your team, clarify your company goals, and open up a two-way conversation between leadership and employees.\nBut they take lots of planning to execute well in a remote or hybrid work setting. You’ll have to account for employees who work across time zones, compete with Zoom fatigue, and manage event production to boot.\nThat’s no easy feat. According to a study from\nAtlassian\n, the brainpower behind Jira and Trello project management tools, most employees don’t feel connected during their company meetings at all. Instead, they’re distracted, finishing other work, taking naps—or not even present.\nWith interactive\nhybrid event software\n, you can stop worrying about production and focus on delivering exciting, engaging content that drives away distraction. Here are a few ideas we use at Welcome to build connections across teams during our all-hands meetings:\nMajor milestone celebrations\nLive Q&A\nBreak-out watch rooms for small groups or teams\nFlash mobs, trivia, and other fun activities that foster belonging\nEven though your hybrid all-hands meeting is designed for employees to attend in real time, it’s just as important to consider your asynchronous team members. Recording, distributing, and following up on the content in your all-hands helps employees connect when they’re able—and keep them in the loop.\nThe all-hands meeting is an important opportunity to improve employee belonging. By building in special moments of company-wide connection, you’ll keep your team engaged, inspired, and focused.\nOnboarding Hybrid Employees\nWith more employees than ever leaving their jobs, your company will likely be tasked with onboarding new hires remotely. It’s crucial to get this process right. A great onboarding experience can make or break employee retention—and productivity.\nAccording to\nBamboo HR\n, as many as 68% of employees will leave a new job in the first six months. The reasons behind this statistic vary. New hires can be overwhelmed or lost in a big company where team dynamics already feel settled. But they might also sense a disconnect between the job they applied for and their day-to-day work experience.\nUsing your hybrid event platform to onboard new employees can immediately foster a sense of belonging. With the right tools, you can:\nIntroduce new employees in a stage-like setting during company meetings\nPair new hires up with a senior colleague in break-out rooms for one-on-one attention\nEncourage existing employees to reach out, check in, and react to your new hires in the chat and in other communication tools, like Slack or Asana\nBut onboarding doesn’t stop at introductory meetings. To keep your new hires engaged over time, managers and team leaders should check in regularly over the first three to six months. When new employees feel engaged by leadership, they understand that they belong—and that there’s a place for them to grow into their role at the company.\nDesigning thoughtful onboarding programs will benefit your entire organization, too. They encourage existing employees to connect, share company culture, and help new team members feel welcome. By encouraging and rewarding\nsocial support\nwithin your digital office, your company improves employee belonging for everyone. It’s a win-win.\nSupporting Teams to Foster Employee Belonging\nWorkers leave roles for all sorts of reasons. But two of the\nmost frequently cited scenarios\nare lack of support and lack of opportunities to grow.\nIn the middle of a talent war, you can’t afford for your best people to leave because of a lack of investment in their careers. In fact, workers are looking for on-the-job coaching and education. One study from LinkedIn found that as many as\n94% of employees\nwould remain in their position if their company invested in additional training.\nLike other internal events, people success coaching, leadership training, and professional development can all be delivered effectively through hybrid event software. We improve engagement and keep teams energized by:\nUsing interactive, personalized content to keep teams interested\nMoving seamlessly between small group training sessions and more intimate conversations\nGiving employees more opportunities to provide real-time feedback using polls\nTracking sentiment scores and identifying where coaches can improve content or make 1-on-1 interventions\nBut investing in your team members isn’t just about improving performance or developing great leaders. It directly reinforces the\ncore principles of employee belonging\n: recognition and support. And that’s a win-win for your company culture.\nCreating Community with Hybrid Activities\nWe love a good professional development day as much as the next person. But there’s more to improving employee belonging at your company than work events. (We bet you already knew that, though.)\nAs with all social connections, employees need opportunities to connect with their colleagues as people. When employees feel connected to their team members, they’re happier, more productive, and more likely to stick around. And in hybrid workplaces, those opportunities need to be intentionally designed and carefully planned.\nBecause of the challenges of hybrid work, however, some employees are beginning to feel\nless\nconnected to their colleagues and their company. According to a 2020 survey conducted by\nGensler\n, 75% of employees reported missing their colleagues and face-to-face connections. This led to a sense of frustration about the difficulties of collaboration and staying up-to-date with important work developments.\nYou don’t necessarily need to work in the same office to feel connected to your co-workers—but you do need a chance to spend time with them outside of meetings and Slack chat rooms. (We would also argue those meetings and chat rooms should be designed for connection, too.)\nAt Welcome, we plan for connection in lots of different ways:\nBy encouraging team members to create virtual watch rooms for their closest work pals\nBy fostering social groups and clubs within the virtual office\nBy intentionally building in “social” time to our all-hands meetings or off-site gatherings\nAfter all, there are no water coolers or shared kitchens in the hybrid workplace. Or, if there are, not all employees will have access to them at the same time. That means it’s up to leaders to build in time for connection as a way to improve belonging.\nFinal Thoughts\nWhether you’re scheduling your next all-hands meeting or onboarding a new hire, hybrid events give you the power to improve belonging at work. With the right hybrid event platform, you can seamlessly build in moments for meaningful connections and engage directly with your team.\nThoughtfully designed internal events also eliminate barriers between team members and company leadership, so you always know how you’re doing—and where you can improve. By supporting the day-to-day needs of your team with better communication, management, and training, you’ll set your entire company up for success.\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/improve-employee-belonging-with-better-hybrid-events\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

Conferences often have complex agendas that can span multiple days and include multiple sessions like keynotes, breakouts, networking, and more. All the info is structured in a way that helps attendees navigate the event.\nFor the last year and a half, large events have looked a little different. As the world moved online, so did conferences. But as the venue shifted to virtual, the event basics stayed the same, including the need to structure your event.\nThat's where our newest feature, Agenda, comes in. Now your virtual events can clearly outline all the information needed to keep attendees in the know.\nWelcome to Agenda\nWe think holding a large event without an agenda is like ordering from a restaurant without a menu. Not keeping your attendees informed can leave them feeling lost and asking questions. Agenda helps with that by showing what topics will be discussed, where, and when.\nAgendas can be easily viewed by attendees during registration and be viewed privately within the live event experience. The schedule of events can be displayed at all times no matter what room or what track your attendees are in–without ever being removed from the experience.\nLearn insights through data\nThe benefit Agenda provides the attendee experience is clear. But, it's also extremely helpful to the event marketer in another way. Have you ever wondered which session or speaker was the most popular? Or which session got the most interaction and engagement? Agenda data is segmented per session and includes all the activities that are taking place amongst the audience. Now, you can review the session data and paint a picture of how your attendees interact with the event and speakers. The data may even give you a better idea of how you should plan your next event.\nAgendas made easy\nBuilding an agenda can be done in a snap and is created within the Welcome platform–no integrations necessary. We all know that live events can sometimes be unpredictable. Speakers could run overtime or just not show. If you find yourself needing to make changes to the run-of-show for whatever reason, producers can change the agenda during the event.\nCustomization is also included. Your brand, your colors, and your ethos are present throughout the entire virtual experience, and that includes Agenda too. Your brand colors can be used throughout the agenda so it maintains your visual brand identity.\nFeature Details\nAttendees can add the agenda to their calendar by days and by individual agenda items\nBrand colors can be used throughout\nVisual timers show how much time is left in the current session\nAttendees can see agendas of multiple tracks\nAttendees can view agendas during registration and privately within the live event experience\nAgenda stays visible throughout the platform or can be hidden\nAgenda data is segmented per session and includes audience activity like chat, Q&A, and polling results\nAbout Welcome\nFrom agendas to our state-of-the-art production studio, each of Welcome’s features adds up to provide a truly exceptional virtual experience platform. One that not only works seamlessly for an event of any size but delivers meaningful engagement and data-backed results—all while looking stunningly beautiful.

Not only are employees looking for new positions, but their needs have also changed. That means our strategies for building a positive company culture must change, too.\nThese 5 people leaders are in the vanguard of culture change at their own companies. Find out what they’re doing to drive employee engagement—and why it’s working.\n1. Lattice\nThe leader:\nDave Carhart\n, VP of People\nThe lesson:\nEarlier this year, VP of People\nLattice\n, Dave Carhart, spoke movingly about underestimating the challenges hybrid work would pose for the entire company.\n“I was overconfident, both in my own assessment of what the pandemic would bring and I think all of us as a leadership really felt that we knew what hybrid working would be like,” Carhart told\nHR Daily Advisor\n.\n“All of that was wrong…It’s taught me to embrace experimentation, optionality, and emergent strategy much more than I have in the past and also to be really open with employees about uncertainties, unknowns, and the undecideds,” he added.\nWhy it matters:\n‍\nThe realities of hybrid work have changed the priorities of employees. They’re looking for leadership not only to communicate hybrid work plans effectively, but to also offer more flexibility, higher base pay, and better opportunities for growth.\nIn response to these\nGreat Resignation trends\n, it might be time to re-think your “rewards strategies,” suggests Carhart.\n“Changing relationship between pay and location, new comp tools, the rise of the importance of benefits for remote employees, and the need to continue to shape benefits to support an increasingly diverse workforce,” will all drive how companies attract, reward, and engage their talent.\n2. BetterUp\nThe leader:\nAshley Yousafzai\n, Area Vice President, People Insights\n‍\nThe lesson:\n‍\nBetterUp\nis a people coaching platform for organizations and individuals. In addition to overseeing BetterUp’s counseling partnerships, Dr. Ashley Yousafzai is a tireless advocate for gender equity in the workplace.\nFor Yousafzai, equity is part of valuing the employee as a whole person. “Our family leave policy caught my attention early in my job search,” she told her company\nblog\nlast year.\n“I feel supported in living a well-rounded life where financial pressures are not forcing me to choose between doing the work that I love and being a great parent.”\n‍\nWhy it matters:\n‍\nAs employees seek new opportunities, they’re looking for companies that will respect work/life balance and treat them as people with lives, responsibilities, and relationships outside of work.\nAccording to Jim Harter, the Chief Scientist of Workplace Management and Wellbeing at Gallup,\npolicies that promote wellbeing will be the differentiator\nduring the Great Reshuffle.\n“As people start having more choices about where they work, they're going to remember what happened during the pandemic, and they're going to choose organizations based on those that help them improve their overall life,” Harter told the Gallup\npodcast\n.\nThese policies might include strong family leave, flexible hours, and a focus on equitable pay, as Yousafzai suggests above.\n3. Culture Amp\n‍\n‍\nThe leader:\nCraig Forman\n, Lead People Scientist\n‍\nThe lesson:\n‍\nAs an enterprise platform for employee engagement,\nCulture Amp\nempowers its clients to transform their culture with better tools for performance management and employee development.\nNo one knows how to use performance data to create positive culture outcomes better than Craig Forman, Culture Amp’s Lead People Scientist. On the\nCulture Design Show podcast\n, Forman shared one of his top lessons from leading during the pandemic is the importance of emotional intelligence, or  “EQ, EQ, EQ!”\n“I’m able to grow from my failures, I’m able to learn, I’m able to take feedback, because I’m able to, like, get\nme\nout of it, and want the deep desire to grow,” Forman said. “And I think we need more of that with our leaders. It’s not a one and done, it’s not a training, it is a practice.”\nUltimately, your leadership’s ability to be vulnerable, reflective, and listen to your team drives culture change.\nWhy it matters:\n‍\nAt unhealthy companies, there’s often a big disconnect between employees and leadership. This leads to team members feeling overworked and undervalued, and, in the Great Reshuffle, that means they’re more likely to leave.\nIn fact, as many as\n42% of employees\nsurveyed by Gallup said that management and organizational culture were part of the reason they sought opportunities elsewhere. The manager or team leader alone accounts for\n70% of the variance in employee engagement\n.\nEmployee engagement doesn’t begin and end with individual workers.\nHow your managers and top leadership recognize good work and make employees feel valued matters more than any reward you could choose.\n4. 15five\n‍\n‍\nThe leader:\nShane Metcalf\n, Co-Founder & Chief People and Culture Officer\n‍\nThe lesson:\n‍\n15Five\nis a human-centered performance management platform. As its Chief People and Culture Officer, Shane Metcalf strives to create an environment of psychological safety for his team.\nSafety and trust make it easier for employees to communicate with one another—and with their managers. Establishing this sense of safety is even more important during a time like the Great Reshuffle.\n“If you can be in a more continuous conversation with your people, you'll know if they're thinking about leaving, you'll know if you can actually provide them what they really want,”\nMetcalf told the\nRec Tech Media podcast\n.\n‍\nWhy it matters:\n‍\nIf you’re only surveying your team once or twice a year, you’ll miss out on meaningful opportunities to improve employee engagement as you go.\nFor Metcalf, this means establishing “continuous feedback loops, so you can know where the squeaky wheels are.” With regular, personalized feedback from your employees, you’ll be able to address culture issues more quickly.\nWhether you use surveys, one-on-one meetings,\nall-hands meetings\n, or all three, make a plan for how you’ll use feedback. After all, it’s just as important to collect the feedback as it is to make an action plan. Be sure to communicate the action plan directly to your team and hold leadership accountable for reporting their progress toward change.\n5. Asana\n‍\nThe leader:\nAnna Binder\n, Head of People\n‍\nThe lesson:\n‍\nOne of the premier project management software companies,\nAsana\nis also making waves for its company culture. Anna Binder, Head of People, is a big reason why.\nWhen asked to speak about her culture building successes, Binder told the\nCulture Amp podcast\nthat one of Asana’s main values is “rejecting false trade-offs.”\nThis is especially important for fast-growing companies that may wish to emphasize opportunities for career growth, says Binder.\n“Sometimes the most effective and fastest way to grow personally in your career is to get layered, is to have somebody to come in and hire a manager or another layer above you,” she said.\nThis counter-intuitive move helps employees grow more quickly, giving them a mentor with more experience to learn from in a hands-on way.\n‍\nWhy it matters:\n‍\nThe Great Reshuffle is being fueled by employees who are\nlooking for opportunities to grow\n. And if they can’t find those opportunities in their current roles, they’re looking elsewhere.\nYou may wish to hire additional management and leadership roles to support your current employees, as Binder suggests. Investing in skill-building, coaching, and\nbetter onboarding programs\ncan also transform your employee experience and help you navigate the Great Reshuffle.\nFinal Thoughts\nAs\nemployee experience\nbecomes the primary differentiator in tech, these lessons from top people leaders point the way toward a better company culture. From adjusting your compensation and benefits packages to developing more supportive work policies, there are tactical things you can do to attract and retain talent.

They’ve changed how we address those issues, too.\nFor example, are your entry-level employees given the same amount of remote flexibility as employees with more experience or power? Or, if you’ve established core hours when employees work in-person, do those hours conflict with responsibilities like school pick-up that might create scheduling conflicts for parents?\nFrom meeting structures to core in-person hours, your remote work policies have a big impact on whether your workplace enables equal opportunities for advancement and success. No matter how you’ve re-imagined your remote work culture over the past year, right now is the perfect time to take steps to ensure that it’s designed to benefit everyone equally.\nHow Remote Work Culture Affects Equity in the Workplace\nAccording to research from Global Workplace Analytics, as many as\n50% of employees\nwho worked remotely in 2020 said they would consider leaving a position if they were forced to return full-time to the office.\nAnd it’s no wonder. A year and a half into remote work, most employees continue to enjoy greater work-day flexibility and shorter commutes. For employees of color, who regularly experience microaggressions in the office, remote-friendly policies offer additional mental health and productivity benefits.\nRemote-friendly work has especially supported the needs of Black employees in industries like science and technology. Compared to their white peers, Black knowledge workers are 64% more likely to feel satisfied with their ability to\nmanage work stress\nthanks to remote work policies.\nBut remote work hasn’t been kind to everyone. In particular, women have faced an incredible burden. Women are often expected to juggle work responsibilities with domestic labor, including childcare, cooking, and cleaning.\nWith the collapse of the home-office divide, remote work has negatively impacted their ability to participate in the workforce. In fact, more than\n2.3 million women have left positions\nsince February 2020 because of a lack of childcare or other support structures during the pandemic.\nWithout a strong plan for creating a more equitable remote work culture, company leaders risk exacerbating the existing inequalities faced by women and people of color—or just recreating them in virtual work environments.\nAnd now is not the time to let workplace issues fester. As\n“The Great Resignation”\nspurs a mass exodus of talent across industries, it’s up to leadership to examine remote work culture and make adjustments that create equitable outcomes.\nHere are 5 ways you can change your remote company culture to drive equity and inclusion, starting today.\n1. Co-create workplace guidelines\nWhen\nMcKinsey\nsurveyed remote employees at the beginning of 2021, they discovered that most workers craved more communication about remote work policies from their leaders. In fact, employees who had received clear communication or guidelines were 5 times more productive than employees who hadn’t been looped in by leadership.\nIn order to eliminate anxiety and increase productivity, organizations owe it to their employees to be transparent about their expectations and policies. And with the right tools, you can foster engagement by co-creating workplace guidelines that work for everyone.\nBy\npolling your teams\nor interviewing individual colleagues about their experiences, you’ll get a better sense of how remote workplace policies affect the motivation, productivity, and happiness of your team.\nFor instance, do your core working or overlap hours give everyone in the company equal access to leadership? Are the same team members jumping at opportunities to take on extra projects? If you have working parents on your team, are their family commitments implicitly or explicitly affecting their chances for promotion and advancement?\nAs you consider the input of your team, ensure you can also demonstrate how employee feedback will shape policies that affect everyone. Prioritizing transparency encourages your team to provide honest, authentic feedback and re-enforces a culture of trust and inclusion.\nAfter all, without healthy workplace communication, employees may not feel they can safely address challenges with their supervisors—and then you’ll be back at square one!\n2. Improve transparency\nTransparency around decision making reinforces culture and builds trust. By making the results of polls, informal interviews, or\nemployee sentiment scores\npublic, leadership can demonstrate their ongoing commitment to tracking and documenting an equitable work culture in real time.\nThe value of transparency extends to many other areas of work, too. According to a\nMcKinsey\nroundtable, two practices of healthy remote-first companies include “knowledge sharing [and] performance transparency.”\nIncreasing information-sharing between leadership and employees or across departments breaks down silos. And clearly documenting roles and responsibilities reduces confusion, creates smoother workflows, and clarifies pathways to career advancement.\nThis is especially important for remote-first or hybrid companies, where employees might be logging on at different times of the day to complete their work. Without equal access to knowledge or records of both formal and informal conversations,employees risk duplicating work or working out of alignment with the most recent company goals.\nTo ensure that everyone on your team has up-to-the-minute information about roles, responsibilities, and company-wide goals, consider keeping records of conversations in Slack and sending recordings of\nall hands meetings\nto employees unable to attend in person. This way, everyone’s on the same page and able to do their best work, no matter when they’re logging on—or where they’re logging on from.\n3. Create opportunities for more purposeful interactions\nMany leaders believe that working at a single location is especially beneficial for networking, innovation, and career advancement. If the office is no longer the place where your employees can meet with team members in other departments or pitch ideas to leadership, then it’s up to leaders to intentionally plan for these kinds of interactions.\nWhether you create key windows for collaboration across time zones or institute weekly work rituals, consider how you will make space in the busy work day to foster moments of connection. At Welcome, for example, we have Product Office Hours where we demo the latest features and enhancements to the platform and take questions from our colleagues. We also have Slack channels devoted to non-work topics, like parenting and pets, as well as a “Coffee Exchange Club” that connects us to a new buddy every other month.\nUltimately, employees who feel\nmore connected\nto the purpose of your organization and its values will not only be more motivated, but also more satisfied at work. By planning for and democratizing the ways your team connects, your remote work culture also becomes both more equitable and supportive.\n4. Democratize your workflows\nWhile many companies are seeing an uptick in productivity and worker satisfaction during remote work, the old ways of working still influence decision making. According to\nForrester\n, as many as 60% of companies that attempt to transition to a hybrid structure will “still design meetings, job roles, and promotion opportunities around face-to-face experiences.”\nThis tendency is largely thanks to\n“distance bias,”\nor the human desire to favor the people and subjects who are closest to us. For example, if one of your employees still comes into the physical office every day, and another only comes in three days per week, how will you ensure that both of these team members have equal access to career advancing projects? Will they be evaluated for raises in the same way?\nYou get the picture. The more you can document your company’s remote work policy and preemptively address these persistent issues with leadership, the more equitable your remote work culture will be.\nPaying special attention to meeting dynamics, spreading work assignments around, and asking for feedback from team members who’ve been quiet can also help you avoid focusing on the “loudest” voices in the room, says Ella F. Washington, an organizational psychologist and DEI expert.\n“In virtual meetings, the loudest voice literally gets picked up by the system first,” Washington told\nSlack\n. “Is that who gets the project? We have to consider how we’re evaluating our normal processes from the lens of the virtual environment, and question how they contribute to inequitable outcomes and experiences.”\nAs with policies around performance evaluation and advancement, your day-to-day processes for virtual workflows should be clearly documented and democratized. Don’t just default to the “loudest” voice in your virtual workspace. Plan to engage your entire team—and spread opportunity equally.\nFocus on outcomes\nAccording to\nGartner\n, fewer than 16% of companies currently use technology to monitor employee engagement or other data points. If you’re planning on implementing changes to your remote work culture to increase equity, then it’s crucial to track meaningful data. Broad categories to consider include:\nEmployee sentiment scores\nProductivity\nMotivation\nConnection and belonging\nYou may also wish to track demographic data on individual assignments, promotions, and overall retention in order to see if your policies are resulting in equal access to opportunities and career advancement.\nWith more data in hand, you can determine whether your remote work policies are moving the needle on equity and inclusion. And remember: even the most well-intentioned policies fall short of equity benchmarks. It takes real leadership to listen to your team and identify measurable ways to continue improving. Your company depends on it.\nFurther Reading\nWhat Employees Are Saying About the Future of Work (\nMcKinsey\n)\nAsking Tough Questions to Create a More Equitable Workplace (\nSlack\n)\nThe Future of Work is Hybrid (\nIdeo\n)\nDon’t Lose the Democratizing Effect of Remote Work (\nHarvard Business Review\n)\nShare this post\nhttps://experiencewelcome.com/post/make-remote-work-culture-equitable\nKeep reading\nMarketing Strategy\nStand Out By Staying In: 5 Ways To Use Brand Marketing Right Now\nRead\nWebinar Tips\nBest Alternatives to On24\nRead\nMarketing Strategy\n4 Common Types of B2B Marketing Team Structures Used In 2023\nRead"}

At Welcome, we’d argue a whole lot. Virtual meeting software can help you build a better employee experience—and ensure a major return on investment.\n‍\nWhy Employees Leave: Everything You Need to Know About ‘The Great Resignation’\n‍\nIn September, a researcher at Vizier published the results of a major employee turnover study in\nHarvard Business Review\n.\nOver the course of Summer 2021, more than 4 million employees voluntarily left their positions. According to the study, the majority of these employees were between 30 and 45.\nIf you’re shocked by this revelation, you’re not alone. Typically, this demographic doesn’t hop between new jobs. That’s a trend more often observed in younger employees, who are still discovering which positions and companies are a good fit for their skills or career ambitions.\nBy contrast, older, more experienced employees have more established careers and out-of-work responsibilities, like aging parents and young children. They’re also more burnt out as another year of the pandemic goes on. Because of their level of experience, however, these employees now have more leverage than ever when deciding to go on the job hunt.\nThe Vizier survey also reveals that tech companies took an especially brutal hit during this time period. In this industry alone, employee resignations increased by 4.5%. Unfortunately, the industry benchmark for employee turnover is already notoriously high. According to a widely cited\nLinkedIn survey\n, turnover in tech averaged about 13.2% in 2018—that’s 2.3% higher than the worldwide average.\nAs the pandemic continues, factors like burnout, heavier workloads, and feelings of isolation are driving great employees away from the tech sector—and driving up the costs of employee turnover.\nNow that experienced employees are more likely to seek out the most flexible, well-paying position, competition in the hiring market is fierce. And employers are left wondering how they’ll foot the bill.\nHow much turnover cost employers\n‍\n‍\n‍\nThe Real Costs of Employee Turnover\n‍\nAccording to\nGallup\n, the real-world costs of the employee turnover rates we’re seeing during “The Great Resignation” will be staggering. Collectively, U.S. businesses might lose as much as $1 trillion to voluntary turnover.\nEven on an individual level, the numbers are alarming. Replacing an experienced employee can cost as much as\n125% to 200% of their annual salary\n, depending on their role. If you’re paying competitive rates, you risk shelling out millions of dollars every single year in turnover costs alone.\nOffice perks or flexible schedules aren’t enough to motivate unhappy employees to stick around, either. Most often, the only thing holding employees back from leaving their positions is access to employer health insurance benefits.\nA new study from insurance platform\nPolicygenius\nfound that as many as 33% of employees would leave their current jobs if they didn’t have to worry about health insurance.\nAs these alarming trends indicate, designing a better employee experience should be top of mind for every company leader right now. And if your employees are only sticking around for health insurance, then you’ve got a big problem on your hands.\nNow that we’re in the middle of an all-out talent war, you simply can’t afford\nnot\nto create a better employee retention strategy. Your bottom line depends on it.\n‍\n4 Ways to Improve Employee Satisfaction and Build a Better Remote Work Culture\nA strong employee retention strategy is rooted in your company culture. When\nemployees are engaged\n, they feel more connected to one another, your company’s leadership, and your mission.\nThey’re also more likely to stick around longer and be more satisfied with their work. Here are 4 strategies you can use today to start improving your employee sentiment scores.\n‍\n1. Keep employees engaged during company-wide meetings\nFrom sales calls to team syncs, your employees have already been on camera all day. Sitting through a company-wide meeting is a surefire way to lose their attention. (Hello, Zoom fatigue.)\nThankfully,\nengagement during a virtual meeting\ndoesn’t always mean turning your cameras on. But it does require that you think of your employees as active participants and not as a passive audience.\nThe more you give your employees content to respond to\n,\nthe more engaged they’ll be. Especially when you can demonstrate that their input has an impact on your company’s policies or business goals.\nFor example, you can ask for feedback on a core company goal by taking a virtual poll or encourage team members to react to presentations by dropping emojis in the chat box. With up-to-the-minute feedback, you’ll know whether employees are satisfied with their roles or the direction of the company—and be able to address their concerns moving forward.\n‍\nPolling on Welcome\nTech tip:\nHolding an internal event, like an\nall-hands meeting\n? Use virtual meeting software to measure and track engagement and\nemployee sentiment scores\n. The more data you have at your disposal, the easier it is to track and measure progress as you build a better employee experience.\n‍\n2. Connect your employees with one another\nAs a leader, you know that giving your employees more flexibility—especially during the pandemic—isn’t just a perk. It’s a requirement. But if the office is no longer the hub of employee connection, you need new ways to foster employee belonging.\nEncourage your employees to DM one another, connect one-on-one over calls, and create group chats about specific projects or workflows. When your team is empowered to\nconnect through technology\n, all the energy you generate during company-wide meetings flows into the rest of the work week.\nBreakout group on Welcome\nIn this new era of hybrid and remote work, it’s especially important to ensure that new employees feel connected to colleagues they may not meet in person. According to\nGlassdoor\n, a great onboarding experience can improve employee retention by as much as 82% and increase productivity by more than 70%.\nCreate an onboarding strategy that encourages current team members to DM their new colleague or set up intro calls across the organization. When you build belonging into your company culture—and your tech stack—you’re creating a better employee experience from the ground up.\n‍\n3. Amp up employee agency\nWhen it comes to the daily grind of virtual meetings and never-ending to-do lists, there’s not always a lot of room for individual agency in the workplace. Identify the moments when you can give your employees more choices for how and when they engage with company leaders and company-wide content.\nFor example, during a company-wide all hands meeting, encourage your employees to gather in small groups or in their DMs to watch and react together on your\nvirtual meeting platform\n. By giving your team more agency around how they connect, they’ll actually want to—and you’ll be able to increase motivation across the board.\n‍\nTech tip:\nWhen hosting a meeting on Welcome, activate your lounge rooms to provide employees with their own special places to gather by team or tribe.\n‍\n4. Connect your employees to your company’s leadership and mission\n‍\nLeading remote or hybrid teams is challenging for everyone, including CEOs. Executives aren’t in the office every day, connecting with their employees or ensuring that the entire team is aligned with their vision.\nBecause of this new reality, it’s more important than ever for leadership to communicate clearly and effectively with their teams, no matter where employees are located. A recent survey conducted by\nIBM Watson Media\ndiscovered that employees not only crave this kind of connection with their leaders, but they also want to better understand the strategic direction of their company.\nAnd technology can help. By using people-centered technology to clearly convey your company values, recognize and reward success, and align on new goals, you’ll help your employees feel more connected to the company itself—and to the leaders who shape decision making at the highest levels.\nFinal Thoughts\nImproving your employee retention strategy in the middle of “The Great Resignation” is more important than ever.  With the staggering cost of high turnover rates, you can’t afford not to invest in your people. Employee retention goes to the heart of your company culture, too. When you design your in-person or virtual workplace for a better employee experience, your employees feel engaged, connected, and motivated. And that’s a winning combination.\nAdditional Resources\n‍\n1. Who Is Driving the Great Resignation?

Since then, we’ve signed up countless customers,\nraised $12M from top investors\n, and built a team of nearly 50 amazing people. While this seems like an overnight success, that couldn’t be further from the truth. Just one month before that line of code was pushed, the company had almost literally gone up in flames. This is the wild story of the birth of Welcome.\nThe journey started nearly six months prior, when we were accepted into the Y Combinator program. At the time, our company was called\nGather Wholesale\n, a marketplace for restaurants to buy ingredients. While the idea had promise, our team was ill-equipped to execute on it. We spent countless hours talking to customers and begging them to try our app. We even woke up at 3AM to visit wholesale food markets in San Francisco, dodging forklifts and speaking with bemused dock workers about mobile apps.\nAn early morning at San Francisco's wholesale produce market\nIn early March, our efforts came to a grinding halt as COVID-19 was deemed a global pandemic. In an instant, all of our customers closed their doors and we had no one to sell to. To make matters worse, this all happened a week before demo day, when we were supposed to pitch our startup to thousands of investors. To top it all off, our Airbnb in San Francisco\ncaught on fire\n, leaving us homeless.\nThe one-two punch of COVID-19 and a four-alarm fire had us reeling. We had every reason to throw in the towel. Counting the various ideas we’d tried out before Gather, we had been at it for four years at that point. Now, it was back to the drawing board. As a team, we agreed to take a break and regroup. After a couple weeks in the Colorado mountains watching the world crumble around us, we came back tougher and agreed to give it one last shot.\nTiger, Roberto, and Jerry putting their heads together\nOne of the most fun times in the startup journey is going from zero to one—building something that doesn’t yet exist. For weeks, we sat around and threw out crazy ideas. Like everyone else in the new quarantined world, we also started attending virtual events. What we saw wasn’t pretty: awkward transitions, accidentally muted mics, and a general lack of energy. Events were supposed to be an experience you look forward to. Yet virtual events seemed anything but. It was then that we realized we had an opportunity: to build a virtual event platform that puts experience first. To give even the most non-technical users the ability to put on an event that looks like it was thrown by the best agency in the world.\nOne of the most fun times in the startup journey is going from zero to one—building something that doesn’t yet exist.\nWith this goal in mind, we got to work. As with previous ideas, we started in Figma with a prototype. One of the benefits of having one of the best designers in the world as CEO is that he can bring ideas to life extremely quickly. Once we had a working prototype, we reached out to hundreds of event producers to get their thoughts. The reaction was unanimous: “when can I have this?”\nLeft: Roberto, fueled by coffee. Right: An early Figma prototype of what the Welcome platform might look like.\nWe were encouraged; none of our previous ideas had this type of response before. But we still weren’t satisfied. We knew that words were one thing, but getting a customer to use and pay for your product was another. At the behest of Tiger, our CTO, we waited until someone paid us before writing a line of code. On the surface, this seems crazy. Who would pay for software that wasn’t built yet? But our litmus test would suss out whether our idea was so far ahead of current products that someone would be willing to take the risk.\nA week later, the impossible happened: Tiger successfully got a customer on board—long before we even had a product. With that, he committed the first of many lines of code for Welcome. And the rest, as they say, is history.\nAbout Welcome\nFrom our interactive polling feature to our state-of-the-art production studio, each of Welcome’s features add up to provide a truly exceptional virtual experience platform.

In fact,\n76% of B2B leaders\nsaid that events are their top tactic for generating quality top-of-funnel leads, according to\nDemand Gen Report\n. But even as the event industry took a massive hit from the pandemic, it didn’t take long for B2B companies of all sizes to grasp the impossible-to-ignore upsides of virtual events. We’ve seen work at every level of the funnel—from getting new leads to closing deals—thanks to their flexibility and scalability.\nTo dive deeper into this topic, we recently invited three Go-to-Market leaders from Brex, Adobe, and Outreach onto the Welcome stage to find out how they've used virtual events to drive revenue, generate new leads, enable strong connections (sometimes even more so than in-person events), and deliver highly meaningful experiences.

That’s what makes them better than in-person events, says\nSam Blond\n, Chief Sales Officer at Brex. “Say someone gets invited to a Thursday night dinner by a company that’s trying to pitch them; would they prefer to go to the dinner or hang out with their family? We’ve seen that people would rather get sent a bottle of wine and join a virtual event that provides valuable content.”\nHe believes that creating personalized, intimate virtual experiences are well worth the effort. “The most memorable events I’ve attended were smaller and highly produced. If you have the ability to throw a small event for a curated group of people, you can get a super high return on your investment.”\nGary Specter\n, Adobe’s VP of Growth of DX Business, agrees that virtual events can offer the best bang for your buck, especially from a marketing and pipeline perspective. “If you’re a sales rep who’s working with 40-50 prospects, you can’t get them all in one place physically. A virtual gathering allows you to have targeted conversations with a solid group of people.”\n“The most memorable events I’ve attended were smaller and highly produced.”— Sam Blond, Chief Sales Officer, Brex\nIdentify when attendees are most engaged—and leverage those moments.\nLike countless other companies, sales engagement platform Outreach was forced to cancel one of its biggest events at the dawn of the pandemic, after months of preparation. But what happened instead was far beyond their imagination. The Go-to-Market team pivoted its sales engagement conference to a virtual summit that resulted in 14,000 registrants and influenced $119 million in pipeline. The key to their success? A\ncomplete overhaul\nof their engagement strategy to focus on pre and post event follow-ups.\nUsing a hand graph to illustrate the “engagement” bell curve,\nScott Barker\n, Outreach’s Head of Strategic Engagement, explained that in contrast to in-person events—where engagement skyrockets during the event—virtual events follow the reverse curve. Most of the engagement takes place before and after the event. With this in mind, Outreach “put the onus on [their] sales team to take a really tailored approach to inviting attendees,” said Scott. “Prospects were 65% more likely to move into the next stage of the sales cycle when sales reps invited them, compared to marketing sending the invites.”\nFollowing the summit, the team filtered all attendees using their lead-scoring model, identified the most qualified leads, then followed up using personalized messages. Through this strategy, Outreach ultimately generated\nsix times\nthe pipeline they would have with in-person events in 2020—via expectation-shattering virtual events. Scott emphasized, “You can throw the best virtual event in the world but it's not going to turn into revenue if your follow-through isn't there.”\nEvent engagement curve (via\nOutreach\n)\n“Prospects were 65% more likely to move into the next stage of the sales cycle when sales reps invited them, compared to marketing sending the invites.” — Scott Barker, Head of Strategic Engagement, Outreach\nDelivering great content through virtual events starts with understanding the audience.\nTo identify topic ideas for their events, Scott explained that Outreach often examines the content they’ve published throughout the year, then teases out the best-performing pieces through their events. “We look internally to see what content our audience is responding to and double-down on that,” he said. All three speakers agreed that to have the most meaningful and relevant conversations with customers, you need to start by getting a solid understanding of your target audience. “You’ve got to share highly focused content that’s applicable and valuable to the folks who are at the event,” noted Sam.\nAbout Welcome\nFrom our interactive polling feature to our state-of-the-art production studio, each of Welcome’s features add up to provide a truly exceptional virtual experience platform.
