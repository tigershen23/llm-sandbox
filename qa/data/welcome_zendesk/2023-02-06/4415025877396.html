<h1>Info Tab Guide</h1>
<p>In your event, you will have access to up to two info tabs. Within those tabs, you can link to an iframe-friendly URL. When your users view these tabs they will still be able to view the stage and have access to the communication panel.</p>

<h2 id="01FTVQ5PR6KYDRE6NRB7M8WKP4">Things to be mindful about</h2>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>The website you are linking to will need "iframing" for it to work. Many large public websites will not have this option enabled so you won't be able to link them. You can use <a href="https://iframetester.com/">https://iframetester.com/</a> to check if your website is compatible. </li>
<li>When setting up your info tabs, please <strong>do not</strong> include HTTPS:// as it's already included in the dashboard. Including it will cause your info tabs to not work.</li>
<li>Welcome Support is <strong>not</strong> able to make changes to sites that need iframing. If the site in question is not compatible with Info Tabs, please reach out to your website developer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
