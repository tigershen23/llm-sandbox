You will probably either be screen sharing a slide based presentation such as Microsoft PowerPoint or something from your desktop to show off to the attendees. The purpose of this article is to walk you through how screen sharing works in Chrome and some best practices for presentation software.</p>

<h1 id="01FZBT491T7FJ707KWHBF0G4FX">How to Screen Share</h1>
<p>To start screen sharing you will need to either be inside the Green Room or in one of our Lounge/Breakout rooms. When in the those rooms you should see a button with this logo and may say "Present".</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5171588903316/Screen_Shot_2022-03-29_at_12.31.36_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2022-03-29_at_12.31.36_PM.png" width="113" height="43"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You should receive a pop up with the different screen share options for Chrome</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5172218836756/chrome_Screen_share_pop_up.png" alt="chrome_Screen_share_pop_up.png"></p>
<h2 id="01FZBT431BP213VQ6GB39Y54RG">Screen Share Options</h2>
<p>You will have 3 options to choose from</p>
<ul>
<li>Entire Screen - This will allow you to select entire desktops. If you have multiple monitors you will be given the option to select either or. You are also given the option at the bottom left to toggle on "share system audio"</li>
<li>Window - Allows you to select an open application window</li>
<li>Chrome Tab - Allows you to select an open tab in Chrome. You are also given the option at the bottom left to toggle on "share audio" for that tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on what you are trying to share the behaviors of each option may vary. </p>
<h1 id="01FZBT3ZKGQE8XPNKER3K8PRV1">Screen Sharing Slide Presentations</h1>
<p>Let's go over two of the most used slide presentation software for Windows PC. Ideally, it is best to have access to two monitors when screen sharing a presentation. One monitor would be used for the presentation and the other monitor to view the green room and chat interaction panel. If you do not have access to a secondary monitor that is ok too we will guide you with some best practices for that.</p>
<p>Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides happen to be the most popular. They both are the same but how you share them can be quite different. You will have further differences if you use only one monitor versus two.</p>
<h2 id="01FZBT4GQRYFA8SRDFH3BDKZ9W">Screen Sharing Microsoft PowerPoint</h2>
<p>This is the most popular slide presentation software used for presentations. Based on if you have one or more monitors will vary the way you setup the presentation. A two monitor setup is the most ideal since it will allow you to see both your slides and the Welcome event in full.</p>
<h3 id="01FZBT3SCR45AA5SCC8XQ5VRTB">1 Monitor</h3>
<p>In this method we will be sharing the application window within Chrome. Sadly, due to how Chrome and PowerPoint interact you may have black bar at the right and left of you screen share on the stage. <a href="#01FZBT9ZD409YC7KGV8Y8D2PDS">Google Slide</a> behaves much better than PowerPoint for 1 monitor screen sharing. The reason for this method is so the speaker can both see the presentation they are giving and the Welcome stage at the same time. It is especially good if the speaker is interested in seeing what sort of engagement is happening in the chat. </p>

<p>First thing you want to do is resize you windows so that you can see both the presentation software and Welcome Event<img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5380510104980/Resizing_Windows_window.gif" alt="Resizing Windows window.gif"></p>
<p>In PowerPoint, click "Slide Show", then click "Set Up Slide Show"</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325837496852/power_point_slide_show_setup_PC.png" alt="power point slide show setup PC.png"></p>
<p>Select "Browsed by an individual (window)" and click OK</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5200513817236/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png"></p>
<p>While still in "Slide Show" tab, click "Play from Start" on the left</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5231693306772/PC_PowerPoint.png" alt="PC PowerPoint.png"></p>
<p>You may need to resize the PowerPoint window to be about 2/3rds of your screen (might take some trial and error here depending on your screen size)</p>
<p>Click "Present" within Welcome (it will be towards the bottom left-hand corner)</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325969990932/speaker_present_button.png" alt="speaker present button.png"></p>
<p>Choose "Application Window" tab &gt; select the PowerPoint window &gt; click "Share"</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360079104192/Screen_Shot_2020-12-09_at_8.40.39_AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-12-09_at_8.40.39_AM.png" width="492" height="420"></p>
<p>From here you may need to resize your two windows (PowerPoint and Welcome) into whatever is comfortable for you. Note that you'll still need to keep the PowerPoint window fairly big as if you try to make it smaller it will resize your presentation within the Welcome stage.</p>
<h3 id="01FZBT5J6PP4GR4E186E3SDX5B">2 Monitors</h3>
<p>This is the easiest method to manage two different windows. On monitor will contain the presentation at full screen and the 2nd monitor will contain the Welcome event window. This will also result in a cleaner presentation for PowerPoint due to using "Your Entire Screen" rather than "Application Window".</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong>Video walkthrough here:</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/69d7f0a2b24f453f9a0e5f3ba363b6a9" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">First thing you will need to do is move your presentation to one monitor and your Welcome Window to the second monitor.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">By default your presentation should go straight to full screen but if it doesn't. Within PowerPoint Click on the "Slide Show" tab, then click on "Set Up Slide Show"</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325837496852/power_point_slide_show_setup_PC.png" alt="power point slide show setup PC.png"></p>
<p>Choose "Presented by a speaker (full screen)"</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5382890279444/chrome_pc_powerpoint_full_screen.png" alt="chrome pc powerpoint full screen.png"></p>
<p>While still in "Slide Show" tab, click "Play from Start" on the left. This should make the presentation cover the whole screen.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5231693306772/PC_PowerPoint.png" alt="PC PowerPoint.png"></p>
<p>In the other monitor, Click "Present" on Welcome (it will be towards the bottom left-hand corner)</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325969990932/speaker_present_button.png" alt="speaker present button.png"></p>
<p>Choose the appropriate screen under "Your Entire Screen" tab. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360078962971/Screen_Shot_2020-12-07_at_3.36.08_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-12-07_at_3.36.08_PM.png" width="541" height="461"></p>
<p>The presentation needs to be the active window for you to change slides. Be sure the presentation is the last thing you clicked on.</p>
<h2 id="01FZBT9M1ZK8J475SR08HGHADJ">Screen Sharing Google Slides</h2>
<p>Screen sharing with Google Slides within Chrome is the easiest way and less problematic way of screen sharing a presentation. Unlike PowerPoint which requires either sharing from desktop or application window you will be sharing from a Chrome tab. This results in a cleaner and easier presentation due to Chrome and Slides being in the same Google ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="01FZBT9ZD409YC7KGV8Y8D2PDS">1 Monitor</h3>
<p>In this method we will be sharing from a Chrome tab. For 1 monitor presentations, this behaves better than if you were to use PowerPoint. You may want to consider uploading your PowerPoint presentation to Google slides and run it this way. The reason for this method is so the speaker can both see the presentation they are giving and the Welcome stage at the same time. It is especially good if the speaker is interested in seeing what sort of engagement is happening in the chat.</p>
<p id="01FZBT9M1Z46BNMXJ2X9YY35HW" class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong>Video walkthrough here:</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/e2faac122119494b8f44e18c6aabc119" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Have your Google Slides presentation loaded up in a separate window from Welcome. Once you have been invited and entered the Green Room, click "Present" button on the lower left-hand corner.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325969990932/speaker_present_button.png" alt="speaker present button.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Choose "Chrome Tab" at the top, then your Google Slides presentation. Click "Share" to complete the process. Please note that you can check the "Share audio" check box in the bottom left if you intend to include audio in your presentation.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5327978211988/chrome_tab_share_power_point.png" alt="chrome tab share power point.png"></p>
<p>Now go to your Google Slides presentation Window. You can either go to "View" tab, then click "Slideshow". Or you can simply press "Slideshow" on the upper right-hand corner. You can then resize/move the application window to your liking while also being able to see the Welcome platform. You can use arrow keys to change slides.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5326174700692/present_button_for_google_slides.png" alt="present button for google slides.png"></p>
<h3 id="01FZBTBA8E9E3WZ8SGRVGSSM9B">2 Monitor</h3>
<p>This is the easiest method to manage two different windows. One monitor will contain the presentation  and the 2nd monitor will contain the Welcome event window. This way you don't have to worry about managing the different windows covering each other up. The biggest difference between 1 monitor and 2 monitor sharing for Google Slides is simply moving the application windows to the different monitors. The rest of the steps is exactly the same.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">First thing you will need to do is move your presentation to one monitor and your Welcome Window to the second monitor.</p>
<p>Once you have been invited and entered the Green Room, click "Present" button on the lower left-hand corner.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325969990932/speaker_present_button.png" alt="speaker present button.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Choose "Chrome Tab" at the top, then your Google Slides presentation. Click "Share" to complete the process. Please note that you can check the "Share audio" check box in the bottom left if you intend to include audio in your presentation.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Now go to your Google Slides presentation Window. You can either go to "View" tab, then click "Slideshow". Or you can simply press "Slideshow" on the upper right-hand corner. You can then resize/move the application window to your liking and you can use arrow keys to change slides.</p>
