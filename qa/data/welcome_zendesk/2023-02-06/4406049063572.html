<h1>Custom Registration Guide</h1>
<p>With custom registration, you are now able to set up custom fields to gather more information about your registrants. Custom registration will allow you to collect specific data based on the required fields you choose to implement. All this data will be available in the attendee tab either before or after the event (in other words, this data does not live in the post-event analytics).</p>
