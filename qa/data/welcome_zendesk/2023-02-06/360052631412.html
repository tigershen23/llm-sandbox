<h1 id="01G3E051Z5E4FPWWHYAY6B7TWK" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Best Practices</h1>
<ul>
<li>Starting a recording takes a few seconds (about 10-15 seconds). It's best to start recording a little bit earlier than the event's start to ensure you capture everything (i.e. don't start the recording just as you push a speaker to the stage). You can always cut extra footage during the editing process.</li>
<li>You can start and stop the recording as many times as you'd like. It will create a new file each time.</li>
<li>You <strong>cannot record </strong>breakout rooms and lounges.</li>
<li>If your event is over three hours, the best practice is to start and stop the recordings during intermissions to create new video files in the system. Extremely long videos (3+ hours) are prone to corruption/error and will not generate an SRT file (captions).</li>
<li>Double-check to make sure that you've hit "stop record" at the end of your event. This is very important. If you forget to do this the recording might become corrupted/unplayable.</li>
<li>If you need to change your event time to enable recordings, please make sure you set the time at least 15 minutes in the future to allow the recording server to spin up.</li>
</ul>
