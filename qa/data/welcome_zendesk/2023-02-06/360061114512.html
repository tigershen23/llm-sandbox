<h1>Pre-Recording Content on Welcome</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">The Welcome platform can be used as a production studio to create pre-recorded content for your event. Leveraging recorded content interspersed throughout your event can allow flexibility and reduce the amount of labor that the producer of the event has to manage.</p>

<ol>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Create your event for your recording session in your Organization Dashboard.
<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">In some cases, you may want to create multiple recording event sessions that span different dates.
<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Please make sure that your event times are set correctly as well otherwise the recording server will not be spun up. If you need to change the event time, please make sure that you allow a fifteen-minute grace period before you begin to allow the server to spin up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If you are going to re-use the same event please ensure the start and end times do not span for multiple days. We advise keeping everything one day at a time and updating the event times for each new day. This will ensure the recording server is up to date and does not time out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Add the speaker(s) you need for your recording session within the speaker tab of your Event Dashboard.</li>
<li>Follow the same speaker onboarding process as you would for an event. We have a Speaker Onboarding guide <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052720251">here</a> in case you need it.
<ul>
<li>If the recording session is going to be with one person or a small group, you may be able to get away with onboarding the speaker the same day as the recording.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Day of the recording, perform your tech checks with the speaker(s). If you are having camera or screen sharing permission issues, please refer to our <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058944832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">Troubleshooting Permission Issues</a> article.</li>

<h2 id="01G25895ZPZ4C5PHAY1052D1KD" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can start and stop the recording as many times as you'd like. It will create a new file each time. </li>
<li>The recording function does have a 10 to 15 seconds delay after you press start. It's better to press record early. You can always cut extra footage during the editing process.</li>
<li>As opposed to live events, recording content allows you to make extra takes. Keep that in mind, and don't always feel forced to do it all in one take.</li>
<li>When doing extra takes, make sure the speaker takes a brief pause between them to allow an easier time in editing. </li>
<li>Use overlays and assets; this allows you to create an edge over just a camera recording. We have a couple of articles on using <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061015032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keynote</a> and <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061462771" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Slides</a> to create overlays. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="01G258CNW623WMJ8M3K6Z128KM" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Editing Your Videos</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If you are going to edit your videos here is a list of things to be mindful about:</p>
<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Audio levels - it's always good to double-check your audio levels to ensure that they are not too quiet or too loud. You don't want audio to go over 0db, this will cause your audio to be too loud and start clipping. <strong>A good rule of thumb is to look for an overall mix level of -10db to -14db</strong>.</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Export settings - If you want to use the edited video on Welcome we have some recommendations
<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">File Type - MP4</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Resolution - 720p to 1080p</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Frame Rate - Use the same rate as the OG file, 60fps</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
