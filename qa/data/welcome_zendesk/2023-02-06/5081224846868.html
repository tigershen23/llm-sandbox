<h1>Screen Sharing on Firefox PC</h1>
<p>Screen sharing from Firefox on a Windows PC is uncommon and less refined than if you were to use Chrome. Due to this we do recommend using Google Chrome instead for better outcomes. You can check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5081165870356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Screen Sharing Guide</a>. You will probably either be screen sharing a slide based presentation such as Microsoft PowerPoint or something from your desktop to show off to the attendees. The purpose of this article is to walk you through how screen sharing works in Firefox and some best practices for presentation software.</p>

<h1 id="01FZBT491T7FJ707KWHBF0G4FX">How to Screen Share</h1>
<p>To start screen sharing you will need to either be inside the Green Room or in one of our Lounge/Breakout rooms. When in the those rooms you should see a button with this logo and may say "Present".</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5171588903316/Screen_Shot_2022-03-29_at_12.31.36_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2022-03-29_at_12.31.36_PM.png" width="113" height="43"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You should receive a pop up under the URL bar with the different screen share options for Firefox</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5354187659156/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png"></p>
<h2 id="01FZBT431BP213VQ6GB39Y54RG">Screen Share Options</h2>
<p>You will have 2 options to choose from</p>
<ul>
<li>Screen - This will allow you to select entire desktops. If you have multiple monitors you will be given the option to select either or. You are also given the option at the bottom left to toggle on "share system audio"</li>
<li>Window - Allows you to select an open application window</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on what you are trying to share the behaviors of each option may vary. </p>
<h1 id="01FZBT3ZKGQE8XPNKER3K8PRV1">Screen Sharing Slide Presentations</h1>
<p>Let's go over two of the most used slide presentation software for Windows PC. Ideally, it is best to have access to two monitors when screen sharing a presentation. One monitor would be used for the presentation and the other monitor to view the green room and chat interaction panel. If you do not have access to a secondary monitor that is ok too we will guide you with some best practices for that.</p>
<p>Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides happen to be the most popular. They both are the same but how you share them can be quite different. You will have further differences if you use only one monitor versus two.</p>
<h2 id="01FZBT4GQRYFA8SRDFH3BDKZ9W">Screen Sharing Microsoft PowerPoint</h2>
<p>This is the most popular slide presentation software used for presentations. Based on if you have one or more monitors will vary the way you setup the presentation. A two monitor setup is the most ideal since it will allow you to see both your slides and the Welcome event in full.</p>
<h3 id="01FZBT3SCR45AA5SCC8XQ5VRTB">1 Monitor</h3>
<p>In this method we will be sharing the application window within Chrome. Sadly, due to how Chrome and PowerPoint interact you may have black bar at the right and left of you screen share on the stage. <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5081165870356#01FZBT9ZD409YC7KGV8Y8D2PDS">Google Slide</a> behaves much better than PowerPoint for 1 monitor screen sharing. The reason for this method is so the speaker can both see the presentation they are giving and the Welcome stage at the same time. It is especially good if the speaker is interested in seeing what sort of engagement is happening in the chat. </p>

<p>First thing you want to do is resize you windows so that you can see both the presentation software and Welcome Event<img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5380510104980/Resizing_Windows_window.gif" alt="Resizing Windows window.gif"></p>
<p>In PowerPoint, click "Slide Show", then click "Set Up Slide Show"</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325837496852/power_point_slide_show_setup_PC.png" alt="power point slide show setup PC.png"></p>
<p>Select "Browsed by an individual (window)" and click OK</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5200513817236/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png"></p>
<p>While still in "Slide Show", choose "Play from Start" on the left</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5231693306772/PC_PowerPoint.png" alt="PC PowerPoint.png"></p>
<p>You may need to resize the PowerPoint window to be about 2/3rds of your screen (might take some trial and error here depending on your screen size)</p>
<p>Click "Present" on Welcome (it will be towards the bottom left-hand corner)</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325969990932/speaker_present_button.png" alt="speaker present button.png"></p>
<p>Choose "Window or screen" drop down and select the PowerPoint window. You should see a preview of the selection.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5354275611668/mceclip1.png" alt="mceclip1.png"></p>
<p>From here, resize your two windows (PowerPoint and Welcome) into whatever is comfortable for you. Note that you'll still need to keep the PowerPoint window fairly big as if you try to make it smaller it will resize your presentation within the Welcome stage.</p>
<h3 id="01FZBT5J6PP4GR4E186E3SDX5B">2 Monitors</h3>
<p>This is the easiest method to manage two different windows. On monitor will contain the presentation at full screen and the 2nd monitor will contain the Welcome event window. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong>Video walkthrough here:</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/3a12e7365f8c452c85193eded39bd5f1" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">First thing you will need to do is move your presentation to one monitor and your Welcome Window to the second monitor.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">By default your presentation should go straight to full screen but if it doesn't. Within PowerPoint Click on the "Slide Show" tab, then click on "Set Up Slide Show"</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325837496852/power_point_slide_show_setup_PC.png" alt="power point slide show setup PC.png"></p>
<p>Choose "Presented by a speaker (full screen)"</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5200506627476/mceclip1.png" alt="mceclip1.png"></p>
<p>While still in "Slide Show" tab, click "Play from Start" on the left. This should make the presentation cover the whole screen.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5231693306772/PC_PowerPoint.png" alt="PC PowerPoint.png"></p>
<p>In the other monitor, Click "Present" on Welcome (it will be towards the bottom left-hand corner)</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325969990932/speaker_present_button.png" alt="speaker present button.png"></p>
<p>Choose the appropriate screen in the drop down under "Window or screen"</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5354441929620/mceclip2.png" alt="mceclip2.png"></p>
<p>The presentation needs to be the active window for you to change slides. Be sure the presentation is the last thing you clicked on.</p>
<h2 id="01FZBT9M1ZK8J475SR08HGHADJ">Screen Sharing Google Slides</h2>
<p>You can screen share Google Slides as an application window but we would advise you to do it from Google Chrome and share it as a Chrome Tab. You can check out our <strong>Windows Chrome Guide</strong> for details.</p>
<h3 id="01FZBT9ZD409YC7KGV8Y8D2PDS">1 Monitor</h3>
<p>In this method we will be sharing the application window within Firefox. Sadly, due to how Firefox and application windows interact you may have black bar at the right and left of you screen share on the stage. The reason for this method is so the speaker can both see the presentation they are giving and the Welcome stage at the same time. It is especially good if the speaker is interested in seeing what sort of engagement is happening in the chat. </p>
<p id="01FZBT9M1Z46BNMXJ2X9YY35HW" class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong>Video walkthrough here:</strong></p>

<p>Have your Google Slides presentation loaded up in a separate window from Welcome. Then you will want to do is resize you windows so that you can see both the presentation software and Welcome Event<img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5380510104980/Resizing_Windows_window.gif" alt="Resizing Windows window.gif"></p>
<p>Get invited and join the green room, then click the "Present" button on the lower left-hand corner.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325969990932/speaker_present_button.png" alt="speaker present button.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Choose the window that has your Google Slides presentation. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5356420253204/mceclip3.png" alt="mceclip3.png"></p>
<p>Now go to your Google Slides presentation. Click on the down arrow button to the right of the "Slideshow" button. Then click on "Presenter view".</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5356550891924/firefox_presenter_view.png" alt="firefox_presenter_view.png"></p>
<p>You can then resize/move the application window to your liking while also being able to see the Welcome platform. You can use arrow keys to change slides and use the Presenter pop out to control the presentation. This might be easier than using the presentation window..</p>
<h3 id="01FZBTBA8E9E3WZ8SGRVGSSM9B">2 Monitor</h3>
<p>This is the easiest method to manage two different windows. On monitor will contain the presentation at full screen and the 2nd monitor will contain the Welcome event window. This way you don't have to worry about managing the different windows covering each other up.</p>
<p id="01FZBTBA8E1SY5RP3K1A5QQPHF" class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong>Video walkthrough here:</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/3a12e7365f8c452c85193eded39bd5f1" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Move your Welcome Window and your presentation windows to separate monitor screens. Have your Google Slides presentation loaded up by clicking "Slideshow" at the top right or in the "View" tab. </p>
<p><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5326145174292/present_button_for_google_slides.png" alt="present button for google slides.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Once you have entered the Green Room in the Welcome window, click the "Present" button on the lower left-hand corner.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5356788779284/speaker_present_button.png" alt="speaker_present_button.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Choose the screen with your Google Slides presentation in the drop down and click "Allow"</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5354441929620/mceclip2.png" alt="mceclip2.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">This will show your screen share in the Green Room. To change slides you will need to have it as your active window. You will be able to use the arrow key to move slides back and forth.</p>
