<h1>Closed Captions Guide</h1>
<p>Accessibility for your event is essential, and for many organizations, closed captioning may be a requirement. Welcome offers a closed captioning feature that meets the international WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards. If you are interested in this feature for your organization, please contact your Customer Success Manager for specifics. At the moment, closed captioning only captures live content on the stage (this does not include pre-recorded videos).</p>
