<h1>11/09/22 - Pinned Chats and Tidied Up Multi-Track Landing Page</h1>
<p>This week we launched a new feature, a cool QoL update, and some bug fixes.</p>
<h1 id="01GHM5ZBR4BRA8Y3SAQPW5NP1E">Features!</h1>
<p>Pinned Chats are here!! No longer do you need to spam important messages, links, PDFs and/or use the dreaded "scroll up" messaging. You can now pin them to the top of the chat. We also have a <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/10324589108628" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chat Guide</a> that goes over other chat features in detail.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Multi Track Landing pages got some love this update. Previously, it could be pretty confusing for some users. We removed quite a few things that were either clutter, duplicated information, and simply confusing. We also made adjustments for window scaling and you should now see a much more consistent view of the page even with smaller window dimensions. Lastly, you can now access the event agenda for all stages from the main landing page.</p>
