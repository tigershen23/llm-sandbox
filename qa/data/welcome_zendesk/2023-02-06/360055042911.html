<p dir="ltr"><strong>Upgraded pre-recorded video features </strong>We’ve now made sharing pre-recorded videos that much smoother. To move from live to pre-recorded seamlessly, we’ve added a fade to black on the main stage that will lead into the start of your pre-recorded video. You can also view the length of all of your videos in your multimedia panel - no more guessing the length.
