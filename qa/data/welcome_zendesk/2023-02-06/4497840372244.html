<strong>BETA:</strong>
<ul>
<li>We've added a deny list to give producers the ability to have a filter out registrations from email domains they do not want to have access to. This functions similarly to the domain allow list.

<li>
<p>Give producers the ability to allow attendees to hide their names or to hide all names by default in Q&amp;A by adding the following toggles. They are mutually exclusive so only one of them can be toggled on at once. Please message <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> if you would like this enabled for your organization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Private Q&amp;A (attendee’s choice) - Attendees can choose to hide their names when submitting questions.</li>
<li>Private Q&amp;A (all users)- All questions will have their names hidden.</li>

<h1>Fixes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash event for when a newly created asset doesn't have a name.</li>
<li>Added a fix for larger logos that were more square than wide (150px tall, 200px wide).</li>
<li>Added a fix for users who try to use QuickReg when the feature is off. It now redirects to login rather than just fail.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with stage manager hover buttons overlapping recording/doors open buttons by updating the layout.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash event when the a/v dialog is being opened and closed causing people to not be able to join Green Room or breakout.</li>
<li>Fixed an Agenda issue where the Agenda wasn’t sorting correctly by time.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the stage manager covering the stage on smaller screens.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where playing a prerecorded video that did not have an audio track would break recordings and certain attendee views.</li>
<li>Add "Powered by Welcome" with the Welcome logo to more places.</li>
<li>Polls in the attendee view will now be sorted by On Stage polls first, then Open polls, then Closed polls.</li>
<li>Removed attendee’s ability to download event recordings from the On-Demand screen.</li>
<li>Settings toggle cosmetic and text copy updates.</li>
<li>Fixed the Add to Calendar button for multiday events.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with redirect to mobile on iPad.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the ICS file (calendar invite) download button.</li>
<li>Switching between Public Chat and Room Chat no longer clears the Room Chat.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes in Lounges when users switch between Watch to Join mode their chat room section doesn't update and goes back to Public chat.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Q&amp;A with Moderation on for mobile forces user to a blank white screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Stage Manager would cover up the new poll dialog when a user hovered over the bottom right corner of the stage.</li>
<li>Added a fix for spammy speaker notifications caused when a speaker has a poor connection.</li>
<li>CSV's exported from excel can be more reliably imported into Welcome.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue found where an attendee/speaker can not see people on stage when joining the Green Room during a prerecorded video.</li>
<li>Improvements to the robustness of recording infrastructure.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the interaction panel scroll bar shows and hides repeatedly in Lounges.</li>
<li>Speaker notifications are now tied to the "Jump In" button. This should reduce the notification noise and be a bit more representative of when the Speaker actually joins the event.</li>
<li>Fixed the Compatibility Checker to reflect that we now support mobile and Safari.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when mobile video on iOS would stop after maximizing. A play button will now appear if the video stops.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where mobile audio would mute after first playing.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where joining a lounge in "Watch" mode would pop up an AV dialog.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where polls would display as "infinity" votes.</li>
