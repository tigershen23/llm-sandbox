<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>If you do not see your streaming service is enabled then you will need to follow the streaming services instructions to get to that point</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the streaming service is active next thing to check is if your Stream Keys and Stream URL are correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Head over to the Event Dashboard Streaming tab and check the key and URL for that streaming service
<ul>
<li>If <strong>Incorrect</strong>
<ul>
<li>Close the event doors</li>
<li>Edit or Delete the existing entry by clicking on the 3 stacked dots on the right</li>
<li>Enter/Paste the correct information</li>
<li>Open the event doors</li>
<li>The stream will re-initialize which can take 20 - 30 seconds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If <strong>Correct</strong>
<ul>
<li>Close the event doors</li>
<li>Wait 10 to 15 seconds</li>
<li>Open the event doors</li>
<li>The stream will re-initialize which can take 20 - 30 seconds</li>
<li>If error appears again reach out to Welcome Tech Support <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Inactive streams (more than 15 minutes of idle time) will time out even if content starts streaming after. You will need to restart the stream in this case by closing and then opening the doors.</p>
