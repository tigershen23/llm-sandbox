<h1>Integrations - Salesforce into Welcome</h1>
<h1 id="01G2Z03NTHF7N6S21WJ1G8KNJT"><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
<p>This article will go over instructions on how to configure Salesforce so that registrant information is sent to the Welcome platform seamlessly in real-time. This is a valuable integration to use when registrations for a Welcome Event are hosted outside of the registration process that Welcome provides, for example, a Pardot Landing Page. If you are looking for information on sending data from Welcome to Salesforce, please <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409970167444">click here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While Pardot is a valuable marketing tool to ingest attendee information into Salesforce, it is not a required piece of the technology stack to enable an integration with Welcome. The guide below will use Pardot as an example of the source of attendee data that feeds into Salesforce, but contains necessary information even if it is not being leveraged.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="01G2Z03NTJYPF5AR7CSKR1M0RS"><strong>User Permissions</strong></h2>
<p>In order to set up the integration, you will need the following user permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Producer" role in Welcome</li>
<li>A Salesforce User that permits writing and editing functions to custom fields, as well as the ability to set up and trigger Outbound Messages and Rules.</li>
<li>A Pardot Administrator (optional if Pardot is utilized)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="01G2Z03NTJ3FRHN3RA8900W0AC"><strong><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/e405692994974d8db77a837359466247" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a Prospect custom field in Pardot and sync to the Salesforce field name (lead object) named "Welcome Event Id"</li>
<li>Once a Campaign and its associated Landing Page is created, create a new automation rule with the following:
<ul>
<li>Assignment - Customize who you want the Prospect assignments to go to. This is important as Pardot will not sync with CRM (SFDC) if the Prospect is not assigned to a user. For the sake of the example, we will assign the CRM user to "Jonathan Kim"</li>
<li>Add to CRM Campaign - Select the SFDC Campaign this Prospect will sync with. Choose the status of the lead when synced with Salesforce</li>
<li>Change Prospect custom field - Select Welcome ID and input the 6 character string that represents your Welcome Event Id. This can be found on the Welcome Event Dashboard. You will need to do this for every new Welcome Event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The instructions below go over how to create custom fields in Salesforce and how to store a formula so that all custom fields are synced with the same value.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a custom field in Salesforce's Lead object labeled "<strong>Welcome Event Id</strong>". The field type must be text.</li>
<li>Create a custom field in Salesforce's Contact object labeled "<strong>Welcome Event Id</strong>". The field type must be text.</li>

<li>Create a custom field in Salesforce's Campaign Member object labeled "<strong>Welcome Event Id</strong>". The field type must be a Formula. Copy and paste this formula within the Advanced Formula field in the Custom Field Definition window. 
<pre>IF(<br><br>ISBLANK(ContactId),<br><br>Lead.Welcome_Event_Id__c,<br><br>Contact.Welcome_Event_Id__c <br><br>)</pre>
