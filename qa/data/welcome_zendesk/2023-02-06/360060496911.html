<h1>RTMP Out</h1>
<p>We now allow broadcasting your event to a 3rd party outside of the Welcome platform. Now, if you want to reach the widest audience possible, you can; Welcome is pre-configured to connect to YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook. We will also allow you to push your feed through custom RTMP settings. Check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058345371" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Streaming Out - General Guide</a> for further details.</p>
<h1>Watch Lounge</h1>
<p>We heard feedback that the 16 person limit for our lounges is a bummer, so we added the ability to watch our lounges. So, even when rooms are packed with 16 participants, you can still jump in and view the discussion in the room. Watchers can still interact through the room chat, and if a participant slot opens up, they can slide on in.
