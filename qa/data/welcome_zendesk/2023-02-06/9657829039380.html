<p>Agenda Builder is live for everyone to enjoy. This is a major update, it is a full revamp for both our agenda that was in the Event Dashboard and the multimedia panel in the Control Room. We have combined them both and now they are both managed in the Control Room. This new design will allow you to create your agenda, sessions, and organize your assets all in one place. Check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8439968702356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agenda Builder Guide</a> for specific details.</p>
