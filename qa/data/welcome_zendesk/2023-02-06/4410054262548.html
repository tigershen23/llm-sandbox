<h1>11/9/21</h1>
<p>Welcome back for another round of updates, fixes, and features!</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>BETA: Skip Welcome Registration Form</strong>
<ul>
<li>We are making a setting for previously registered attendees to jump right into events, without needing to confirm their information. When we know an attendee's first name, last name, email address, and they don't need to put in any required custom fields, they should be able to get into the event without seeing Welcome's registration form or entering a password.</li>
<li>

<p><strong>BETA: At-a-glance analytics</strong></p>

The At-a-glance analytics report makes it easy for customers to understand how their events are received by attendees. This is critical for helping our customers demonstrate the return on their investment in their events.<img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4410059408276/Untitled__1_.png" alt="Untitled__1_.png">
