for over 10 years.\\n\\n56\\n00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,700\\nHe's made relationships with some of the most popular restaurant groups in Austin.\\n\\n57\\n00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:09,800\\nOn, if you're

00:17:16,099\\nSo Chef Philip Speer who runs assembly.\\n\\n60\\n00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:30,900\\nAnd he's had four nominations with the James Beard Foundation hired, Chef Giovanni to come to become a key member of the His kitchen management team and their chef Giovanni serves as the sous chef for the Commodore.\\n\\n61\\n00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:38,200\\nAnd this is allowed him to expand his knowledge and his skills within modern Mexican Cuisine.\\n\\n62\\n00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:45,600\\nAnd so now, he operates as the executive chef at assembly kitchen leading the team with menu creation and talent screening.\\n\\n63\\n00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,900\\nSo with that Chef Giovanni.\\n\\n64\\n00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,400\\nJoin me on stage.\\n\\n65\\n00:17:49,400 -->

going to eat some really delicious food and enjoy each other's company.\\n\\n75\\n00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,400\\nSo let us do it.\\n\\n76\\n00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,500\\nPerfect.\\n\\n77\\n00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,100\\nWell, I think especially the best way to start off.\\n\\n78\\n00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,800\\nTaco Tuesday is with a God, dang, Margarita.\\n\\n79\\n00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,200\\nSo let us get right into it.\\n\\n80\\n00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,400\\nRight?\\n\\n81\\n00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,300\\nY'all, I would like to mention.\\n\\n82\\n00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,100\\nIf you have any questions whatsoever.\\n\\n83\\n00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,600\\nUnfortunately, I am not able to see you guys on my end of the screen.\\n\\n84\\n00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,000\\nBut please throw those questions right in the chat.\\n\\n85\\n00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,200\\nI can see it on the right of my monitor, and we can definitely get you, those answers, right?\\n\\n86\\n00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,200\\nSo, the best thing about this Margarita is that it's going to be ready in 30.\\n\\n87\\n00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,500\\nAgainst.\\n\\n88\\n00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,100\\nAll right.\\n\\n89\\n00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:59,500\\nSo all the items we will need for this Margarita as follows here, when Empty Glass, beautiful lime, our Margarita mixture here and I just have this little plate with my lime salt in it.\\n\\n90\\n00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,100\\nAlright.\\n\\n91\\n00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200\\nSo here we go, guys.\\n\\n92\\n00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,500\\nThis is a quick trick.\\n\\n93\\n00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,700\\nFirst thing I am going to do is, let us go ahead and cut this line right down the middle.\\n\\n94\\n00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:13,400\\nLike so, Then we're going to go ahead and grab a little wedge from this lime.\\n\\n95\\n00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,900\\nSlice it in the middle.\\n\\n96\\n00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:24,500\\nJust going to score it, allowing us to place it over our glass and really Rim it with this fresh lime juice.\\n\\n97\\n00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,400\\nMore flavor from here.\\n\\n98\\n00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,300\\nWe're just going to tip it right onto that glass.\\n\\n99\\n00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,200\\nSorry for the scratchy's sounds not pleasant.\\n\\n100\\n00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,700\\nBut here we go.\\n\\n101\\n00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,700\\nFill it up with ice like that.\\n\\n102\\n00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,900\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n103\\n00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,200\\nGood healthy, Shake.\\n\\n104\\n00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,000\\nEverybody get that.\\n\\n105\\n00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,400\\nTaco dance already started.\\n\\n106\\n00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,300\\nThis is where we're getting that move-in ready.\\n\\n107\\n00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900\\nGetting ready for it.\\n\\n108\\n00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,500\\nPop, the cap.\\n\\n109\\n00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,900\\nFill her up extra.\\n\\n110\\n00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,000\\nSqueeze of lime.\\n\\n111\\n00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,400\\nQuick Trick, there we go, guys.\\n\\n112\\n00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,200\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n113\\n00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,100\\nMargarita right in front of you.\\n\\n114\\n00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,700\\nCheers y'all.\\n\\n115\\n00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,200\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n116\\n00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,800\\nHow's it tasting?\\n\\n117\\n00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,600\\nEveryone like the margarita?\\n\\n118\\n00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,800\\nCheers, I love the chairs.\\n\\n119\\n00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,400\\nPerfect.\\n\\n120\\n00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,200\\nSuper Fresh lime juice, is exactly what makes this Margarita, really pop?\\n\\n121\\n00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,500\\nI like a little strawberry floater on my margarita.\\n\\n122\\n00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,600\\nSomeone asked do we like floaters here in Austin, Texas?\\n\\n123\\n00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,100\\nThat's a hell.\\n\\n124\\n00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,600\\nYes.\\n\\n125\\n00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,500\\nSo beautiful.\\n\\n126\\n00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,900\\nSo now that we got our drink settled in front of us.\\n\\n127\\n00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,500\\nWe can finally get to relax, you know, get our drinking on, it's only makes us better chefs and the end of it.\\n\\n128\\n00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,400\\nI think it's also going to make us a little more confident.\\n\\n129\\n00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,600\\nSo when we are cooking these tacos, everything is pre cooked for you.\\n\\n130\\n00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,500\\nWe're really just looking to get those garnishes on the plate.\\n\\n131\\n00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,400\\nWe're looking to heat up this meat or vegetables depending on the kit you get.\\n\\n132\\n00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,200\\nAnd then so it's really simple trick.\\n\\n133\\n00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,300\\nWe got our super nice tacos.\\n\\n134\\n00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,300\\nIt's going to feed a lot of people.\\n\\n135\\n00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,200\\nTonight.\\n\\n136\\n00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,200\\nSo if you have anyone in your house with you, please tag them along and let us get on with the show.\\n\\n137\\n00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600\\nSo we got our drink out of the way, right?\\n\\n138\\n00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,200\\nLet us go ahead and talk about utensils and tools.\\n\\n139\\n00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,200\\nOkay, super, super simple.\\n\\n140\\n00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,200\\nThe most things we were going to be needing is actually pans, right?\\n\\n141\\n00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,600\\nBecause we have got three proteins.\\n\\n142\\n00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,300\\nWe got a Carnitas, we have chicken tinga, and we have our Koji marinated skirt steak.\\n\\n143\\n00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,200\\nIf you did get the vegetarian, you're going to have our much.\\n\\n144\\n00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,000\\nShroom mixture, some miso carrots, and also a butternut squash to saute.\\n\\n145\\n00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,400\\nSuper, super simple.\\n\\n146\\n00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,700\\nSo like I said, it's going to be a majority of pans.\\n\\n147\\n00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,800\\nBut let us go ahead and talk about utensils.\\n\\n148\\n00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,000\\nGot our chef knife, right.\\n\\n149\\n00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:59,300\\nBeautiful cutting board, of course, and then just now near me.\\n\\n150\\n00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,000\\nI have a little spatula.\\n\\n151\\n00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,600\\nDefinitely going to need that for our homemade tortillas.\\n\\n152\\n00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,000\\nI love to have these little tongues as well.\\n\\n153\\n00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,000\\nAnd then I just have a small amount of spoons here.\\n\\n154\\n00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:23,500\\nIs it going to help with pulling out any ingredients out of those packaging and just kind of make our life a little easier when we're saucing when we're putting some, you know, Salsas and ramekins, super simple.\\n\\n155\\n00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,600\\nOf course.\\n\\n156\\n00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,800\\nI have a couple Linens as well.\\n\\n157\\n00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,200\\nNow you guys, if you don't have a tortilla holder too warm to keep our tortillas nice and warm.\\n\\n158\\n00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,600\\nWhile we're eating our tacos.\\n\\n159\\n00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,600\\nThe linen will definitely work as the trick, right?\\n\\n160\\n00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,700\\nWe're going to use It as a steamer once we have our hot tortillas.\\n\\n161\\n00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,400\\nSo make sure you at least have an extra clean linen.\\n\\n162\\n00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,000\\nAlongside.\\n\\n163\\n00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,900\\nI am going to go ahead and bring you over to my stove here.\\n\\n164\\n00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,100\\nSo you will see, I do have a decent amount of pans right now.\\n\\n165\\n00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,900\\nThe saucepan in the middle here is going to be for my chicken tinga.\\n\\n166\\n00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:10,100\\nSo make sure you guys have a small sauce pot for your chicken tinga and then I have to cast iron pans here just for my other proteins, my Carnitas and also my steak.\\n\\n167\\n00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:23,300\\nSo for the vegetarian out there, I just like to go ahead and use a sheet tray with a little bit of foil on it, because we can actually go ahead and just roast our It's alongside our butternut squash.\\n\\n168\\n00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,400\\nOkay, alongside that sheet tray for my vegetarian.\\n\\n169\\n00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,100\\nVegan friend.\\n\\n170\\n00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,000\\nYou will need at least one cast, iron pan.\\n\\n171\\n00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,200\\nAnd that's going to be for your mushrooms.\\n\\n172\\n00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:40,400\\nNow, you will notice I have this really large, kind of flat top attachment on my stove as well.\\n\\n173\\n00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,700\\nNow for me, this is the best thing you can possibly use to heat up tortilla.\\n\\n174\\n00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,000\\nIt's right.\\n\\n175\\n00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,900\\nWe don't want to go ahead and heat up one towards he at a time.\\n\\n176\\n00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:56,200\\nLetting it get cold in the You know, after we're cooking it, so for me, I love to be able to cook at least six tortillas on this flat top.\\n\\n177\\n00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,000\\nNow.\\n\\n178\\n00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,200\\nIf you guys don't have a flat top like this, just having another large cast, iron pan will definitely do the trick.\\n\\n179\\n00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,700\\nAll right.\\n\\n180\\n00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,900\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n181\\n00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,100\\nHow's the margarita going?\\n\\n182\\n00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,400\\nHopefully, no one went ahead and chugged it.\\n\\n183\\n00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,300\\nIt is only Tuesday, but no, shame.\\n\\n184\\n00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,300\\nPerfect.\\n\\n185\\n00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:26,200\\nOther than that, guy's if you were had your box in front of you, feel free to go ahead and pull out all the ingredients and just kind of neatly lined them up in front of your cooking station, makes your life a little bit easier.\\n\\n186\\n00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,400\\nAnd other than that, I think we can go ahead and is it is only Tuesday?\\n\\n187\\n00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,200\\nI know it looks like Friday outside plus we got it is Wednesday.\\n\\n188\\n00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,900\\nOh my God, you guys are totally, right.\\n\\n189\\n00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,500\\nWe're going to act like, it's Friday, even though it's Taco Tuesday on this Wednesday.\\n\\n190\\n00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,500\\nIf that Sounds.\\n\\n191\\n00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,100\\nAll right, beautiful.\\n\\n192\\n00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,900\\nThank you for keeping me in check over there.\\n\\n193\\n00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,900\\nMcCoy.\\n\\n194\\n00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,900\\nDefinitely with the knowledge great.\\n\\n195\\n00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,300\\nSo we do have a little protein prep just to get started beforehand.\\n\\n196\\n00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:08,300\\nI also would like Zachary that my loan vegetarian not to section you off, but go ahead and pre-heat your oven to 375.\\n\\n197\\n00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,500\\nAll right, Zachary only for Zachary.\\n\\n198\\n00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,100\\nHe is a special person in this entire group.\\n\\n199\\n00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,700\\nGroup, and we all love him for them.\\n\\n200\\n00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,400\\nGreat.\\n\\n201\\n00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,800\\nSo back into our small amount of protein prep.\\n\\n202\\n00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,400\\nAll I am going to do here.\\n\\n203\\n00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:31,200\\nAnd after the protein prep will go ahead and jump into our side rooms, but just a couple steps before we do that for my protein prep.\\n\\n204\\n00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,800\\nI really just want to go ahead and start getting all this meat out and be able to breathe especially the stake here.\\n\\n205\\n00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,800\\nOkay, so just getting a steak right out of our compostable packaging here.\\n\\n206\\n00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,700\\nI am going to go ahead and just lay it on a linen.\\n\\n207\\n00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,100\\nJust to kind of soak up some of that liquid.\\n\\n208\\n00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,500\\nIf you don't want to use a linen just for this, we can go ahead and just have a paper towel.\\n\\n209\\n00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,600\\nWill definitely do the trick.\\n\\n210\\n00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,900\\nOkay, I have a thousand of these Linens though.\\n\\n211\\n00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:02,300\\nSo I have no shame in using that beautiful one protein prep down.\\n\\n212\\n00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,700\\nAnd as I did mention, these bags are 100% compostable.\\n\\n213\\n00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,900\\nSo if you guys have little home compost, compost at your house, please, just throw them in there.\\n\\n214\\n00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,900\\nThey will buy generally degrade.\\n\\n215\\n00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,500\\nNext up.\\n\\n216\\n00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,700\\nI am going to go ahead and just get my chicken tinga in the sauce pot.\\n\\n217\\n00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,100\\nOkay.\\n\\n218\\n00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,600\\nNow I don't want to turn on that sauce pot.\\n\\n219\\n00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,800\\nI just want to get it in there.\\n\\n220\\n00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:33,300\\nOkay, just like we said this is just a small amount of prep work before the fun really begins.\\n\\n221\\n00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,900\\nSo right into my pot, make sure you get all of those sauces from this packaging.\\n\\n222\\n00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,400\\nThey're so delicious.\\n\\n223\\n00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,400\\nJust like the squeeze out with your hands, just like that.\\n\\n224\\n00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,600\\nFantastic, and then just going to put the lid back on.\\n\\n225\\n00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,900\\nLike I said, we're not turning on that pot just yet.\\n\\n226\\n00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900\\nWe're just getting it ready.\\n\\n227\\n00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,400\\nAll right.\\n\\n228\\n00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,000\\nNow that leaves us with our Carnitas, the Carnitas can actually stay in the bag here.\\n\\n229\\n00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,400\\nBut I am just going to go ahead and open them up.\\n\\n230\\n00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:16,900\\nI like to open the entire packaging up just, so we keep a nice flat surface for the Carnitas, and we will go ahead and show you why that's important a little bit later.\\n\\n231\\n00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000\\nBut as you can see, just opening it up like a book.\\n\\n232\\n00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,700\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n233\\n00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,300\\nThat will do the trick.\\n\\n234\\n00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,700\\nHere we go.\\n\\n235\\n00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,800\\nSo now we got all our proteins, nice and prepped.\\n\\n236\\n00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:42,600\\nChickens in the sauce, pot, steaks, drying out a little bit on a paper towel, Carnitas are opened up getting ready for that cook along.\\n\\n237\\n00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:49,500\\nOkay, so we will go ahead and just make sure you hit except on your break rooms here and I will see you guys back here in about seven minutes or so.\\n\\n238\\n00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,800\\nSo you guys enjoy that margarita.\\n\\n239\\n00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,300\\nI also have a dog.\\n\\n240\\n00:27:59,300 -->

00:37:04,100\\nThe Margaritas are really fantastic.\\n\\n273\\n00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,100\\nSo let us get kind of down into the grittiness of setting up our clatter.\\n\\n274\\n00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,400\\nRight?\\n\\n275\\n00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,700\\nSo this is going to be called armies and place.\\n\\n276\\n00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,800\\nDoes anyone know what Mason pluses by chance?\\n\\n277\\n00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,100\\nHas anyone watched the Food Network and heard that?\\n\\n278\\n00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,600\\nPut your answer in the chat really

00:37:24,900\\nThat's exactly it.\\n\\n282\\n00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,200\\nSo, we're getting everything in its place.\\n\\n283\\n00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,500\\nThat's mise-en-place.\\n\\n284\\n00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,100\\nRight?\\n\\n285\\n00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:37,300\\nSo what to means in place for this taco event is going to be, is getting are those little garnishes all those beautiful colors right on the plate first?\\n\\n286\\n00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:43,100\\nOkay, and the very first amazing plus, I think that we can essentially do get our prep ready is.\\n\\n287\\n00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,600\\nI have our 2, beautiful Salsas here and all I did was put them right into little ramekins.\\n\\n288\\n00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:55,700\\nNow, this is sounds like a really small step but Actually adds a lot of value to the perceived value of this ditch.\\n\\n289\\n00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,000\\nRight?\\n\\n290\\n00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,900\\nWe took the time to went ahead and separate our Salsas.\\n\\n291\\n00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,800\\nWe can use them throughout the night.\\n\\n292\\n00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,700\\nIt looks beautiful.\\n\\n293\\n00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,100\\nJust nice off into their ramekins.\\n\\n294\\n00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,700\\nSo let us go ahead and start by doing soap, right?\\n\\n295\\n00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,400\\nI am looking for a nice plate skills tonight.\\n\\n296\\n00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,000\\nOkay, and we can actually do that with just using our vision.\\n\\n297\\n00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:22,700\\nHaving these beautiful colors that were about to display on our plate, is actually going to be kind of the plate up of this platter at itself.\\n\\n298\\n00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,700\\nOther than that, I am going to go ahead and grab my platter for this evening.\\n\\n299\\n00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,200\\nThis is beautiful, nice white large plate.\\n\\n300\\n00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:39,100\\nIt's going to have plenty of surface area for me to work with all my garnishes have all three of my All-Star meats, or All is right in the center.\\n\\n301\\n00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,000\\nSo go ahead and find yourselves a beautiful, nice platter like this.\\n\\n302\\n00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,600\\nOkay, and the first thing I am going to be adding to this platter.\\n\\n303\\n00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,800\\nWe have those pesky lines from that Margarita.\\n\\n304\\n00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,600\\nSo I think, let us go ahead and just finish the job.\\n\\n305\\n00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,100\\nRight?\\n\\n306\\n00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,900\\nWe have about three quarters of a margarita.\\n\\n307\\n00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,500\\nWe have our knife and let us just go ahead and create the rest into wedges here.\\n\\n308\\n00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,800\\nLike so beautiful.\\n\\n309\\n00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:13,500\\nNo, Taco is complete without a nice fresh Spritz of that line.\\n\\n310\\n00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,400\\nIt's right there.\\n\\n311\\n00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000\\nAnd I am just going to start playing with colors here.\\n\\n312\\n00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,800\\nI think we should go ahead and do for the most part.\\n\\n313\\n00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,300\\nAll of our knife work.\\n\\n314\\n00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,500\\nNow here.\\n\\n315\\n00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,300\\nI have my market vegetables.\\n\\n316\\n00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:35,200\\nThese are going to be just fresh seasonal, vegetables, that freshness of the vegetable actually gives a lot of texture to a taco.\\n\\n317\\n00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,600\\nI love the little bite of a radish and between some carnitas.\\n\\n318\\n00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,900\\nSo let us go ahead and attack that.\\n\\n319\\n00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,400\\nSo just slicing off the top of the package.\\n\\n320\\n00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,600\\nThese vegetables have already been pre-washed for you.\\n\\n321\\n00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:57,700\\nSo you can see I have a little yellow carrot and also this just beautiful cherry bomb of a radish are so using my fingertips here.\\n\\n322\\n00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,400\\nI am going to actually claw the item.\\n\\n323\\n00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,000\\nNow.\\n\\n324\\n00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,100\\nI don't want anyone.\\n\\n325\\n00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:09,600\\nWe're going to do a little pre lesson on how to properly cut something as you can see on a professional chef and I have all 10.\\n\\n326\\n00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,800\\nAnd my fingers, still tell you, I know what I am talking about, right?\\n\\n327\\n00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,200\\nSo when I cut anything, I am always clawing the Mmm, usually, with these three fingers here.\\n\\n328\\n00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,100\\nOkay, so I am gripping it.\\n\\n329\\n00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:31,700\\nAnd as you can tell, when I grip it, my Knuckles kind of protrude out word, which allows me to kind of rest, my knife amongst my Knuckles.\\n\\n330\\n00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:39,500\\nAnd as you can see, my fingertips will naturally kind of push inward being hidden from my knife blade itself.\\n\\n331\\n00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,300\\nSo let us think a little smart here as well.\\n\\n332\\n00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,400\\nThis thing rolls around like crazy.\\n\\n333\\n00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,000\\nSo let us go ahead and give it some nice.\\n\\n334\\n00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,200\\nFlat edges.\\n\\n335\\n00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,200\\nNice flat surface to work on.\\n\\n336\\n00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,300\\nThis looks like a nice little heart.\\n\\n337\\n00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,100\\nLet us hear you guys.\\n\\n338\\n00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,500\\nThere we go, beautiful.\\n\\n339\\n00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,200\\nSo now we have a, we have a flat surface radish.\\n\\n340\\n00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,700\\nMy fingertips are gripping.\\n\\n341\\n00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:08,700\\nThe item Knuckles are, protruding outward firm grip on my knife.\\n\\n342\\n00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:17,900\\nAnd I am just slicing right through and a rocking motion, until I meet an apex in which my reddish is no longer.\\n\\n343\\n00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:24,300\\nA safe kind of on this Edge, so I am a tilted back down and then just attack the other side.\\n\\n344\\n00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,100\\nDefinitely not a race.\\n\\n345\\n00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,400\\nWe want nice thin slices a vegetable here, okay.\\n\\n346\\n00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,200\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n347\\n00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,300\\nNow, we kind of made it a little easier ready for you with the carrot.\\n\\n348\\n00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,000\\nIt's got a nice flat surface.\\n\\n349\\n00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,500\\nAnd for me, I like these to kind of mimic the size of the taco.\\n\\n350\\n00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,000\\nSo I am going to go ahead and cut them at a diagonal bias.\\n\\n351\\n00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,700\\nSo they're a little larger, and they just fit nicely onto my taco.\\n\\n352\\n00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,900\\nSo just like that.\\n\\n353\\n00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,200\\nA nice little sweetness from the carrot, alongside its texture.\\n\\n354\\n00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,600\\nAnd the crunch makes her a really nice little taco garnish.\\n\\n355\\n00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,100\\nSo here we just have our beautiful little bundle.\\n\\n356\\n00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,900\\nShowing off those knife skills.\\n\\n357\\n00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,600\\nEveryone's got their finger tips.\\n\\n358\\n00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,300\\nI hope.\\n\\n359\\n00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,200\\nAnd we're going to roll.\\n\\n360\\n00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,400\\nBut look at that already.\\n\\n361\\n00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:22,500\\nThe color of these to the grain from the line, the beautiful carrot alongside the radish, makes this look really beautiful.\\n\\n362\\n00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:30,000\\nNow, let us go ahead and finish off a little of this knife work here and I think we're going to do some of this charred onion here.\\n\\n363\\n00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,600\\nSlicing it rights?\\n\\n364\\n00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,700\\nOpen like that.\\n\\n365\\n00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:39,400\\nNow you will notice on this onion itself, the root system is still attached.\\n\\n366\\n00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,400\\nSo just this little button, has the roots still attached.\\n\\n367\\n00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,200\\nAll we want to do is slice that off.\\n\\n368\\n00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,200\\nDon't want to eat that.\\n\\n369\\n00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,100\\nUsing that same technique.\\n\\n370\\n00:42:51,100 --> 00:43:01,300\\nI am gripping these onion, this onion here, and I am just going to make small little ribbon, so I can go ahead and put this throughout my taco of my choosing.\\n\\n371\\n00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,800\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n372\\n00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,000\\nFun.\\n\\n373\\n00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,200\\nThis right back to our platter.\\n\\n374\\n00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,500\\nLove the translucent color.\\n\\n375\\n00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,400\\nFantastic.\\n\\n376\\n00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,900\\nNow I am going to go ahead and reach for my chili Tori.\\n\\n377\\n00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:34,400\\nAh, do so, anyone know what a chili Tory Auto is Can anyone guess what pepper this is in this package?\\n\\n378\\n00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,000\\nI know there're some Californians out there.\\n\\n379\\n00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,900\\nSo they definitely know what this is here.\\n\\n380\\n00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:48,700\\nI just got a nice, beautiful charred jalapeno and which we then quick pickle with a little lime juice.\\n\\n381\\n00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,900\\nOkay, so it's got that dark bite from the grill.\\n\\n382\\n00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,000\\nIt's got that acidic punch to it from the lime.\\n\\n383\\n00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,200\\nAnd I am just going to strike off the stem.\\n\\n384\\n00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,300\\nNow, if you guys don't like the spiciness of this jalapeno, all too much.\\n\\n385\\n00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,300\\nWe can go ahead and de-seed it from the inside.\\n\\n386\\n00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:18,800\\nSo, just slicing the center open, not all the way through, but just enough to expose those seeds, you can use the back of your knife.\\n\\n387\\n00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,200\\nTo just scrape nice and easily out like so.\\n\\n388\\n00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,200\\nFor me, I like the chili.\\n\\n389\\n00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:34,200\\nSo I am going to go ahead and put them right back in, and I am just going to slice nice, beautiful wedges of this jalapeno.\\n\\n390\\n00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,000\\nFantastic, nice hatch, stick.\\n\\n391\\n00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:44,400\\nAnd I am going to rest that directly right on top of my onions.\\n\\n392\\n00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,600\\nLet us see where you guys are at.\\n\\n393\\n00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,100\\nOkay, beautiful head on a swivel.\\n\\n394\\n00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:56,700\\nLove it.\\n\\n395\\n00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,600\\nSomeone's thinking on their feet.\\n\\n396\\n00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,100\\nThat's a true.\\n\\n397\\n00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,700\\nChef move.\\n\\n398\\n00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,300\\nGreat job.\\n\\n399\\n00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:07,400\\nSo here, just to show you what I am working with so far, have a couple of my garnishes.\\n\\n400\\n00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,200\\nNow.\\n\\n401\\n00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,700\\nLet us add a little more brightness to this, right?\\n\\n402\\n00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,300\\nIt's kind of getting a little mold down with these charred, vegetable garnishes with the onion and the jalapeno.\\n\\n403\\n00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,100\\nWhat I want you guys to go ahead and reach for next is what's called.\\n\\n404\\n00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,100\\nNeed pack that you need.\\n\\n405\\n00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,600\\nPeck is a very traditional Yucatan style garnish.\\n\\n406\\n00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:41,400\\nYou often find these on tostadas and Tacos, but the thing that's so special about SHINee, Peck is the pickling liquid, which usually tends to be vinegar, has been swapped out for citrus juices.\\n\\n407\\n00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:52,900\\nSo, in this, we have pickled it with orange juice, lime juice, and a little habanero pieces, just to give it a nice kick and it's got some good sweetness from those juices themselves.\\n\\n408\\n00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,000\\nAnd you can just see the color of it is just absolutely stunning.\\n\\n409\\n00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,900\\nSo, just using your fingertips, we're here to get messy.\\n\\n410\\n00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:02,800\\nKind of drain.\\n\\n411\\n00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,500\\nThese onions?\\n\\n412\\n00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,600\\nRight out.\\n\\n413\\n00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,900\\nThese are some of my favorite garnishes for a steak taco.\\n\\n414\\n00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,600\\nSo beautiful.\\n\\n415\\n00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,100\\nIt's like that.\\n\\n416\\n00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:25,200\\nSo you can see how I am actually using the rim of my plate, to really set the boundary for all of our garnishes.\\n\\n417\\n00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,000\\nRight?\\n\\n418\\n00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,900\\nSo we're thinking the little smart here and then next up.\\n\\n419\\n00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,000\\nI am going to go ahead and reach for some fresh cilantro.\\n\\n420\\n00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,900\\nLet us live in this thing up with a little more fresh herbs here, okay.\\n\\n421\\n00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:43,500\\nNow just a couple more steps before we do break off into your breakout rooms once more.\\n\\n422\\n00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,000\\nSo really take the time to set off these garnishes really beautifully.\\n\\n423\\n00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,900\\nFeel free to take a couple of those photos once you guys are in there, but just grabbing the cilantro.\\n\\n424\\n00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,200\\nIt's already been picked for you.\\n\\n425\\n00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,200\\nWe did the hard stuff.\\n\\n426\\n00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,600\\nIt's already been washed.\\n\\n427\\n00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,000\\nSo just give it a little volume, right?\\n\\n428\\n00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,200\\nBut something's nice and Tall on a play.\\n\\n429\\n00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,900\\nIt just speaks so much louder.\\n\\n430\\n00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,500\\nLook so much more beautiful.\\n\\n431\\n00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,400\\nAnd now, pair them with our house bar herbs.\\n\\n432\\n00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,900\\nThis is just from a local hyper local Farm here in Austin Texas.\\n\\n433\\n00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,000\\nThat grows these beautiful little field herbs.\\n\\n434\\n00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800\\nNow, not only do they just look gorgeous.\\n\\n435\\n00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,200\\nThey really do add a lot of different flavors.\\n\\n436\\n00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:34,100\\nNow if you have any large pieces like this, Malabar spinach here, feel free to just pick it with your fingers, tear it up into some bite-sized pieces.\\n\\n437\\n00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,500\\nThose flowers are edible.\\n\\n438\\n00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,000\\nThey just give a nice little beautiful.\\n\\n439\\n00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,500\\nLook to your plate.\\n\\n440\\n00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,000\\nHere we go.\\n\\n441\\n00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,300\\nNow, I am starting to get a little more green on my plate.\\n\\n442\\n00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,500\\nSo, let us go ahead and lighten up the mood.\\n\\n443\\n00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,800\\nWe have this beautiful quesillo.\\n\\n444\\n00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,200\\nThey will.\\n\\n445\\n00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,900\\nHaka that we get imported at the restaurant.\\n\\n446\\n00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,600\\nEvery single Friday, from Oaxaca.\\n\\n447\\n00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:13,400\\nThis is the most insanely delicious cheese you have ever had the way that it's made is that it's stretched and continuously stretched and balled up into a nice large ball.\\n\\n448\\n00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,900\\nSo here we have those Strands of it.\\n\\n449\\n00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:24,000\\nSo just pick it with your fingers, definitely snag a little piece for the enjoyment, pre taco.\\n\\n450\\n00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,900\\nBut this on top of the chicken tinga just makes it so delicious.\\n\\n451\\n00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,200\\nSo here we go.\\n\\n452\\n00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,500\\nAnd then that leaves me with our last garnish here, which is this avocado.\\n\\n453\\n00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:49,800\\nSo, the avocado is bagged because we went ahead and just slice the avocado down the middle, just to make sure you guys are getting a nice, beautiful, non bruised, avocado.\\n\\n454\\n00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:57,400\\nSo once we slice it, we sealed it right back up as if it was brand-new and it is absolutely fantastic.\\n\\n455\\n00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,400\\nYou will notice the seed is still in the avocado that helps.\\n\\n456\\n00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,200\\nThe my stay oxidation of it.\\n\\n457\\n00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,700\\nSo for the last kind of knife work prep.\\n\\n458\\n00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,700\\nWe have we just have to deep it.\\n\\n459\\n00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,400\\nThis avocado seed.\\n\\n460\\n00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,200\\nGently striking the center of the avocado with your middle of your knife.\\n\\n461\\n00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,500\\nGet in there.\\n\\n462\\n00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,000\\nCounter twist both hands.\\n\\n463\\n00:49:22,000 -->

everyone's super amazing job now.\\n\\n508\\n01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,200\\nIt's on to the cooking part, right?\\n\\n509\\n01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,300\\nThe very most important thing about cooking is proper.\\n\\n510\\n01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,300\\nOn our pans or oven, right?\\n\\n511\\n01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,500\\nSo we need to make sure these pans are nice and hot.\\n\\n512\\n01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,700\\nThis is why I love to use cast iron.\\n\\n513\\n01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:24,900\\nIt retains its heat much, much better than most pans, and it's also really simple to clean out.\\n\\n514\\n01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,400\\nYou rinse it, wipe it out.\\n\\n515\\n01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,500\\nWith a paper towel.\\n\\n516\\n01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,100\\nIt just keeps on getting better.\\n\\n517\\n01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,400\\nThe seasoning on the pan itself grows with you while you're kind of cooking.\\n\\n518\\n01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:37,300\\nSo the first thing I want to do come with me to my range here.\\n\\n519\\n01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,700\\nZachary, you got your oven on?\\n\\n520\\n01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,700\\nYes, sir.\\n\\n521\\n01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,400\\nGreat.\\n\\n522\\n01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,500\\nSo our oven on is for our vegetarian option.\\n\\n523\\n01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,400\\nMr. Exact.\\n\\n524\\n01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,000\\nEveryone else should be working with this.\\n\\n525\\n01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,300\\nThese pans here.\\n\\n526\\n01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:50,800\\nOkay.\\n\\n527\\n01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,600\\nSo for me, the very first thing, we have our chicken tinga in our sauce pot.\\n\\n528\\n01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:01,300\\nI am going to go ahead and start that first, and I am going to turn it on very low.\\n\\n529\\n01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,900\\nI just want a nice simmer on my chicken tinga.\\n\\n530\\n01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,700\\nI don't want to reduce my sauce.\\n\\n531\\n01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,400\\nIn there all that much.\\n\\n532\\n01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,300\\nI just really want to warm up this chicken.\\n\\n533\\n01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:11,800\\nOkay.\\n\\n534\\n01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:22,000\\nSo the very first thing we're going kind of reverse, little Seer here, chicken tinga on low heat with my other pans.\\n\\n535\\n01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,300\\nI am going to go ahead and turn on my tortilla pan.\\n\\n536\\n01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,900\\nSo this will be your largest pan.\\n\\n537\\n01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000\\nAnd I also want this on low.\\n\\n538\\n01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,800\\nSo by time or mates are nice and Cooked.\\n\\n539\\n01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:44,300\\nOur tortilla pan will be nice and ready just to warm up these House made Tortillas, okay, and that leaves me with my two solo pants here.\\n\\n540\\n01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:51,900\\nOne for my carnitas, one, for my steak, now, Zachary with a vegetarian option.\\n\\n541\\n01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,400\\nOne of these pans will go ahead and be for our mushrooms.\\n\\n542\\n01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:55,900\\nOkay.\\n\\n543\\n01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,400\\nSo here we have the mon.\\n\\n544\\n01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,200\\nI am going to go ahead and start preheating.\\n\\n545\\n01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,200\\nMy pans to just under medium heat.\\n\\n546\\n01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,800\\nI want a nice and hot.\\n\\n547\\n01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,900\\nBut I don't want to really burn down the place, right?\\n\\n548\\n01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,000\\nSo let us just get that going, beautiful.\\n\\n549\\n01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,800\\nThis is a nice little Pro tip as well.\\n\\n550\\n01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,800\\nAs you can see that, I have a bunch of items cooking.\\n\\n551\\n01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,300\\nNow.\\n\\n552\\n01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:25,700\\nI am always very cautious that I have my handles of my pans, kind of facing the same way.\\n\\n553\\n01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,200\\nRight?\\n\\n554\\n01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,700\\nAnd I never want those handles to be in front of the stove.\\n\\n555\\n01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,200\\nJust in case you got a kid running around that dog.\\n\\n556\\n01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,500\\nIs maybe pulling up here.\\n\\n557\\n01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,100\\nThey're going to knock this thing.\\n\\n558\\n01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:40,600\\nI am always having my pans, just consciously in a single Direction, okay.\\n\\n559\\n01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,700\\nSo now that our pans are starting to warm up.\\n\\n560\\n01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,100\\nOnce again on that Medium.\\n\\n561\\n01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:55,100\\nI am going to grab that neutral oil that we sent you and I want half of that neutral oil and to each of your pants.\\n\\n562\\n01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,600\\nOkay, just like that.\\n\\n563\\n01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:01,800\\nNow, this neutral oil has a higher smoke point.\\n\\n564\\n01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:12,200\\nThat smoke point is going to allow us to get a hotter temperature on her oil which is going to have us have a better texture on our Carnitas are Steak, right?\\n\\n565\\n01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:16,900\\nSo I want you guys to keep a close eye on your pans.\\n\\n566\\n01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:23,000\\nNot looking for a billowing of smoke, but just a small little faint hint of smoke.\\n\\n567\\n01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000\\nThat's the pan saying hey, I am here to party.\\n\\n568\\n01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,700\\nLet us get it going.\\n\\n569\\n01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:33,500\\nOkay, now for Zach with our vegetarian, I am going to go ahead and jump on that for a moment.\\n\\n570\\n01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,700\\nI am going to go ahead and open up our me so grilled carrots.\\n\\n571\\n01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:38,500\\nRight here.\\n\\n572\\n01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,300\\nWe have that and then I have our sweet potato.\\n\\n573\\n01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,000\\nThat's been part roasted.\\n\\n574\\n01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,100\\nOkay, both of these packages are now open.\\n\\n575\\n01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,100\\nWe're going to go ahead and grab my sheet tray.\\n\\n576\\n01:04:52,600 --> 01:05:03,900\\nNow Zach feel free to go ahead and salt Tay these vegetables instead if you want a little more live action, but for me, I just like to kind of continue to roast them.\\n\\n577\\n01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,700\\nSo one side is going to have my beautiful.\\n\\n578\\n01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:07,900\\nIt's on there.\\n\\n579\\n01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,600\\nThe other my sweet potato.\\n\\n580\\n01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:19,200\\nAnd now that neutral oil, instead of using it on the pan, Zachary go ahead and just sprinkle a little bit directly on top.\\n\\n581\\n01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:26,100\\nBeautiful, and I am going to go straight into the oven with these vegetables.\\n\\n582\\n01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,400\\nIt's like that.\\n\\n583\\n01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,800\\nAnd on that last three minute cook for these vegetables.\\n\\n584\\n01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:38,100\\nI am going to actually switch the oven to the broil setting which is going to cook from the above.\\n\\n585\\n01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,100\\nPoint of the stove.\\n\\n586\\n01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:44,300\\nIt's going to give a nice color to those carrots and those sweet potatoes in there.\\n\\n587\\n01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:44,600\\nOkay?\\n\\n588\\n01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:51,500\\nBack to my mate folk garnishes on our plate, polish off to the side.\\n\\n589\\n01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:58,300\\nI am going to probably start with my stake here because it's going to need to rest after we cook it.\\n\\n590\\n01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,600\\nSo we have the oil in the pan.\\n\\n591\\n01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,500\\nIt's on medium Heat.\\n\\n592\\n01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,000\\nGoing to be there in about 20 seconds, for sure.\\n\\n593\\n01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:11,200\\nNow, when I grab my piece of steak, And this is the pan.\\n\\n594\\n01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:11,600\\nImagine.\\n\\n595\\n01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,700\\nThis is the pan here.\\n\\n596\\n01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,300\\nI am going to lay the steak, just the tip of it.\\n\\n597\\n01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,000\\nIn the pan must hear the sizzle.\\n\\n598\\n01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,600\\nAnd if you're not hearing the sizzle, pull it right out.\\n\\n599\\n01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:23,800\\nJust wait a little bit.\\n\\n600\\n01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,000\\nLet us see.\\n\\n601\\n01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,700\\nLet me answer a question really quick.\\n\\n602\\n01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,700\\nThat grape seed is not olive oil.\\n\\n603\\n01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:35,500\\nOlive oil is not actually the best oil to use for sauteing items because it has a really low smoke point.\\n\\n604\\n01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:40,000\\nSo when you're sautéing something really hot and olive oil, you're burning the olive oil.\\n\\n605\\n01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,700\\nAnd we have all probably seen, how all of oil can get $25 a bottle.\\n\\n606\\n01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,700\\nYou're kind of just wasting money when you're sautéing and olive oil.\\n\\n607\\n01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:53,600\\nNow, Italian recipes, I am Italian, do call for sweating things and olive oil.\\n\\n608\\n01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,200\\nAnd that's just a really shallow kind of low heat.\\n\\n609\\n01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,600\\nSo this is actually grapeseed oil.\\n\\n610\\n01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:07,200\\nBut what we got going on with the steak, want to hear the sizzle, and then we're going to drop away from us.\\n\\n611\\n01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,000\\nSo that oil doesn't potentially splatter on.\\n\\n612\\n01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:10,600\\nTo us.\\n\\n613\\n01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,400\\nDo you recommend turning on the vent Hood?\\n\\n614\\n01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,900\\nIt might get a little hot in here.\\n\\n615\\n01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,600\\nAnd my pan looks nice and ready.\\n\\n616\\n01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:27,400\\nSo, starting with that steak can see the oil, the viscosity is, it has totally changed?\\n\\n617\\n01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,700\\nGreat Sizzle, definitely get that mic in their beautiful.\\n\\n618\\n01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,000\\nAnd I am setting it away from me.\\n\\n619\\n01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:35,100\\nNow.\\n\\n620\\n01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:41,200\\nWe're going to cook that steak for about a minute to two minutes on this side and flip it.\\n\\n621\\n01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,400\\nOkay, so get those tongues ready.\\n\\n622\\n01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:52,300\\nNow, this steak is to be prepared, kind of medium rare, which is the best way to enjoy it in my opinion.\\n\\n623\\n01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:52,700\\nNow.\\n\\n624\\n01:07:52,700 --> 01:08:00,400\\nIf you do want to have a medium to, well, steak go ahead and add a minute, to a minute, and a half on that cook time on each of these sides.\\n\\n625\\n01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:00,800\\nOkay.\\n\\n626\\n01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,600\\nSo, our steak is rolling.\\n\\n627\\n01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,600\\nWhich means we're about ready for our Carnitas.\\n\\n628\\n01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:21,399\\nNow, we left our Carnitas in this nice Flat state because we want all this surface area to caramelize this layer of Carnitas before we really begin to represent Italians.\\n\\n629\\n01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:24,899\\nYeah, then, you know, sorry reading the chat.\\n\\n630\\n01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:30,200\\nWe want this surface area to carmelites and really fry in its own fat.\\n\\n631\\n01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,100\\nSo going to remove that plastic.\\n\\n632\\n01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:37,300\\nBack to my pan, viscosity of the oil is beautiful.\\n\\n633\\n01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:41,100\\nIt's going to lay it in there, and I am not even going to touch it.\\n\\n634\\n01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:48,000\\nWe're going to cook that for about two minutes and allow it to really fry and its own rendered fat, okay.\\n\\n635\\n01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,600\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n636\\n01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,500\\nNow Zachary with your mushrooms.\\n\\n637\\n01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,000\\nHere.\\n\\n638\\n01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,899\\nWe can do the same with the pan and getting it, nice and hot.\\n\\n639\\n01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,300\\nAnd then we're really simply just going to saute these bad boys, okay.\\n\\n640\\n01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,100\\nSo sauteing them should hear the sizzle.\\n\\n641\\n01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:18,300\\nOnce the oil is nice and hot, add the mushrooms and then kind of just let them cool out and cook for about a minute before we really begin to stir them.\\n\\n642\\n01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:18,600\\nRight?\\n\\n643\\n01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,100\\nBecause we want that caramelization.\\n\\n644\\n01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,300\\nWe want that color on those mushrooms.\\n\\n645\\n01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:31,300\\nLet us see, any other questions about neutral oil.\\n\\n646\\n01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:31,700\\nNope.\\n\\n647\\n01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,000\\nNeutral oil is just really cheap.\\n\\n648\\n01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,399\\nHonestly, for me personally.\\n\\n649\\n01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,100\\nI use neutral oil for every cooking, pretty much procedure.\\n\\n650\\n01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:49,200\\nAnd that's like I said, it's for like a specific recipe and which I am using olive oil to kind of sweat and embed those onions and baby carrots with some of that olive oil flavor.\\n\\n651\\n01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,100\\nBut yeah grapeseed oil which is the neutral Oil.\\n\\n652\\n01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:56,600\\nWe're using super cheap and it gets better product out of it.\\n\\n653\\n01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:57,000\\nYep.\\n\\n654\\n01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000\\nHigh Point.\\n\\n655\\n01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,800\\nSo, smart used avocado as well.\\n\\n656\\n01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,200\\nThat's also a great neutral oil.\\n\\n657\\n01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:04,900\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n658\\n01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,300\\nSo just showing you guys my stake here.\\n\\n659\\n01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,000\\nIt's been about 2 minutes.\\n\\n660\\n01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,100\\nI am going to go ahead and flip it over.\\n\\n661\\n01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:18,200\\nIt's got this nice dark caramelization on it that dark Amber red.\\n\\n662\\n01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:22,600\\nAnd so another 2 minutes on this side should do the trick.\\n\\n663\\n01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,900\\nAnd then once that two minutes is up directly from my pan.\\n\\n664\\n01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:32,400\\nI am just going to come and rest my steak on my cutting board, right?\\n\\n665\\n01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,300\\nFantastic, so it's been a couple of minutes.\\n\\n666\\n01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:40,800\\nMy Carnitas are quite literally popping off right now, which is a great, great sign.\\n\\n667\\n01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:49,600\\nIf they're popping a little bit too much, you can go ahead and turn down the heat, but let us look at some of this great color.\\n\\n668\\n01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,300\\nWe got.\\n\\n669\\n01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,500\\nYeah, the caramelization definitely happening.\\n\\n670\\n01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:56,200\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n671\\n01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,500\\nGoing to go ahead and mix in that kind of fried.\\n\\n672\\n01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,000\\nConsistent Carnitas.\\n\\n673\\n01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,700\\nLet us take a look at our chicken tinga, beautiful.\\n\\n674\\n01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,100\\nSmall reduce just give it a good stir.\\n\\n675\\n01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,100\\nSo that's been another minute or two on my steak.\\n\\n676\\n01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:26,000\\nSo I am going to go ahead and turn off the heat on my steak going to bring that over to my cutting board.\\n\\n677\\n01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,300\\nLet that thing, rest.\\n\\n678\\n01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,200\\nFor exact Curry's pleasure.\\n\\n679\\n01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:39,900\\nI am going to go ahead and just saute my mushrooms in that cast iron pan.\\n\\n680\\n01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,100\\nIt's got some great color.\\n\\n681\\n01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:47,600\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n682\\n01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,700\\nSo, the mmm does anyone know the importance of letting?\\n\\n683\\n01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,100\\nThe steak rests.\\n\\n684\\n01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,100\\nWhat do you guys think is happening, you know, cooking is so much for me.\\n\\n685\\n01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:05,000\\nI really begun to excel in my career when I began to really observe quite literally what's just happening.\\n\\n686\\n01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,200\\nThis is an applied science in my opinion, which makes this entire, you know, room of your house.\\n\\n687\\n01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:14,600\\nA living laboratory, which makes it so much more fun to really get in the kitchen.\\n\\n688\\n01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,800\\nGet your hands on some ingredients and cook.\\n\\n689\\n01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,700\\nSo let us say yeah, the juices.\\n\\n690\\n01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:23,700\\nExactly.\\n\\n691\\n01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,700\\nSo think about it, right.\\n\\n692\\n01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:29,600\\nWe just expose this meet a lot of heat, which is opening up pores, right?\\n\\n693\\n01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,100\\nLadies.\\n\\n694\\n01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,800\\nAnd I mean my skin routine at nighttime jump out of the shower.\\n\\n695\\n01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:39,100\\nMy pores are freaking size of pepperonis that heat is just expanding them open.\\n\\n696\\n01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,000\\nSo all that poor in the stake.\\n\\n697\\n01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,500\\nHere is expanding, once we take it back to that cold State outside of the pan.\\n\\n698\\n01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,200\\nIt's going to shrivel.\\n\\n699\\n01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,900\\nBack up sucking in all those juices, right?\\n\\n700\\n01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,600\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n701\\n01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,100\\nSo sauteing some mushrooms, getting some great color.\\n\\n702\\n01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,800\\nThese pork carnitas definitely popping, which is great.\\n\\n703\\n01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,300\\nGot some great caramelization.\\n\\n704\\n01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:10,300\\nYou can see all the extra fat that's just been rendered from the pork itself.\\n\\n705\\n01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:19,300\\nI am actually going to go ahead and turn my pan off just because they look nice and golden, but I want these Carnitas to go ahead and just remain in the pan.\\n\\n706\\n01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,400\\nMy chicken tinga looks nice and hot thoroughly all throughout.\\n\\n707\\n01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,500\\nSo, I as well, we will turn that off.\\n\\n708\\n01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:36,000\\nAnd at this point Zach, let us go ahead and probably turn that oven to that broil State just for about a minute or two.\\n\\n709\\n01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:42,800\\nJust to give it a final color on our, our mushroom or excuse me, our carrots, and our sweet potatoes.\\n\\n710\\n01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,100\\nSo let us do that real quick.\\n\\n711\\n01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000\\nPerfect.\\n\\n712\\n01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,700\\nDo a little wipe down at the station.\\n\\n713\\n01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,400\\nNow, our meats are nice and hot.\\n\\n714\\n01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,100\\nThey're beautifully caramelized.\\n\\n715\\n01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,700\\nOur steak is resting.\\n\\n716\\n01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:09,500\\nThe last thing we need to be doing our next thing, we should be doing preparing our tortillas.\\n\\n717\\n01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,500\\nSo through the company to MOA.\\n\\n718\\n01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:23,100\\nWe buy literally about two tons of dried corn every 6 months and this corn comes from different areas, all throughout Mexico.\\n\\n719\\n01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,600\\nAbsolutely, beautiful.\\n\\n720\\n01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:26,800\\nYou will notice here.\\n\\n721\\n01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,000\\nI have these Pink House made Tortillas.\\n\\n722\\n01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:34,400\\nNow the elevation that all of these different pieces of corn.\\n\\n723\\n01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:40,200\\nGrowing really alter the change in the way you cook these tortillas in general.\\n\\n724\\n01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,000\\nSo just taking them out of the bag.\\n\\n725\\n01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:48,300\\nI am going to separate the tortillas from the paper recyclable.\\n\\n726\\n01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,000\\nJust like that.\\n\\n727\\n01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,200\\nWe're letting them breathe.\\n\\n728\\n01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:00,800\\nAnd we already was smart enough to go ahead and turn on our tortilla pan.\\n\\n729\\n01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:05,300\\nSome really warming these things up, should take no time at all.\\n\\n730\\n01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:22,300\\nBeautiful, and just want to mention, I did turn off all of my heat sources on my pans, and I am letting those items stay in the pan just to stay warm until we really hit the plate with them.\\n\\n731\\n01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:22,700\\nOkay.\\n\\n732\\n01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,800\\nSo I have my clean linen here.\\n\\n733\\n01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,200\\nWrong one here.\\n\\n734\\n01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,300\\nIt is beautiful.\\n\\n735\\n01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:34,000\\nSo I am just going to take this over to my workstation are my Kamal.\\n\\n736\\n01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,100\\nI have this beautiful little tiny spatula.\\n\\n737\\n01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:38,700\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\n738\\n01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,100\\nLove it.\\n\\n739\\n01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,400\\nThank you, Central Market.\\n\\n740\\n01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:45,500\\nAnd nice and hot pan already just nice and warm.\\n\\n741\\n01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,000\\nNo oil is needed whatsoever.\\n\\n742\\n01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,700\\nThere's plenty of natural oil in this tortilla.\\n\\n743\\n01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,000\\nNow.\\n\\n744\\n01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,700\\nThe only thing that should ever be in your corn.\\n\\n745\\n01:15:54,700 --> 01:16:00,200\\nTortilla is dried corn, obviously, water and salt.\\n\\n746\\n01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:10,800\\nSo this is a natural gluten-free, you know, vegan option for tacos and it makes the best tacos in the world must be made from fresh.\\n\\n747\\n01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:19,400\\nMassa, I am just going to go ahead and cook these for 30 seconds on each side.\\n\\n748\\n01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,300\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n749\\n01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,400\\nDefinitely have my dog started to come and circle around like a shark.\\n\\n750\\n01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,100\\nShe's psycho.\\n\\n751\\n01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,300\\nShe definitely her favorite.\\n\\n752\\n01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,600\\nTaco is probably the steak carnitas.\\n\\n753\\n01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:38,400\\nYeah.\\n\\n754\\n01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:44,600\\nShe's looking at me like she said and hasn't eaten dinner, but she got well-fed beforehand.\\n\\n755\\n01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:46,900\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n756\\n01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:55,200\\nSo as you can see my tortillas 30 seconds on each side, this is Master Level Kemal work.\\n\\n757\\n01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,100\\nWhen you can do it with your fingertips here.\\n\\n758\\n01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,500\\nAnd like I said, these are already totally cooked for you.\\n\\n759\\n01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,200\\nSo all we got to do is really warm them up.\\n\\n760\\n01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:17,600\\nSo right into my Fresh Linen, it's going to act as a steamer, right?\\n\\n761\\n01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:22,000\\nSo here just going to place my Fresh Tortillas.\\n\\n762\\n01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,300\\nIf they inflate on you.\\n\\n763\\n01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,500\\nThat's just a really amazing great sign that it's a Fresh Tortilla.\\n\\n764\\n01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,200\\nAnd then redo the steps here.\\n\\n765\\n01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,700\\nMake sure you close that linen.\\n\\n766\\n01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:39,700\\nWe want to keep that heat Source inside, right?\\n\\n767\\n01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:47,100\\nDo you guys smell the natural kind of oils being released from these tortillas, as we're cooking?\\n\\n768\\n01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,800\\nIt's kind of like toasting bread, right?\\n\\n769\\n01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,000\\nWe don't necessarily so proud.\\n\\n770\\n01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:52,400\\nJesse.\\n\\n771\\n01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,200\\nI am proud of you.\\n\\n772\\n01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,000\\nIt should be smelling amazing and

that.\\n\\n775\\n01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,800\\nThat Broiler does work fast.\\n\\n776\\n01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,600\\nJust a small amount of color tortillas or coming too long.\\n\\n777\\n01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:14,900\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n778\\n01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:23,000\\nSo add to our pile here, people are start to be coming out of y'all's

a nice plate.\\n\\n782\\n01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,700\\nRemember this presentation is everything.\\n\\n783\\n01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:52,100\\nI mean, how beautiful is it when we just have a nice little blanket of sleeping tortillas like that.\\n\\n784\\n01:18:54,500 --> 01:19:02,500\\nFantastic guys, so close to that final and first bite of heaven.\\n\\n785\\n01:19:03,700 -->

Plate.\\n\\n788\\n01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:10,500\\nNow.\\n\\n789\\n01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:16,800\\nWe have our code, you steak on the counter, aren't on our cutting board here.\\n\\n790\\n01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:20,600\\nLooks nice and delicious.\\n\\n791\\n01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,700\\nYou can see all those beautiful juices being sucked back in.\\n\\n792\\n01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,400\\nNow, you can see the striation of the meat, right?\\n\\n793\\n01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,800\\nAnd here's a pro tip for you guys.\\n\\n794\\n01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,200\\nWe always want to cut our meat against the grain.\\n\\n795\\n01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,200\\nWe don't want to chew with the grain.\\n\\n796\\n01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:38,900\\nWe want our mouth to, you know, cut through the meat itself.\\n\\n797\\n01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:47,000\\nSo find where those long strands of kind of caramelized meet go, and we're going to cut opposite of it.\\n\\n798\\n01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:53,600\\nSo here, I am just cutting nice, beautiful, traditional little fajita ribbons.\\n\\n799\\n01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:59,700\\nThis will be the first item to hit our plate here.\\n\\n800\\n01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,400\\nLike I said, beautiful medium rare.\\n\\n801\\n01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,100\\nAbsolutely beautiful for me.\\n\\n802\\n01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,900\\nI like to just use my knife and kind of hatch.\\n\\n803\\n01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,100\\nStick them like that.\\n\\n804\\n01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,200\\nWe're going to go right in the center.\\n\\n805\\n01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,400\\nOur platter.\\n\\n806\\n01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,000\\nMaybe for you.\\n\\n807\\n01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:20,400\\nZach.\\n\\n808\\n01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:26,700\\nThis is the carrots to match kind of the length, beautiful already.\\n\\n809\\n01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:28,500\\nAnd then next up.\\n\\n810\\n01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,400\\nI am going to go ahead and divide it with my chicken tinga.\\n\\n811\\n01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,000\\nFor having one of these spoons here.\\n\\n812\\n01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,600\\nSuper Saucy.\\n\\n813\\n01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,800\\nThis adobo Chipotle blend.\\n\\n814\\n01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,000\\nThat just coats.\\n\\n815\\n01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,800\\nAll of this chicken just makes it.\\n\\n816\\n01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:52,200\\nAbsolutely amazing smells so good.\\n\\n817\\n01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,100\\nMake sure you get all that sauce from that pan.\\n\\n818\\n01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:03,100\\nAnd I am just going to finish with my absolutely beautiful Carnitas.\\n\\n819\\n01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,200\\nNow, for me.\\n\\n820\\n01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:11,200\\nThe best tool is going to be the tongs because there is a decent amount of that rendered fat still.\\n\\n821\\n01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:14,700\\nSo just give a nice dripping on top of your plate.\\n\\n822\\n01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:17,600\\nOh, yeah.\\n\\n823\\n01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:22,200\\nGuys, I am salivating so bad right now.\\n\\n824\\n01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,600\\nIt's hard for me to talk.\\n\\n825\\n01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:27,500\\nOh Lord.\\n\\n826\\n01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,800\\nThis is unfair that we get to eat this way.\\n\\n827\\n01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,200\\nSeriously guys.\\n\\n828\\n01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,000\\nFluff up some of those herbs.\\n\\n829\\n01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,900\\nLet us get our beautiful platter coming back together.\\n\\n830\\n01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:41,600\\nStrong.\\n\\n831\\n01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,400\\nIntroduce these beautiful Salsas.\\n\\n832\\n01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,400\\nLook at this spread, good Lord.\\n\\n833\\n01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,300\\nHere we have it.\\n\\n834\\n01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,900\\nHe will even get a little Margarita left.\\n\\n835\\n01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:00,700\\nLook at that.\\n\\n836\\n01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:01,700\\nSo guys.\\n\\n837\\n01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:05,600\\nOnce you're at this point, we're going to jump again into another breakout room.\\n\\n838\\n01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,100\\nOf course.\\n\\n839\\n01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,000\\nI want to hear.\\n\\n840\\n01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,100\\nI am going to eat a taco with you guys.\\n\\n841\\n01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,300\\nI want to hear any questions.\\n\\n842\\n01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:11,900\\nYou guys have.\\n\\n843\\n01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,000\\nOh my God, Emily.\\n\\n844\\n01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,500\\nCan we get Emily hired for assembly here?\\n\\n845\\n01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,900\\nI need some help on these events.\\n\\n846\\n01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:22,600\\nAll right, that looks freaking amazing.\\n\\n847\\n01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000\\nShe's got my vote.\\n\\n848\\n01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000\\nBy the way, if there's a winner for this, I am sorry, everyone else.\\n\\n849\\n01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000\\nShe beat ya will to it.\\n\\n850\\n01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,100\\nEmily seems to have won this contest.\\n\\n851\\n01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:37,900\\nAre you food?\\n\\n852\\n01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,800\\nAre you actually like a food stylist on Instagram or something or no?\\n\\n853\\n01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:46,300\\nBut you missed and we all did beyond that.\\n\\n854\\n01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:57,300\\nIt's giving you guys a hard time for not having all the like plating, but I think it turned out.\\n\\n855\\n01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,600\\nI love The Cutting Board.\\n\\n856\\n01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,700\\nIt looks amazing for that Final Touch.\\n\\n857\\n01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:02,500\\nNo, Emily here.\\n\\n858\\n01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,500\\nI want you to do this live with me, right?\\n\\n859\\n01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,400\\nGo ahead and grab them.\\n\\n860\\n01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,400\\nMaldon salt.\\n\\n861\\n01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,400\\nWe sent you yet.\\n\\n862\\n01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,500\\nWe got to get our salt day on.\\n\\n863\\n01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:11,800\\nAll right.\\n\\n864\\n01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:15,600\\nSo maldon, salt is going to be a larger flake salt.\\n\\n865\\n01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,200\\nRight?\\n\\n866\\n01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:24,900\\nSo, the reason we put this on at the very end is because we want to tie in all these intense flavors at the very top-level, right?\\n\\n867\\n01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,000\\nSo when we get that salt just on top.\\n\\n868\\n01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,400\\nOh wait, use your hands.\\n\\n869\\n01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,000\\nThere we go.\\n\\n870\\n01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,300\\nYeah, beautiful.\\n\\n871\\n01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:36,400\\nSo we're always seasoning from above because we want to capture as much surface.\\n\\n872\\n01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,600\\nThis area right as possible.\\n\\n873\\n01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:42,800\\nWe don't want real small pinches of salt, all over the place.\\n\\n874\\n01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:46,000\\nWe want to sporadic almost like a shotgun blast, right?\\n\\n875\\n01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,200\\nAll of that, seasoning, right onto the plate.\\n\\n876\\n01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,000\\nFantastic, everyone do yourself a, get it going on.\\n\\n877\\n01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:52,400\\nAll right.\\n\\n878\\n01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,000\\nAmazing.\\n\\n879\\n01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,600\\nHopefully, it smells great.\\n\\n880\\n01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,700\\nAll these plates are looking fabulous.\\n\\n881\\n01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:13,000\\nFantastic, we're definitely going to have to post some of these on our Instagram and my Instagram is well, I would love that.\\n\\n882\\n01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,100\\nProducer throwing on Instagram in the chat.\\n\\n883\\n01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:27,200\\nHopefully everyone's coming to the fruition of their platter being assembled Zachary house.\\n\\n884\\n01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,800\\nThe house the vegetarian coming along.\\n\\n885\\n01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:41,900\\nShould get some nice color on the butternut squash or excuse me in this, sweet potatoes as carrots should have a nice Grill touch to them as well.\\n\\n886\\n01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,900\\nPerfect out.\\n\\n887\\n01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,000\\nHe's already finished.\\n\\n888\\n01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,800\\nThose mushrooms are, I wish everyone could have those mushrooms.\\n\\n889\\n01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:59,100\\nSo, in the mushroom mixture, we add with called wila coche.\\n\\n890\\n01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:04,600\\nNow, we get this also weekly and this is going to be a raw corn truffle.\\n\\n891\\n01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,300\\nUnfortunately.\\n\\n892\\n01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:13,700\\nWe don't get this raw beautiful product in the States because of our corn being so genetically modified, which is a whole other issue.\\n\\n893\\n01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:17,900\\nThat's the whole thing, but you're able to enjoy that real authentic.\\n\\n894\\n01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:22,000\\nFresh probably a new ingredient that you have been having fourth, which is amazing.\\n\\n895\\n01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:25,700\\nMan, all right.\\n\\n896\\n01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:26,900\\nI am a dive in on a Taco.\\n\\n897\\n01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,300\\nThis is been staring at me too much.\\n\\n898\\n01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:32,000\\nWhat's the consensus?\\n\\n899\\n01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:32,600\\nWhat is everyone?\\n\\n900\\n01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,500\\nStarting with carnitas steak Tanga?\\n\\n901\\n01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,200\\nLet us see what they got going on.\\n\\n902\\n01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,300\\nI think I might I am just it's probably eating right now.\\n\\n903\\n01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,700\\nSo they can't take things in, right?\\n\\n904\\n01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,400\\nThat's fair.\\n\\n905\\n01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,500\\nEveryone's Max are going to be all greased up.\\n\\n906\\n01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,100\\nYeah, right.\\n\\n907\\n01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,800\\nWow, Lee.\\n\\n908\\n01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,600\\nThat's a gorgeous plate.\\n\\n909\\n01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,300\\nLook at that.\\n\\n910\\n01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,100\\nAndrew.\\n\\n911\\n01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,700\\nVery nice.\\n\\n912\\n01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,600\\nJesse beautiful, man.\\n\\n913\\n01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,600\\nThese plates are gorgeous.\\n\\n914\\n01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,700\\nSo let us start dropping in some questions.\\n\\n915\\n01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:12,400\\nWe have got a few questions here in QA with Linda's.\\n\\n916\\n01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,500\\nFirst question.\\n\\n917\\n01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:18,700\\nOkay, Chef, what is neutral oil?\\n\\n918\\n01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:26,600\\nYeah, so neutral oil, as we said before, is a neutral oil.\\n\\n919\\n01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,600\\nIt doesn't have a very Bold Flavor like olive oil does, right?\\n\\n920\\n01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,800\\nBecause olive oil is made of Olives.\\n\\n921\\n01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:45,100\\nIt tastes like all this neutral oil is just kind of plain Bland Flavor now, I don't want to say Bland and a negative term because to me, it does technically have a flavor for instance.\\n\\n922\\n01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:50,400\\nI use it to pop popcorn and I really love the flavor of grapeseed on my popcorn.\\n\\n923\\n01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,300\\nWhich I guess I am just weird about that.\\n\\n924\\n01:26:52,300 --> 01:27:12,900\\nI am not sure but this oil allows you to heat up your pan a little higher than other oils, like olive oil allowing you to get a better texture on your food without burning that oil which could potentially, you know contaminate and make your food taste a little bitter, you know an onslaught of things.\\n\\n925\\n01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,000\\nGood question though.\\n\\n926\\n01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:14,900\\nGotcha.\\n\\n927\\n01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:20,300\\nSo is are there particular oils that are considered neutral?\\n\\n928\\n01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:44,900\\nYeah, so I use grape seed oil, grapeseed oil is my favorite oil to use for cooking when it comes to sauteing our, you know, like shallow frying, something olive oil more, so for salad dressings, or finishing a pasta, so you're not, you know, really abusing the oil on its temperature, but we're actually using it for the flavor of the oil itself.\\n\\n929\\n01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:58,900\\nAnd then of course, like shortening for frying, even higher smoke point, so, Able to you know, fry things at 400 degrees getting that super text crispy texture on wings, you know, tater tots things like that.\\n\\n930\\n01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:03,700\\nIs canola oil, considered neutral and was Askin?\\n\\n931\\n01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,300\\nYes, technically I use canola more.\\n\\n932\\n01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:12,500\\nSo for frying, just because it does have a higher caloric intake, right?\\n\\n933\\n01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:16,700\\nAnd if you're frying, something like might as well just take it all.\\n\\n934\\n01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:17,100\\nAnyway.\\n\\n935\\n01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:23,200\\nSo yeah, I use canola a little bit more for frying, really, really love grape seed.\\n\\n936\\n01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:26,900\\nOil for my main use of personal cooking.\\n\\n937\\n01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:28,700\\nGood to note.\\n\\n938\\n01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,400\\nAll right, we got a question from Ali.\\n\\n939\\n01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:36,000\\nCould you remind us which toppings are supposed to pair with, which proteins?\\n\\n940\\n01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:44,700\\nEvery year, every topping goes with all of these proteins, honestly, we're inviting you to kind of figure out your own blend, right?\\n\\n941\\n01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:58,700\\nSo for me, as you can see, I really love the salsa verde with the Carnitas and just avocado, but that's not to say that you shouldn't try the salsa verde with the chicken and, you know, carrots.\\n\\n942\\n01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,900\\nIt's all really just for you to explore.\\n\\n943\\n01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:05,000\\nWe give you a decent amount of these tortillas.\\n\\n944\\n01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,100\\nSo you're really having a full deck to play.\\n\\n945\\n01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,500\\nBut yeah, just figure out what your favorite combination.\\n\\n946\\n01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:11,400\\nLike.\\n\\n947\\n01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:17,300\\nI love the steak and the SHINee Peck together, but that's not technically the exact way.\\n\\n948\\n01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:18,900\\nWe encourage you guys to eat it.\\n\\n949\\n01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:25,000\\nSo play along, feel free to dive in on different garnishes until you figure out your favorite.\\n\\n950\\n01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,800\\nAnother question here from Danielle.\\n\\n951\\n01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,800\\nDo you prefer a flavored Marg or a classic?\\n\\n952\\n01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,900\\nA flavored.\\n\\n953\\n01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:36,300\\nYeah.\\n\\n954\\n01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,800\\nHere in Austin, Texas.\\n\\n955\\n01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,900\\nI feel like I live on that Tex-Mex aisle off South First Street

01:32:06,000\\nYeah, so that in particular the bundle that we do send you is just a field medley of herbs.\\n\\n1004\\n01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:14,400\\nBut that one in your hand was a Malabar spinach leaf lettuce.\\n\\n1005\\n01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,300\\nGot more kids coming on my side.\\n\\n1006\\n01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:23,100\\nSo you will start hearing some kids screaming, but I am going to top this off with some salsa.\\n\\n1007\\n01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:24,900\\nLove it.\\n\\n1008\\n01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,000\\nNice.\\n\\n1009\\n01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:28,100\\nThat sounds like my taco.\\n\\n1010\\n01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,100\\nCheers.\\n\\n1011\\n01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:34,800\\nCheers Alexis, so how's it going with plating?\\n\\n1012\\n01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:40,100\\nI mean, you're just diving right in the drink.\\n\\n1013\\n01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,200\\nI didn't know the artistic plate was part of it.\\n\\n1014\\n01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:55,700\\nI was like very much building, right into a taco in my mouth, kudos to all providers out there.\\n\\n1015\\n01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:56,800\\nThat wasn't me.\\n\\n1016\\n01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,100\\nWhat's yours do you

01:33:06,400\\nYeah, take me off.\\n\\n1020\\n01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,900\\nI don't want to see me anymore.\\n\\n1021\\n01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:09,900\\nYou're welcome.\\n\\n1022\\n01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:10,500\\nToday.\\n\\n1023\\n01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:13,600\\nWe're all just hang it right through Andrew.\\n\\n1024\\n01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,000\\nThank you Chef.\\n\\n1025\\n01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:15,800\\nThat was wonderful.\\n\\n1026\\n01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,300\\nThank you.\\n\\n1027\\n01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,200\\nI would love to ask.\\n\\n1028\\n01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,800\\nWhat's everyone's favorite.\\n\\n1029\\n01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:22,200\\nSalsa.\\n\\n1030\\n01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:27,400\\nYou guys lean towards the Verde like myself, or do you like this month pregnancy or bit more?\\n\\n1031\\n01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,400\\nThe answer is yes, Emily.\\n\\n1032\\n01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:32,600\\nYou have a fourth Taco.\\n\\n1033\\n01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:33,700\\nMaybe even if it.\\n\\n1034\\n01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,100\\nAll right, I gotta say, my favorite.\\n\\n1035\\n01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:45,900\\nI think out of the three meats, I have here, the fork with the soft rubber dogs.\\n\\n1036\\n01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,700\\nYeah, it's clutch.\\n\\n1037\\n01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:51,300\\nShelby boy, gets it.\\n\\n1038\\n01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:53,400\\nI really eat.\\n\\n1039\\n01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:54,800\\nOne of the meat straight up.\\n\\n1040\\n01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,400\\nProbably go for the steak.\\n\\n1041\\n01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:03,300\\nBut when you put the toppings with the Carnitas, that's the best.\\n\\n1042\\n01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,000\\nIt's a magical feeling.\\n\\n1043\\n01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,200\\nIt's a Magical pair.\\n\\n1044\\n01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:10,300\\nThat's what we're here for, right?\\n\\n1045\\n01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:13,800\\nI felt all my good brain controls released.\\n\\n1046\\n01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:22,600\\nOnce I get into that when we got to feed the Sous chefs to, so make sure you feed your for making some shots.\\n\\n1047\\n01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:42,600\\nSwallows it, they do the sweeping, you know, they have come through and especially my line in my kitchen is always nice and clean my little Hoover vacuum suit sous-chef over here.\\n\\n1048\\n01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,300\\nKeeps it tight.\\n\\n1049\\n01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:49,100\\nYeah, whenever she's not around, they drop something on the floor.\\n\\n1050\\n01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:51,400\\nWhat do I do now?\\n\\n1051\\n01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,100\\nI know it's like, so I do I have to pick this up?\\n\\n1052\\n01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:54,900\\nThis is not fair.\\n\\n1053\\n01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:58,000\\nStarting work, Chef.\\n\\n1054\\n01:34:58,300 --> 01:34:59,000\\nGreat job.\\n\\n1055\\n01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:00,200\\nGreat job.\\n\\n1056\\n01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:13,800\\nAll right, so we're going to move to lounge and Continue the remainder of this time together and lounges are there.\\n\\n1057\\n01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,200\\nAny final thoughts?\\n\\n1058\\n01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:28,100\\nChef that you have for us any like tips, best practices, a Twitter, quote, anything, keep those fingertips tucked in?\\n\\n1059\\n01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:28,700\\nAll right.\\n\\n1060\\n01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,200\\nNext time I see you guys.\\n\\n1061\\n01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:33,000\\nI better see all everyone with 10 fingers.\\n\\n1062\\n01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:34,300\\nKeep on cooking.\\n\\n1063\\n01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:39,100\\nIt's, you know your own expression, and we're here to eat.\\n\\n1064\\n01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:40,400\\nSo Enjoy the food, guys.\\n\\n1065\\n01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,600\\nIt was really such a pleasure cooking with all of you.\\n\\n1066\\n01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:44,700\\nI am looking forward to the next one.\\n\\n1067\\n01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:45,700\\nSo I will see you then.\\n\\n1068\\n01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:47,800\\nThank you, everyone.\\n\\n1069\\n01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,200\\nEnjoy your food idea.\\n\\n1070\\n01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:09,600\\nWe grow primarily Greens on here and I wanted to have more land because gardening was a hobby that got out of control.\\n\\n1071\\n01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,200\\nSo we practice permaculture principles out here.\\n\\n1072\\n01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:21,100\\nThe way you can Define permaculture is that get is a way to design an ecosystem that is beneficial to plan.\\n\\n1073\\n01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,700\\nSoil and humans.\\n\\n1074\\n01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:28,100\\nOne of our primary missions is to lead the land in better shape than when we found it.\\n\\n1075\\n01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,800\\nA lot of farms, don't practice that we have these tunnels.\\n\\n1076\\n01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,100\\nWe have hundred-foot tunnels.\\n\\n1077\\n01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:36,600\\nWe have five of them on our farm right now, and they are great.\\n\\n1078\\n01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,200\\nProtectors from extreme weather star Greenhouse.\\n\\n1079\\n01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:50,100\\nAnd then we transplant by hand, all of these letters, heads that we have grown in our Greenhouse from seed.\\n\\n1080\\n01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,500\\nSo, everything we grow here, we have grown ourselves.\\n\\n1081\\n01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:57,200\\nI love, love, love growing lettuce.\\n\\n1082\\n01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:07,900\\nWhat you'd be enjoying at your event or lettuce is from this bed and most likely this bed for the folks who are going to be part of this event.\\n\\n1083\\n01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,100\\nI think you're going to really like this lettuce.\\n\\n1084\\n01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:18,300\\nOne of the things that I really love about Austin is how food-centric it is.\\n\\n1085\\n01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:22,900\\nSo many great restaurants in Austin by local and local farms.\\n\\n1086\\n01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,900\\nThere's a really nice healthy diversity of farms.\\n\\n1087\\n01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:34,800\\nAnd that wouldn't exist if restaurants and school districts, grocery stores, weren't supporting those local farms.\\n\\n1088\\n01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:41,300\\nThe more you keep your money local, the more you're growing the economy and the more you're Growing the future health of your own community.\\n\\n1089\\n01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:44,500\\nAnd that's, it's great to see, Austin.\\n\\n1090\\n01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,300\\nNot only talk that talk.\\n\\n1091\\n01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,400\\nI really walk that walk.\\n\\n1092\\n01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,500\\nShe knows what's coming.\\n\", doc_id=None, embedding=None, extra_info={'webinar_name':
