We're bringing all the stuff.

32
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:29,400
It's such a timely topic, is what I have been spending so much my own time thinking about both internally at lattice and then you're also working with our customers and folks, in the industry.

33
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,300
Yeah.

34
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,600
Yeah.

35
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Well, thank you for making time.

36
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,000
I know that we linked up a couple weeks ago about this event and you were like, right on, let us get after it.

37
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,900
And we were just riffing.

38
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,600
And so this is going to be a lot of that, that conversation.

39
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,600
We're going to be pulling out like, what are we learning?

40
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:53,500
You know, in the space and you guys being on the front lines of driving Employee Engagement as a company.

41
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,900
I know that you guys are investing a lot of work.

42
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:03,300
Not just to enable and equipped the industry and leaders, but also internally, right for your organization.

43
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,200
And so would love to cover both of those sides.

44
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,800
I will before we do that though.

45
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,400
Let us go ahead and bring that pole on stage about the favorite holiday, drink looks like hot.

46
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Chocolate is the winner here.

47
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,000
Dave.

48
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,400
What would you have voted here?

49
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,300
I voted for eggnog.

50
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,400
I am for me.

51
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,000
It's like not.

52
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,300
I feel like I can get hot chocolate.

53
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,700
Any time of the year, but eggnog.

54
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,300
That's right.

55
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,100
This is true.

56
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,400
This is true is funny because I have my warm drink here.

57
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,700
It looks like Starbucks.

58
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,800
Skip Thanksgiving and went straight to Christmas, but my vote here and it looks like it's starting to Trend up go.

59
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,500
Keitel is coming right behind egg.

60
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,400
Not I am in Puerto Rico right now.

61
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,700
Uncle Keitel is a Puerto Rican, coconut.

62
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,900
Nog, and it's fantastic and it has a little bit of spice in it.

63
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,900
That gets you sort of ready for the holiday conversations as well.

64
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,300
So if you haven't tried that, go ahead and give that a shot.

65
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,800
My team was laughing at me because I have never had hot toddy.

66
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Now is s in my alone in that Dave.

67
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,100
Do you know what hot toddy is?

68
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,500
I feel like I have had it.

69
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
I can't remember.

70
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,600
Where is it sort of like a mulled wine or like a mule or something?

71
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,000
I have, I have no idea, but folks would have to educate Us in chat at some point, but it's not.

72
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,000
I am gonna have to try it.

73
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,500
I am at the try.

74
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,000
So, I will try hot toddy.

75
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,500
You guys try coquito this holiday season, and I think we will be good to go.

76
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,800
Alright, alright, so now, pull number two.

77
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,500
Let us bring phone number two on stage.

78
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,200
This one's actually going to help us drive conversation here.

79
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,900
So what is for the audience?

80
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:51,300
What is your biggest priority right now, when it comes to employees and there's a lot of different things here, right?

81
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,200
Employee Engagement is a retention.

82
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,700
Is it Talent acquisition?

83
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,500
Is it d?

84
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,000
E and I am belonging.

85
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:04,800
Is it Learning and Development go ahead and place your vote by clicking directly on the stage because this is going to help guide the conversation, right?

86
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:14,300
Dave you and I can go into a lot of these different Pockets, but it's important that we actually speak to what people are looking for here as well.

87
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,100
Okay.

88
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,300
All right.

89
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,600
Looks like Employee Engagement is the front-runner here?

90
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,700
And, you know, under Employee Engagement like Dave.

91
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,100
Okay, you help us understand that, right?

92
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:34,600
From a lattice perspective, Employee Engagement seems to have its, there's a lot of things that go underneath that.

93
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,700
How would you, how do you define Employee Engagement from a lattice perspective just to level set the conversation?

94
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,600
Yeah.

95
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:54,100
I mean, I think fundamentally I think about engagement as Being defined our, how much are people committed to staying at the company and really willing to give everything.

96
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,700
They have to the group effort.

97
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,200
But how does that created through a whole range of things?

98
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,400
I think belonging is at the center of it, and we have seen that in the data over time.

99
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:13,500
I have seen it both at the companies that I have worked at, and we look at customers and work with them.

100
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:24,000
Someone's, like, Just fundamental understanding of hey, is this a place where I am part of the team where I have a future is just core driver of that.

101
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,300
Yeah.

102
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,900
Yeah, you know, I resonate with so much of that, you know, leading the charge here.

103
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:44,700
Welcome top of mind for me is, you know, our people, we treat our people, good to help us, hit the milestones, we need as an organization, but it's a hard thing to do to really know the heartbeat of your people.

104
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:44,900
Whoa.

105
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,900
Quarter by quarter week by week, especially in this, in this current sort of situation that were in today.

106
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,500
Where, you know, like we're all like from a society perspective.

107
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,800
We have been hit hard over the last two years, and we're learning new ways of working.

108
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,700
We're trying to navigate, you know, all these different things.

109
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:16,700
And, so I would imagine even lattice as a company is supporting companies in very tangible Ways by the tools and such that you offer.

110
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,600
You know, not, I don't want to make this infomercial, but I do know the power behind the platform because it's amazing.

111
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
So, yeah, thank you for leading the charge there, on that front.

112
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:35,000
But yeah, what's your when you think about the conditions of Employee Engagement given to certain landscape that were in today?

113
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:46,500
However, you saw the shift and leaders before covet and now during and going to post, covid-19 been the shift there on the investment, on employee engagement.

114
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,800
Ain't ya.

115
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,900
So it's I think definitely really top of mind and I think we have seen it in our own recent surveys.

116
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:03,200
How much it shot up the priority, you know stack ranking of for HR leaders.

117
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,800
I think you know, you go back obviously to a year ago.

118
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:16,900
Everyone was thinking about just even job stability and how do I how to whether through this downturn and recession and it's obviously changed.

119
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,100
Changed huge amount.

120
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:26,000
I think we have seen things shift from pre covid environment, which is also really pretty hot labor market.

121
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:42,600
One is that everyone is figuring out their hybrid model and as much as we're to all talking about attrition right now and the risk of it, like there's a lot of companies that when they have their final actual.

122
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,100
Okay.

123
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:50,800
Now you're supposed to return to the office date whether that's At the end of this year or, you know, various companies have kept pushing it out.

124
00:15:51,300 --> 00:16:01,000
It's La, I think a real Reckoning as some of those approaches that are lower on the flexibility Spectrum.

125
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,500
We're going to are going to run into reality.

126
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:11,600
And so there's going to be also a whole I think wave of attrition that comes out of that for companies to yeah, no doubt.

127
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,100
No doubt, you know, this was interesting and it's just a fascinating time.

128
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,400
We're in, we're from Work.

129
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:24,800
It's been normalized over the last 18 months because we have seen the world continue and still give people the flexibility.

130
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,400
They were looking for to live where they love and love where they live and vice versa and still get the job done.

131
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:39,100
And, so I agree is going to be really interesting to see, you know, the next couple of years as companies are grappling with the right policy, the right flexibility.

132
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:51,400
And we're going to get into that because I know that you guys have are going through that yourself, and we have our own perspective as well, and we will Dive In Before we do that, let us go ahead and talk about the state of people report.

133
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,900
You know, you guys put together a survey and you serve it over 700 HR professionals, right?

134
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:03,900
Click at 2021 Rapport and it offers a lot of different insights what?

135
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,900
We're going to be pulling some of those insights on to the stage to help anchor and inform Us in the conversation.

136
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,700
Me included.

137
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,700
I selfishly in love these conversations guy.

138
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,400
Get to learn from some of the best people, right?

139
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,800
And the findings that they have.

140
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,300
So let us go ahead and bring one of those stats on stage.

141
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,900
It's shows.

142
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,500
Absolutely.

143
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah, one of the biggest perks of becoming a lattice employee for me was getting early access to the results coming out of these surveys.

144
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's been so helpful communion and doing my own 2020 planning, 2022 planning.

145
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,900
Yeah, no doubt.

146
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,100
So let us bring some of those insights to the stage, so we can actually have a conversation around it.

147
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:52,400
You know, it seems like more than half of respondents saw an it's in the poori departures over the last few months and it's tea and up a little bit of what you're saying.

148
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,100
Right.

149
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,000
Which is policies are starting to be rolled out.

150
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,100
People have changed human behavior change the way they do things.

151
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,800
Like for me personally.

152
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
I have a little girl.

153
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,600
She's she just turned to.

154
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,200
I saw her grow up throughout this pandemic.

155
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,700
Like I am here in the office and then I can go and see her first step.

156
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Those things.

157
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,800
You can't put a value on and it's going to be interesting to see how these things continue to.

158
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,700
You to drive forward now.

159
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:28,000
What do you think is the main cause for folksy and his level of quote-unquote?

160
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,300
Greg's resignation now as opposed, to when the formal policies come out?

161
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,000
Do you feel like some of these policies are starting to hit some of these companies now, and people are reacting to that?

162
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I think that's one aspect of it for sure.

163
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,400
I think that there's an interesting mix, both of some like, real enduring factors.

164
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:58,200
Like we look at it and a lot of the drivers come back down to things that we know are really important.

165
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,400
What's my career development?

166
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,100
Like whose my manager?

167
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,700
What sort of connections do I have with, with my co-workers?

168
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,700
So there's a whole range of things that are actually.

169
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:17,400
We really consistent from what we would have seen 12 or call, you know, 24 months ago.

170
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,600
I think what's new is and I think you spoke to it there.

171
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:22,900
Right?

172
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:32,800
Like you have had this like really personal experience with your family and how that's affected you.

173
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,500
I have gone through some things like that.

174
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:43,900
Myself just being able to spend some time with a couple of parents who are getting older that you know, maybe pre covid.

175
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:51,300
I wouldn't have been able to spend so much time with people are we considering a lot of Life priorities?

176
00:19:51,300 --> 00:20:01,900
And so that's shifting how much Focus people are putting on sort of holistic wellness, and how am I feeling supported and how companies that respond that?

177
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,100
No doubt, no doubt and just being remote.

178
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,400
It makes things a little bit more complicated, right?

179
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,300
As a leader.

180
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:22,200
You're not really getting the face of face, the walk around the office, and kind of see that this person that was always eating in this area is no longer there.

181
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,500
So you want to just check up on that individual.

182
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:30,700
A lot of that goes unseen, which means that we have to be even more intentional, right?

183
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,300
As leaders.

184
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:36,100
And as companies to Car people write the perks of, you know what?

185
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,900
I was back at Google.

186
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:43,700
The Perks of like the massage table or the snacks and the micro kitchen, or the scooters to like, get around.

187
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:50,600
The campus are no longer going to be the things that keep your people hooked into the company.

188
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:59,900
What are you seeing, like, even in the early stages of companies and what they're trying to do to invest and their culture remotely.

189
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,000
Yeah.

190
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,100
It's been something that we have fermented with a lot.

191
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:13,600
I think that it's impossible to go into this and just know exactly how it's supposed to be done and how it will work best in your own company.

192
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:24,700
I think the thing is that I am seeing one is just getting away from just really generic virtual happy hour, big, big group and figuring out.

193
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,400
How do you get participation?

194
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,100
Either it in that larger setting internally.

195
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,100
We are all about the chat and being really Lively and active.

196
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:43,600
They're breaking out in small groups, mixing, different ways of engaging and then how do you break it down?

197
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:57,600
So at one point you just said, I look, we are done with virtual happy hours, just basically like ban them and let us to take all of that energy and invest it in creating.

198
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,900
Small group events for teams and cross-functional partners.

199
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:08,000
And let us get 5 or 10 people together and do a really cool event for them, where they can, they can engage with, with each other.

200
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,400
Mmm.

201
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:16,300
So, I think those are the, those are the things that we have had great reaction on and get people dancing.

202
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:16,800
Yeah.

203
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,700
That she has to, like, actually build a connection with each other.

204
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,600
Yeah, now, I love that.

205
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,500
I love that and date.

206
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,400
I promise, guys.

207
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:36,400
I did not pay Dave to say that we are, you know, for us, that's what we drive, you know, welcome drives these different type of experiences vary, whether its high production like this or small groups who are wood and what have you.

208
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:49,900
And what we're seeing just to speak on, like the patterns that we're seeing on our side, we're seeing exactly that right companies are saying that, you know, the things that we're first, first of all, we have taken this approach.

209
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,200
Where will use to do in the room like, in office in person environment?

210
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,300
We're trying to replicate that in the virtual environment.

211
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:06,200
And that's where we get in trouble versus saying, you know what, we're going to take a remote first approach and say what is really an engaging experience.

212
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:13,100
Is it really just bringing people into a gallery of all of our faces from meeting to meeting immediately meeting?

213
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:19,700
And then we're going to try to inject an experience or do we take a remote first approach and say You know what?

214
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:33,100
We're going to actually change it up quite a bit and do things that were not even possible to do in the real world because now we're in the, in the remote world, and we can do things that were not possible.

215
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,800
Easy for some companies to get you, get caught on the wrong side of this, to where it was getting me.

216
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:49,000
A lot of companies who are trying to add in a little bit of flexibility and one or two days a week from home or a couple of remote people and our understanding.

217
00:23:49,100 --> 00:24:15,500
Are estimating, still what that means when you put it all together, when you have 10% remote and a bunch of other people that you will still need to be operating with much at different norms, and communication Styles and ways of engaging because you will come into the office, even though you think that you're mostly in office and you're going to have half the people dialing in.

218
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,800
And so it's just going to drive a lot of different engagement there.

219
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:27,400
No doubt and that's sort of like drives a good segue into like a remote and hybrid work challenges, right?

220
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
I think that.

221
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,900
I mean, you're starting to peel back.

222
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:36,900
What could be like an entire for our conversations, and we can make turned it into a conference to talk about the learnings.

223
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:45,900
But really, that's what it is, is really learning and iterating, you know, in our conversation before we came on stage.

224
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:54,600
We're talking about how lattice had a plan and say, you know what, After certain amount of months, we're going to bring people back to the office and then this and then Delta came.

225
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,700
And then what were some of those learnings for you?

226
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,900
I mean, you're sitting, you're sitting with leaders at ladders, you're saying, okay, like let us figure this out.

227
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,500
Let us roll it out.

228
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,600
But what's the power of iteration and learning in that?

229
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,500
Oh, yeah.

230
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,500
We had the perfect plan.

231
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:24,500
It was, it was all, it was all baked out, and we had the, we had the five-page FAQ Dock, and it was all very Like well organized, it was all going to be our people come in on these days.

232
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,900
And this is what it's going to look like.

233
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,600
We rolled it out before any of us actually set foot in the office again.

234
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,200
And as soon as we did, I mean, even all of us who debated it and written it up.

235
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Like, I don't know.

236
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,500
I feel different about some of this stuff than I thought.

237
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:42,900
I would.

238
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:49,400
Like, I thought I was a really want this person and actually turns out I want more flexibility or these challenges.

239
00:25:49,500 --> 00:26:00,700
We thought that the one that always comes to mind is we have no meeting Wednesdays and yeah, so we And this out and Wednesday, we're going to do two days at home.

240
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,500
Wednesday was going to be one of those days.

241
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,600
So everyone could do the focus work.

242
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,600
It turned out.

243
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:18,500
It was the complete opposite as soon as we opened up the office, optimally, everyone came in Wednesday's because they didn't have meetings, and they wanted to actually be able to engage with each other and that made total sense expensive.

244
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:28,300
But It was the come on, what we thought and then Delta came and the combination of those things.

245
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:38,400
I think we have been doing a lot of real-time surveying like rolling pulse engagement surveys and Delta hit the next week on.

246
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,400
We had a question around like I agree with my company's approach.

247
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,400
On, on some hybrid related things.

248
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:55,300
We saw it felt fall 30 points in a week after Delta really, really took shape there and wow.

249
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,700
It was the dinner for us to say.

250
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,800
All right, we gotta do this over.

251
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,100
We came our and said, hey, we did this too early.

252
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:10,000
So we're going to put everything back on the table, and we're gonna, we're going to bring you along on the journey with us.

253
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,400
We're not going to, we won't have the 10-page, FAQ doc, ready.

254
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,000
And so know that there's going to be uncertainty but it's not.

255
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,600
Is right now hiding it like there're just things we don't know yet.

256
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:31,200
And here's how we're going to go through this Wireless together and that really, I think you built those with people and helped us help.

257
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,100
Just kind of bring people Along on that on the journey with us.

258
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Now Dave what do you think like lattice folks in general?

259
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,300
Are you guys going to see folks?

260
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:50,300
I stay remote or you guys always going to require two days or where's the current thinking that way right now?

261
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:04,900
Yeah, and I think everyone says they're you know, doing or so many people say they're doing hybrid and the no never defines what that is and you really do have to break it down to in the what's hybrid.

262
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:15,500
Of your in commuting distance of the office and you're coming in sometimes and not coming in sometimes and then what's remote.

263
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,500
And you know, and your part of a bigger organization that isn't necessarily all remote.

264
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:34,800
The way we are approaching it now is really trying to get often down more to the team by team level and allowing for a fair amount of flexibility in individual.

265
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:46,300
Um, so take like our engineering organization and our Tech teams, they will have a pod that is focused on this part of the product that will be default.

266
00:28:46,300 --> 00:29:02,800
Remote, people know if the joining that pod that team operates with total like remote first, mindset and norms, and they will be another pod that, hey, it's people, that actually like that, that office collaboration, and they will come in one or two days a week and be within commuting distance.

267
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,900
The thing that we were figuring out now.

268
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:15,100
Next is when and how do we do the virtual events in a way that's engaging for a hybrid team?

269
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,000
And when and how do we bring people together in person?

270
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:28,700
We're talking about both a like january/february big virtual kickoff and then also possibly bring all of the company together.

271
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:34,900
Like once in person later in the yeah really, you know, some of the in-person connection.

272
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:57,300
It's, you know, was mind-boggling day is that, who would have thought 24 months ago that every company across the world is thinking about these things and that remote is normalized and that people can work from home and companies are like, yeah, maybe you can just come to the office once a week.

273
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,100
Like, it's a complete s***, 24 months later.

274
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,900
We're living in a place where we're putting employees first, and we're saying that.

275
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,500
You know what, we can still get the job done, and we want to have flexibility.

276
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,900
But we also want these kind of things.

277
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,400
Now, these kind of things are the things that feel that are still evolving.

278
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:22,300
And we're learning from a business perspective, what they are and the example that you had, which was fantastic.

279
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:29,400
People came into to actually build connection with other peers on that Wednesday as opposed to a no meeting.

280
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,800
And it seems like that's a pattern that companies are taking where when folks do come together.

281
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,900
We want them to connect in ways that you can't do over screen.

282
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,300
And so for us, for instance, we gathered our entire company in person, and we focused on doing no screen time.

283
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,500
It was a couple days, and we said no screen time.

284
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,900
We're actually going to do things that are almost impossible to do remotely and build that relational Equity.

285
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,400
So that when we jump back on here, I am connected to date.

286
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,900
Because Dave and I we broke bread and I got to know him his story.

287
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:14,600
Re and we went on a walk and talk and it felt right and I think that's a pattern that we're seeing also company sake is that resonate with what you're seeing?

288
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,500
Definitely that I think getting much more intentional around?

289
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
What do we want to use this time?

290
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,600
Whether that's the in-person time or the virtual time?

291
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,400
What do we want to use it for?

292
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,800
And there is actually there's really good research that backs up exactly what you're saying.

293
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,900
A virtual team actually perform.

294
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,300
Much more highly.

295
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:47,000
If they have been able to meet even once in person and been able to go through some of that relationship building that they might not have been able to.

296
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:56,500
Otherwise, the other thing we're seeing and I spawned the chat, someone mentioned across functional scavenger hunt that they set up the cross.

297
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,100
Functional piece is really interesting.

298
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:30,000
There was actually there was a study that Microsoft actually just did and released in nature, they analyzed all of the like Communications and meetings that were happening when people went into a remote or hybrid in environment, what they found is that the total amount of communication stayed the same but it tended towards being much more within the team with a decline of lots of cross functional connections and communication.

299
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,600
It was something that we saw internally or even myself when I joined I am boarded in June.

300
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:55,800
So I was onboarding remotely as we're all still figuring it out now, and I am actually surprised how easily I could connect with other execs with, with my team with folks that I had the opportunity to work with a lot and repeatedly.

301
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:04,400
And when I realized I was missing is like hey that person that I don't have a specific reason to talk to, but maybe I would admit it.

302
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,300
The lunch table, right?

303
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:12,900
And like that's our bill is sort of cross-functional empathy, you know, somewhere else in the organization.

304
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,400
That's what's breaking down.

305
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,900
Yeah, and that's it.

306
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,900
I think, I think that's right.

307
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:38,000
I think that's a challenge even for us right at, welcome to we're 100% remote food to distribute it and I think it's those opportunities to see a new employee that, you know, joined two weeks ago and See him her walking down the hall and you're like, hey, you know what?

308
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,800
Let us have five minutes right now.

309
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,700
Let us just catch up and I want to hear your story.

310
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,800
And how was your week going?

311
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,300
And let us go for a coffee.

312
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:46,800
Right?

313
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,300
I think that those are the things that we have to figure out pretty quickly.

314
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,800
To continue to build that.

315
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:59,600
Every lease from Equity, that drives us segueing into creating a culture of belonging, right?

316
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,400
You T that up how important that is on the retention side?

317
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:19,400
How people would have feel Connected to not just a company but their co-workers we have a stat here from the report that says 43% of HR professionals here at that Employee Engagement was the number one top priority over the next 12 months.

318
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,800
It's true with like the folks that we surveyed here at this event as well.

319
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,100
It's like the top priority for folks.

320
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:33,199
Like how are you seeing folks boost retention in the current landscape, right?

321
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,400
We have this complexity of Figuring out hybrid and strategies.

322
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,199
What are you seeing some actual things that you are actually working?

323
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,500
Are you starting to see some patterns from this report?

324
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,199
And from your peers in the space?

325
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,300
Yeah.

326
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:55,500
So I think one of the big patterns is happening, I think there's a, there's been a real shift.

327
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:07,800
Unfortunately over the last six to nine months, of a lot of companies really actually D prioritizing d&i, and that was one of the changes that we saw between or last year's survey.

328
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:34,900
In this year's survey was, you know, I am falling really far down the agenda, both your business and HR leaders and I think that when you dig below a lot of times a headline stats around engagement and attrition what you realize underneath people having really different experiences and you know, like this is its something that I try and keep really like Forefront in my mind.

329
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:49,200
A white male, like I will have a certain experience, and a certain like, way that I see myself represented in around the company, and take signals from that around where I do, or don't belong.

330
00:35:49,200 --> 00:36:00,300
And so, if you're not thinking about these aspect, when you're approaching something like Employee Engagement, really going to be missing.

331
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:05,400
The reality of the, many different experiences that people are having.

332
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,600
So I think we're seeing a bit of a split where there is a subset of companies.

333
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:22,300
That is, he's keeping to unite as much higher on the priority list, and I think see those folks have greater success on the retention side.

334
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,500
Overall, as a result.

335
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,500
No doubt, I, you know I have to dig into that.

336
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:33,000
You open up a door that I am super passionate about almost to a default.

337
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:52,400
It's, it's, I am pretty bullish on the fact that remote work when done, well can lead to a richer culture, you know, diverse culture, but it doesn't mean that it's necessarily, just going to happen.

338
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Like, it's not Just going to happen.

339
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:10,200
Just because now you're a remote company, you're going to reap the benefits of that and build, a very inclusive culture and a culture that within the company that builds for the world because it is diverse.

340
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,100
What do you seeing the implications of that?

341
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:21,500
So we're going from 0, folks are putting when, when folks don't prioritize there's there're some problems with that.

342
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,600
Obviously, but also, what are the benefits?

343
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:33,100
That you're starting to see and what kind of intention is needed to diversify the workforce in this new landscape that we go stepping into.

344
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,300
I mean certainly really right in that it opens up a lot of opportunities.

345
00:37:38,300 --> 00:38:08,500
We spent a lot of time internally talking about our own location strategy and having our location and hybrid strategy, actually be an explicit part of how we plan to recruit and compete for talent and thinking about diversity as one of the specific and explicit aspects that we're considering if we're opening up a new office or recruiting in different locations and what teams were opening up to do remote first.

346
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,300
So I think it opens up a lot of opportunities.

347
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:17,200
I think you're totally right that the intentionality in this is critical that.

348
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:44,400
Yeah, I think, you know, we know that we're talking about unconscious bias that Is not something that just quickly or easily shift, you know, it's something that we have been saved our leader just companies working on in different ways for a long time and there will be ways that I think it opens up opportunities for more inclusivity.

349
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:53,300
I think there will be new challenges that we figure out to, you know, what happens when your hybrid.

350
00:38:53,700 --> 00:39:02,800
And you start to get say there's a fairly large actually demographic, breakdown on, who's coming into the office or spends more time in the office or not.

351
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,400
What might that lead to and how are you thinking about that?

352
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,800
Yeah, now yeah, it's a build the culture around that.

353
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,900
This is, I mean, this is a right on Deva.

354
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:24,500
I love that you're speaking on this because, you know, we talked about leveling the playing field, and we talked about providing Equitable experience.

355
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,500
What does that actually mean?

356
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:27,900
Right?

357
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:32,200
Like these are hot terms and it's like, yes, I am gonna do this and yes, we're going to do this.

358
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:42,700
What does that look like as we're stepping into remote first, you know, one of the things that, that I have been having some conversations about with other leaders around this way.

359
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,800
Thing to say that.

360
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,600
Exactly what your tea and up to say that, okay, we're going to level the playing field.

361
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,800
We're going to do remote, it gives us access, and we can provide more opportunity.

362
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:06,100
That means if you want to live in Puerto Rico and you want to work from Puerto Rico and like have a yard with your roosters and your chickens and your family's there, but you can still work for a fast-growing, Silicon Valley company, then you should be able to go do that.

363
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:18,800
Now that person shouldn't feel like there's an unfair Advantage between where they're sitting and the people that are in the office rubbing elbows with people and grabbing the Fee, with that leader, that's walking down the hall.

364
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,600
What?

365
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,300
What, goes through your mind and that challenge?

366
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:30,500
And I know I am not, and I am not asking for the right answer because I know we're all learning in this fast-changing environment.

367
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:37,700
But what goes through your mind in that from an equitable experience, for employees that are going to be remote, like, we're going to be hiring remote employees, right?

368
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:43,500
If you want to live in Alabama, or in Iowa or importer Rico, go ahead and do that.

369
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,800
But how do I work as a leader to make you feel?

370
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,700
Feel included and feel like the Plainfield, like your voice.

371
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:57,300
Is as loud as the loudest extrovert that sitting in the town hall?

372
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,500
In front of the executive.

373
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,000
What does that look like?

374
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah.

375
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:12,500
I think the two big things that we're trying to do one is that we're really explicitly treating remote as an office.

376
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:19,600
And so we got Seth is an office York is an office blending, his office and remote as an office and got it.

377
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
We have a site leader.

378
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:28,000
We're setting up a site leadership team in the same way that we think about annually, what's our benefit strategy.

379
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:37,600
For the UK versus the us, we're talking about what is our benefit strategy for remote and bring it in as a layer.

380
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,100
Anytime.

381
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,300
We're thinking about our employee value prop, our employee experience.

382
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:57,800
I think that creating the platform then have some of those leadership voices, will be really important and also being able to cut our engagement survey data and all of these other data points that we have.

383
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:08,700
And looking at that, that cut of it, the other OB this investing in person and being able, whether it's all at once?

384
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:20,400
Or basically, we take a lot of the money that we're saving potentially on off a space over the years really intentionally, bring that back into combination of employee travel.

385
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:26,600
Like and like the actual events and different ways of enabling that hybrid experience.

386
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,900
Fantastic, you know, I love it.

387
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,500
Looks like folks are resonating as well with remote as an office, right?

388
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,900
That's a simple framing, but it's important.

389
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,500
Like, if remote weren't office, who runs that office, who's driving the culture within that office.

390
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:50,700
How are we handling spaces for people to connect and engage with, in that office is super helpful?

391
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:57,000
Let us go ahead and segue into some Q&A and guys go ahead and start flooding.

392
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,800
The Q&A tab.

393
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,400
We want to hear your voice, and your questions won't bring that.

394
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,600
First question up on stage from Robin.

395
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,200
What are you most excited about in 2022?

396
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,000
Dave, who most excited about?

397
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,100
I mean, so there's so much.

398
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,400
I make, I am excited, but I will say, actually, the very biggest thing.

399
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:29,900
I mean I am excited about is Possibility of bringing the whole company together in, in person will be at like six or seven hundred people.

400
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,700
And as interesting window of time before we're too big to do it, but after a lot of, you know, we're still covid Z, /.

401
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,100
So I would say that.

402
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:39,300
Yeah.

403
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:40,800
Okay.

404
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:52,300
The other thing I would say is, we're coming out with a comp product and I have always been a comp geek and so just getting a chance to work with the teams.

405
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,900
Internally on like product division around that has been much fun.

406
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,800
Fantastic.

407
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,200
Okay, I will be looking out for that.

408
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,900
I think we all need more tools as people leaders.

409
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:18,700
You know, the Gathering of folks is pretty magical in person, when we had our people come together, like it felt like we have been together the entire time, like people connected.

410
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,000
I mean, they were tears.

411
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,300
It was like, there's a like, what is happening right now, but it was so much richer when we came back to be a remote.

412
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,200
So Yeah, you know, that struck me too.

413
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:42,400
I had actually a similar experience, it surprised me because I have been in the office a couple of you number of times before, but we had a, we had like a Halloween party.

414
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:55,600
Like I literally almost broke down in tears because there were all these people, I felt like I had worked with but was getting a chance to connect with on a deeper level and I realized how much I had.

415
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,400
I have been missing that like it's been Yeah, really, really long 1820.

416
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,200
So like we need those connections.

417
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,600
Now that no doubt.

418
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,100
Okay, cool.

419
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:10,900
So I am looking forward to that for you as well, and we will get our people together in year two at welcome.

420
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,900
Let us go ahead and bring up a question from Emily.

421
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:21,700
What if employees don't engage show up or the same people show up for the event?

422
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,000
Okay.

423
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:35,600
So I think the additional framing here is like right now, you know, we  thrown internal town halls or a prg event and like how Like, how are you seeing folks, engaging?

424
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,100
And what are you guys doing to bring that up?

425
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:50,100
Yeah, so I think, and I remember having this challenge actually before covid as well, you throw the, you know, the office happy hour and often the same 20 people would show up.

426
00:45:50,500 --> 00:46:06,900
I think you really understand the diversity of your employee base and what people are interested in and what's going to get them excited and the thing that's going to get, you know, the account, exactly excited actually problem.

427
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,600
May be really different from what's going to get some of the engineers excited.

428
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:21,400
So just I have really tried to embrace like a wide range of different types of events and then also empowering groups and teams.

429
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:32,600
So we have really upped our ERG budgets and empowerment of leadership since their able to do more events giving budgets and an environment to department leaders, all of that.

430
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:33,900
Bring more folks in.

431
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:45,800
No doubt, no doubt, you know it's interesting as I am getting more and more into the space because I am you know, we're obviously part of the space and tooling the space.

432
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,700
What we're finding is that urg groups not just is not just the right thing to do.

433
00:46:52,200 --> 00:47:00,000
In terms of representation making people feel like they belong, but is actually a big culture driver and people, feel empowered to say.

434
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,500
Yes, you have a budget.

435
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:01,900
Yes.

436
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:02,700
You have space.

437
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,900
Yes, please go do.

438
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,000
And you have executive support.

439
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,700
To go do that matters tremendously.

440
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,100
I am glad that you brought that up going to the second.

441
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,600
The third question here from Casey.

442
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:27,100
What do you recommend for folks who are feeling unhappy with their current work set up, you know, she's 100% remote right now, but don't know what our tentative solution would make them happier.

443
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,200
Yeah, I think.

444
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,100
It's going to depend on by individual.

445
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,800
I think it is probably getting to the root of it.

446
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,800
Like, is it, is it a company that is just not remote friendly, right?

447
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:54,000
Or is it hey that actually want to be, but they're struggling on how to build certain types of connections and operate in this new world.

448
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:08,400
I do think that there're some folks like I know a fair number of people that just Personally, our office folks, and they really prefer to work in an office.

449
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,000
And that's okay too.

450
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,800
And I think so mix of really understanding the company and knowing your own desires to figure out.

451
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,500
Hey, is this, is this a match long-term?

452
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,400
I mean, this goes back to what we were two talking about earlier.

453
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:29,400
There's gonna be a whole reshuffling of folks as each company moves into their model.

454
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,500
Opting in or opting out of that, that company based on it.

455
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,500
Yeah, you know, it's just a tough one as well.

456
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,400
I Casey I think that it's for some folks.

457
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,900
They're loving the remote for others.

458
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:58,900
It's like I love it, but I don't at times like it's like this love-hate relationship where like the I love the flexibility but I hate this actual room setup because it's super echoey and I don't have the nice coffee shop right down the street because I am in The Burbs.

459
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,700
And every time I used to go into SF, it was not only good.

460
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:10,400
For me to listen to my podcast decompressed but also engage with people and I think that's super important.

461
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,800
I have some team members, and we're going to be working in 2022.

462
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:34,400
The idea of PODS and saying that for cities in which we have a larger concentration of people, we're going to have like, these co-working spaces where people can drop in and go connect and even looking at like stipends to say, you know what, like, if you want to actually go to co-working, Space.

463
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,900
So you can get your fix with people and all of that we're going to be looking at ways to make that available.

464
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,600
And I think Dave, I think that companies would love to hear your thoughts on that companies.

465
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:49,600
Need to be thinking in that kind of way, for the cases of the world where it's like, hey, I am here.

466
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,800
I like it, but it's not optimal.

467
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,800
Something's not right.

468
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,600
Like what's your, what's your take on that?

469
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,000
Our people?

470
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:03,800
What you're hitting on there is something we hadn't thought of it internally, but I have been hearing it pop up, isn't it?

471
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:57,500
What?

472
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,100
Idea, and I love it of.

473
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:06,900
All right.

474
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,900
Look, what do we do?

475
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:16,600
We didn't open up an office in Atlanta, but it turns out now that we have 20 remote workers all in Atlanta.

476
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,600
Like, why are we missing that as an opportunity?

477
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:28,100
And, so I think, you know, yeah, or even our idea of whether or not, there's an office in a certain city will evolve.

478
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,300
Is it going to be more of a, more of a spectrum?

479
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,600
I think there are a lot of people who are looking at that.

480
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,400
Yeah, no doubt.

481
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:36,700
Are.

482
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:43,000
We got a last question here as we're coming in for a landing from Spencer was the most engaging employee experience.

483
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,200
You have been able to execute in a remote world or in your case, the remote office.

484
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,600
And how, how are you measuring impact of that?

485
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,900
Someone one we did.

486
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,700
This was it was so much fun.

487
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:05,300
So we set aside three hours and I think we have been doing some different more like social events.

488
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,900
And so we wanted to do something a bit different.

489
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:17,100
We'd also been talking about like ideas of conflict and decision-making and communication with, with the company.

490
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:40,100
So actually, we brought in a group and it was it Like a business case study that they turned actually into like a gamified climbing of Mount Everest with like a software that ran it and you went through a number of stages and you had to get to decide in each stage.

491
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:45,400
Like there were, you know, there were some quite problems to figure out there really judgment calls and ethics.

492
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:52,200
It was like this mix of things that You went through for about two hours and then, and we it was intense.

493
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:58,800
It was really surprisingly intense and like people really got into, we did this with and it was kind of in this idea.

494
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:05,200
We were talking about before we did this with cross-functional teams people that wouldn't normally be working together.

495
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:17,700
There's a way and people actually, like kept up some of the connections afterwards and it I think helped us have a broader conversation about then some really meaningful.

496
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:23,800
Ideas of conflict and collaboration that we were talking about while still being like really fun.

497
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,500
There's like both a lot of fun and engaging but had some real content people.

498
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:31,600
Amazing.

499
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:38,600
Yeah, you know, it's interesting you mention content and content is really important in driving these experiences.

500
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,100
Right?

501
00:52:39,100 --> 00:53:08,800
If you're delivering, your content is not relevant to what people are feeling sensing Desiring, then it's like you go get crickets pretty much regardless of what you do whatever magic show you put together, you know for us we have been able I remember one all hands where I did a poll survey and it was I was I was feeling like, you know, our people To connect because it feels like we're a lot of folks are sort of struggling with this like burnout and sort of the remote on screens meetings to meetings and meetings.

502
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,800
And we had an all hands.

503
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,400
It was already booked on calendar.

504
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,400
So that means that everybody's are coming.

505
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:21,600
So instead of like giving you a big company updating going through metrics and all these, if the things we say, you know what?

506
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:33,900
We're going to do an all-hands focus on self care, and we're gonna do it right now and this is what we're going to talk about, and we're going to go in groups and just have a conversation and Check in and do a heart check with each other as well.

507
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:47,500
And it was I think one of those riches and riches experiences, but it was drawn from a need and saying our employees need this and so therefore it's going to be relevant and relevance means right now, which means that we're going to skip this planned.

508
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:55,200
He that we're going to push that out a week, so that we inject something for employees Dave.

509

514
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,200
Amazing.

515
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:16,700

516
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,900

Learn, what's happening.
