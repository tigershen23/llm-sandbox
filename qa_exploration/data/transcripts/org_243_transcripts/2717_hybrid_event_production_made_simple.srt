Of course, my amazing producer in The Green Room.

16
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,000
You put that right up.

17
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,900
All right, the big question for today.

18
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,400
How comfortable are you with hybrid events?

19
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,000
How many of you would say?

20
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I got this hybrid is life.

21
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,100
It's in my bones.

22
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,100
Are you're comfortable with it or not?

23
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,400
Really?

24
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,000
Sure.

25
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,900
No way not today with hybrid.

26
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay, and not sure sir.

27
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,100
All right.

28
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,300
Well, this is good that you're here because today we have got a packed out agenda.

29
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:21,200
We're going to start off with a Founders greeting, and then we're going to go into some of the key ingredients for engagement.

30
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:29,700
These are the elements that truly make, whether you're in person or whether your virtual, it makes it an engaging event.

31
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:37,400
So we're going to go through those elements and then go into the hybrid production, walkthrough with some of our very own hybrid.

32
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,100
Experts who are helping support our customers today with their hybrid events.

33
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,500
And then we're going to open up it up for interactive QA.

34
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,400
So jumping into some housekeeping notes.

35
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,500
Obviously, you see our chat.

36
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,900
It is lit.

37
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,700
Thank you.

38
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,900
Love seeing the fires and the love and the rocket ships.

39
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,300
Hello.

40
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,100
Alex charlena in the house.

41
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,100
So good to see you all and note that throughout this entire event.

42
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,400
We would love for you to drop your questions.

43
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,100
In QA, so, feel free to the.

44
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,200
You see that tab to the right next to chat.

45
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,900
Just dropping your questions there and feel free to raise your hand at any time.

46
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,600
If you have a question, and we will pull you right up.

47
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,100
Okay.

48
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:31,300
So with that, this is our drumroll moment before we get to the secret sauce of our hybrid events and bring you a little bit under the hood.

49
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,700
We want to invite our Founders to the state.

50
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,400
Here's a warm greeting from Roberto CEO.

51
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,400
And co-founder Jerry president and co-founder and tiger CTO and co-founder.

52
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,900
Harry went.

53
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,900
Thanks so much for being patient with us.

54
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,700
We have had a little bit of audio tweaks here.

55
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,700
And there, you know what, I have actually got our CEO Rob here.

56
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,300
Let us go.

57
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
We're gonna do this.

58
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,200
What's up Gina.

59
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,800
This is the amazing thing about virtualization.

60
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,400
Can't fake.

61
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:57,700
It.

62
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,300
It's real.

63
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:58,800
That's right.

64
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,700
You have to be performed.

65
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,800
We call it second cup.

66
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,400
All right.

67
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,300
The ability to say, you know what, technology will.

68
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,400
So you can kind of time you have to have an idea to enter locksmith go up and The wrong.

69
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,100
That's right.

70
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,400
Yeah.

71
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,200
So we have got a bunch of folks here.

72
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,800
Interesting, learning about hybrid and is here at a little bit more about how you're thinking about it as well.

73
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,200
And what is our students is?

74
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,800
Welcome.

75
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,300
Wait.

76
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:20,700
Okay.

77
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,100
So first of all hybrid, right?

78
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,600
Why are we here?

79
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,700
Why are you guys doing in?

80
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,900
Why do we have an employee here with us today?

81
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:35,200
I think going back to where we are today, even the pandemic, you know that it's a nice world and remote is here today.

82
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,500
The challenge is how do you connect people in a remote world?

83
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,400
How do you do that?

84
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Well, and so we have remote figured out technology.

85
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Enables people to show up on video and have conversations.

86
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,600
But then the challenge becomes how do you do that between two parties?

87
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,300
How do you do that with people that are in office and people that are working from home?

88
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,700
How do you do that?

89
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:01,900
If you're throwing an external experience and folks are tuning in from another country, but they still want to be part of that core experience.

90
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:08,600
You know, it's funny because I was talking to the founders even before we kick off here today and the idea was really around.

91
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,600
You know what?

92
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,300
Our customers are saying and what our customers are actually running into there's some common problems, right?

93
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,400
The biggest challenge is kind of bubbling up to the top.

94
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,000
Number one is known.

95
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,500
How is like, how do I do this?

96
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,200
How do I do this?

97
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:36,100
Well, right, part of it is like, how do I orchestrate this for two audiences, you know if we take a step back, and we look at hybrid and is basic form, its we have people that are in one place in person.

98
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
You have people that are remote.

99
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,300
And these are two parties and you can serve those two parties, really.

100
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,800
Well, right thing by like an NFL game.

101
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,100
There're folks in an arena.

102
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,800
They're having an in-person experience that's phenomenal.

103
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,900
And then you have people in living rooms around the country.

104
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,300
Also, engaging in a remote experience.

105
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,500
The challenge becomes.

106
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,300
How do you merge two universes?

107
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,500
That sounds like a challenge.

108
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,400
It does, it does.

109
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:07,300
And so on of the things we have been, we have been working on that welcome is building the technology that allows folks to drive real time experiences.

110
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,400
And so, Tiger who's our CTO at our company?

111
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,300
It's really about focusing on Building Technology.

112
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
That's built for real-time engagement.

113
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:16,900
Right?

114
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,300
And you look at real-time engagement.

115
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,200
That means rho time down to the second.

116
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:30,800
That means as folks that are sitting in the audience and focuses are at home, should be able to experience down to the second real-time content engagement, that makes sense.

117
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,800
Makes sense.

118
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,100
So it's like, so we do that.

119
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,400
Well, then what?

120
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,400
What else do we baked on top of it?

121
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,800
And that's our engagement layer?

122
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,100
R.

123
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,600
So you get video streaming right audio video, make sure that's real time.

124
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,300
Then there's the question about engagement.

125
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:57,400
Now folks that are sitting in audience and folks that are sitting in a person and remote what happens when they both want to engage at the same time and feed from one another.

126
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
This is where it gets convoluted really quickly.

127
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,400
Turns out that in our audience.

128
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,900
We have a bunch of employees right now on their mobile devices and you're able to engage in real-time.

129
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,100
I am so we can get some chat happening.

130
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,900
We're going to have some chat happening right now.

131
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,700
In real time from our employees from their phone, their listen to us in the audience.

132
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But also our virtual attendees can also engage at the same time, and they can see that happening with remote attendees and in-person attendees, and that's really amazing.

133
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,800
Because if you think about just the different types of personalities and wirings, like I am thinking about introverts versus extroverts.

134
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:47,200
And how, you know, oftentimes, when you're in person Event and all the extroverts get to raise their hand and maybe the squeakiest wheel, but now that there's opportunity to drop those questions.

135
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,100
Even if you're not comfortable going to the Mike and ask you a question.

136
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:58,500
Yeah, I mean talk to us a little bit about you say a lot about Equitable experiences and how technology enables that.

137
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:58,900
Yeah.

138
00:18:59,500 --> 00:18:59,800
Yeah.

139
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,000
I mean you're hitting it rights on the head, right?

140
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Equitable experiences.

141
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,000
In fact that welcome.

142
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,800
We have a Core Company value that speaks to open doors.

143
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,700
And open doors is about providing access, and we can go technology that provides access.

144
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,900
The challenge though becomes going back to how people are wired.

145
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:25,000
Some folks never want to step foot in an office because they were ready, change their lives and their work style.

146
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,100
And said, you know what?

147
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,500
This is my new normal.

148
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,900
I actually changed the way I work and it works really well.

149
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,900
I get to see my kiddos in the morning.

150
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,300
I have flexible hours and I can do this.

151
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,000
I want to stay here.

152
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,400
This is where I am like doing my best work.

153
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,900
Now that person let us say she's living in Alabama, and she's a phenomenal engineer.

154
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:51,900
Sure voice to be as loud as the voice of somebody that's sitting in Palo Alto headquarter.

155
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,800
At that company.

156
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,400
She shouldn't feel disconnected.

157
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,700
She should feel like she's part of that company, part of that experience.

158
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:04,400
And that is, he has a question that is at the same level as the loudest person in the room.

159
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,800
So no more.

160
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:15,700
So me to speak about Equitable experience has no more, is the loudest person in the room because we have technology that enables the best ideas to rise up and level the playing field.

161
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:27,500
So that's the power of like technology, not just for connecting people, but also connecting people and their unique wirings to show up how they are and who they are, right?

162
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
So is great because we have a conversations with amazing customers at welcome.

163
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,300
And the reason why they're investing in welcome and partnering with us is because we enable people to do.

164
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:43,100
Just that to say, you know what, I am a company that is embracing remote and or hybrid.

165
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:56,100
And I want to make sure that my employees Alice of where there are they still feel connected to us as a company and so when somebody submit a question at all hands, That question should be considered should be uploaded.

166
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,800
It should be part of the conversation.

167
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,300
Regardless if that person is tuning in from a little island called Puerto Rico, which is where I live.

168
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,100
They are still part of that core experience.

169
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,900
And that's, that's requires technology.

170
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,800
No doubt, but it also requires the framing and thinking of how to do that.

171
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,600
Well, how do you think knowledge is to enable Echo experience?

172
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:26,100
How do you think technology to empower a sense of belonging and so We talked about, you know, as Founders and I want to step out of your way here soon?

173
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,500
But as Founders, as we look at building, welcome and as technologists, Tech is super important, right?

174
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,400
There's a lot of fundamental things that we need.

175
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,400
But we also need to think about it very differently.

176
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,100
We need to think about it as a service to our people.

177
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,300
We're not just doing events just to do that.

178
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,500
So we're actually Gathering people's time matter.

179
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,300
You mean folks, they are tuning in right now?

180
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,600
Thank you for hanging out with us.

181
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,900
All right, I was about to do so.

182
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,800
Awesome move to keep you entertained while the mic issues being worked out, but that's what it is.

183
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:04,300
It's about, you know, kind of like falling back and say you know what, we're here to connect with people to gather people.

184
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,300
We're going to make sure that their voices are heard and Technology enables at.

185
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
That's so powerful.

186
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,900
I think in its time such as now ever more.

187
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,800
So we need this sense of belonging like you mentioned and human connection.

188
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,900
And the fact that we have technology to leverage to actually bring that sense.

189
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,200
The belonging is super catalytic.

190
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
Yeah, it's very powerful.

191
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,900
So, thank you.

192
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,600
Yeah, no, thanks for having me guys.

193
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,100
Again.

194
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,000
Thanks for being here.

195
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:39,300
I am honored that you give us some of your time, and we had we going to pull back the curtain and show you how to do hybrid, whatever company sighs, you're at whatever, kind of budget you have.

196
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,500
There's a way for you to level the playing field at your company, and we're honored that you're here.

197
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,600
Awesome.

198
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,500
Thanks so much job.

199
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,100
Absolutely.

200
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,000
Great.

201
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,900
Okay, so we're actually going to go right into it and take you under the hood.

202
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,400
With understanding, what are the key components that make hybrid events happen?

203
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,500
So I would love to invite Dylan.

204
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,200
Is there he is.

205
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,000
Hey.

206
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,500
What's going on?

207
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,200
Dylan?

208
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,700
Straight?

209
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,300
It's going great.

210
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,200
Yeah, how are you doing?

211
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,600
Absolutely fantastic.

212
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,400
Ready to dig into all the details of hybrid with you.

213
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,000
Awesome.

214
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,500
All right.

215
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:29,200
Well, what where do I start, you know, can be quite overwhelming to figure out hybrid production.

216
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,300
So Where do I start Dylan, you walk me through?

217
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,000
Yes, you are.

218
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,700
People, you can use this information that we're going to talk about today to be able to run any size of hybrid event.

219
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,900
Whether that's an absolutely large-scale conference down to an internal small company.

220
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,800
All Hands meeting.

221
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
That's awesome.

222
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,000
So what is the goal?

223
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:40,500
The goal of whole hybrid is more talk to our guard where we want to make sure the exact same thing.

224
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,200
We want to be able to make that experience Equitable for everyone.

225
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,800
So, I know most of us in this room, most people watching.

226
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:49,700
Really?

227
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,500
We have all been remote for the past year and a half.

228
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,100
And actually if you guys want to do me a favor real quick, if you all want to hop into chat.

229
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,000
Let me know how long you guys have been remote workers, whether it's just been for the last year and a half and the pandemic.

230
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
If you're going on 5 years, like myself go in their drop how many years?

231
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I see a 30 years remote that someone just dropped in.

232
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,300
I think that's the winner right off the bat.

233
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,700
You will keep throwing those in there.

234
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,500
I would love to see how long that you guys have been remote As we continue talking here, but all of us who have been remote.

235
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,300
We have been kind of going through the same.

236
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,000
Back and forth throughout the past year and a half.

237
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,000
We have got our Bluetooth headphones are pods USB microphones webcams.

238
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,500
Whenever we jump into our meetings, we're choosing which thing we want to be able to used to be able to speak to be out here.

239
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,600
So people can see us.

240
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:49,300
Well, what I am going to do today is break down everything between audio and video that exact same thing to show you that it only takes a few pieces of key equipment and get set up and be able to pull off.

241
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,700
Any type of hybrid event.

242
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:59,700
So, one of the key things to note, hybrid events can be customized to literally do whatever you want.

243
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,800
I mentioned earlier, you can do large.

244
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Absolutely High scale Productions down to the, you know, individual internal All Hands meetings.

245
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,600
So we can be doing stuff.

246
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:19,300
That's just a single camera and a single mic like we were seeing with Gina, or we can do a full panel, have five people on multiple.

247
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:33,900
Multiple microphones different camera angles, you can jump back and forth and be able to do all of those different things, but we're going to get over all the individual pieces for this setup so that you can see how simple hybrid can be.

248
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,100
So, a high level of what we're going to be going over.

249
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,400
Today.

250
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,300
We have two sections.

251
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:48,400
Like I said, audio and video your main three pieces of audio equipment that you're going to need your microphones, your audio mixer / interface.

252
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,700
And you're in person speakers.

253
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,400
For video, you're going to need your cameras and a video.

254
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:55,900
Switcher.

255
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,000
These are some extra pieces of equipment.

256
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
What we are doing for our event today.

257
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,800
We have multiple people speaking.

258
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,500
We have a couple different camera angles.

259
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,700
So we're kind of going for that higher level of production.

260
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,800
There going to be a couple extra pieces in here.

261
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:15,200
Erics do to be able to bring this down in budget and inside, whatever is going to customize and work for you guys.

262
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,300
So, with that being said, let us jump right into our audio overview, so Step 1 microphones.

263
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,700
The Easiest step.

264
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,100
What a microphones.

265
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,900
Do they pick up your voice?

266
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,800
They make sure everybody can hear you both in-person.

267
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,000
My team here and virtually everybody who is watching right?

268
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,300
Now.

269
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,800
These are there are two major types of microphones that you guys can grab.

270
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,200
We have got the wireless ones.

271
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
Like I am using, you have the ones that plug right in.

272
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,500
There're tons of different options that you can choose from, but the main job of your microphone is to pick up the presenters voice so that everybody can hear you.

273
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,200
This takes us into step to your audio mixer and your interface.

274
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,200
This piece of equipment right here.

275
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,700
Is your critical piece of equipment to make sure that everything is coming together.

276
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's going to be doing two major jobs for you during a hybrid event.

277
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:18,600
First, the job of the mixer, each microphone is going to be plugged into an individual channel in the mixer and that way you can control your presenters volume.

278
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,900
So if you have someone who speaks very quietly are soft, they're microphone away very easy to be able to turn them up.

279
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,300
Someone whose super loud since to project their voice a lot like myself.

280
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,600
You got to watch that and be able to pull them back down.

281
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,800
So that's the first job.

282
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,500
The mixer.

283
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,200
The second is the interface.

284
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:42,200
This is where we get into some more of the nitty-gritty details, but I am going to break it down and make it super simple for everybody.

285
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,500
So, the interface is doing two major things here.

286
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:56,000
The first thing it's doing is taking all of this live audio everything that I am saying for every One who's sitting in this room, and it's bringing it into the welcome platform.

287
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,400
So that everyone who is virtual, can hear what I am saying?

288
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,500
The second job of the interface is to take everyone who is virtual just like Gina was earlier.

289
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,800
Take everybody virtual all the videos that you're playing through.

290
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:17,300
Welcome the music, any other virtual presenters that you have and be able to make sure that they can be heard in your in-person audience as well.

291
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,700
Why is this so critical?

292
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:27,100
This helps remove two of the major issues with hybrid first?

293
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:33,200
It's going to allow your in person and your virtual attendees for have the exact same experience when it comes to audio.

294
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,500
Everyone in person.

295
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,600
Everyone virtual is going to be able to hear and experience the exact same thing.

296
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,900
And second.

297
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,400
It's going to move feedback.

298
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:47,200
There's one of the biggest problems that people run into when they're trying to do hybrid of its how do you talk to someone?

299
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,300
Who's remote, how you have that back and forth?

300
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:56,200
Conversation without there being feedback mixer and that interface is that keep peace.

301
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,700
That completely removes the problem of feedback without that set up.

302
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,700
None of this would be possible, and we're talking from the large conference events.

303
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:10,900
Like I was saying earlier, you can have five panelists up here, talking someone in New York someone in San Francisco.

304
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,600
People here in Las Vegas.

305
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:18,300
They can all be having a conversation back and forth and that's possible because of your audio interface.

306
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,600
In step three is your speaker's, the in-person audio.

307
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,600
So the audio interface everything that's coming out of welcome.

308
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,800
You plug those right into the speakers in your room, whether they're on the side up in the ceiling.

309
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,400
If you guys are doing it in a hotel, that's going to make sure that your in-person audience hears everything that's going on.

310
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,100
So that's it for audio.

311
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,700
That was a lot of information.

312
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,400
Don't worry.

313
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,500
We're going to be sending some stuff for you guys afterwards.

314
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,400
So don't worry.

315
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,300
We got some notes.

316
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,700
We're going to jump into video, Step One is our cameras.

317
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,700
We have, you guys are all familiar with sing camera setup.

318
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,800
That's what we have been doing for the past year and a half.

319
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,200
You have your face time cameras built into your computer.

320
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,500
So you might have a USB webcam.

321
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,700
You guys use this on a daily basis.

322
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,700
It's super simple plugs right in.

323
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,500
In easy to use in hybrid events.

324
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,300
However, you're more than likely going to want to be able to show multiple camera angles and multiple views.

325
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,900
You may want to show more of a close up like after seeing right now.

326
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,400
We may want a wide shot showing the entire stage.

327
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:29,300
If you had a lot of panelists, you may want to get super fancy and have someone on one of the moving camera panning across your audience.

328
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:37,100
All that you need to be able to do that is people to man your cameras and make sure that they have an HDMI output and you're good to go.

329
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,700
Now.

330
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,700
I say that, but you guys are thinking when I plug this stuff into my computer, just one camera.

331
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,100
How do I take five or six different video feeds and put them into one?

332
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,300
That's our second piece of equipment.

333
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,800
Here are Step 2 under video.

334
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,200
The video switcher.

335
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,100
What?

336
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,600
This is going to do is take all of those video feeds from all of you're different.

337
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:06,400
Cameras, put them into one piece of equipment and then you are going to be able to choose what you want your audience to see.

338
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,800
So, while I am up here on stage speaking, if we had a different setup.

339
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,500
We could be panning across our audience, to see everybody watching right now.

340
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,600
It's just a click of a button and everybody's going to be able to see that exact same view.

341
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,400
So you can focus on your speaker's, your audience.

342
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,300
You can create the experience that you want to Via the video switcher.

343
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,500
So it makes it incredibly simple for you to show your in person.

344
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,000
Virtual audience, the exact same thing.

345
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,100
And one last thing to note just kind of natural piece.

346
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,500
Here is what you're in personal finances.

347
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,400
Seeing up mentioned that a couple times.

348
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:47,400
One of the easiest ways to do this and what we are actually doing right now, is we have one set up in our attendee view.

349
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:53,700
So everything that you guys are currently seeing that, our virtual attendees everybody in our room is seeing exact same thing.

350
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,600
So, everybody's talking in chat.

351
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,400
We have got QA, we have our poles.

352
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,500
We're going that back in.

353
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:06,800
Fourth, all you have to do is plug that into your live video feeds, so then everybody can be engaging in the exact same way.

354
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,900
Now the final step bringing it all together.

355
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,400
Bring it in for a landing.

356
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,100
How do we get it all into?

357
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,600
Welcome.

358
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,100
How do you do that?

359
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,200
We're talking all these different pieces of equipment.

360
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:37,000
There has to be a ton of extra work to be able to do this, and I am actually really excited to say it's the exact same process as choosing your are pods or choosing a webcam to be able to put in when you jump into the welcome platform, when you're in your producer View and you are adding feeds into the Green Room.

361
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,400
Drop down menu, pops up.

362
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,000
All you're going to choose is those specific video.

363
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,900
Switcher and your audio interface that's going to grab everything that's happening for your in-person audience and be able to put that virtual.

364
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,200
So an everyone is seeing the exact same thing.

365
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,200
So wasn't out high-level overview, and don't worry.

366
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,800
Like I said earlier, we're going to be sending this out to everybody.

367
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,800
So we got you.

368
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:12,800
Audio, you got your microphones that plug into your audio mixer and the interface, which plugs into welcome.

369
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,300
It's bringing all of your audio into welcome for your video.

370
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,900
You have got your camera's, plug it into your video switchers, which are going right into welcome.

371
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,900
And then, on that audio side, everything that's happening in.

372
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,300
Welcome is what's going to be coming out for your in-person audio?

373
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:35,000
And then same thing that video feed, everything that you guys are watching right now, is what we are going to be bringing.

374
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,800
Out for the in-person video.

375
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,199
And that's just about everything that you need to know Gina.

376
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,300
Let me toss it back over to you.

377
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,600
I want to hear your thoughts.

378
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
I just talked for way too long.

379
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,900
What do you get for me?

380
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,400
Does that all make sense?

381
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,000
Where are we?

382
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,300
Hey Dylan, thank you so much.

383
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:00,900
I am going to actually bring you back on stage with me because there's there're some questions coming in.

384
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:10,200
I mean you're a whiz, you have got this dialed in, and we definitely want to share out that diagram to all those who are attending.

385
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,900
Today.

386
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,000
You're already getting some questions.

387
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,400
So let us go ahead and answer Jaclyn's question here.

388
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,400
So are there particular audio interfaces that you'd recommend?

389
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,100
Yes, that is a fantastic question.

390
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,300
If you go and you just Google search, this, you're going to get tons and tons of results.

391
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,500
There are two brands that after doing live and audio events for probably about ten plus years.

392
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:45,500
Now, the easiest way to be able to get this set up for you, a company called Behringer and a company called Allen & Heath.

393
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,500
Both of those have your audio interfaces and the mixers.

394
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,000
They're built into one machine.

395
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,500
It's going to make it super simple.

396
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,300
It is quite literally.

397
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,300
Lee the most plug-and-play that you can get, so Google search.

398
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,400
Those going to solve all your problems?

399
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,800
Awesome.

400
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,100
Okay.

401
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:07,300
Here's another question that I think you can help us answer, Dylan from Jacob Castro.

402
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,200
How much does setting something like this up cost?

403
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,700
Say one that would require two cameras and two microphones with audio interfaces.

404
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,800
Yeah, Jacob.

405
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,200
That is a great question.

406
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,000
The nice thing about this is it all depends on the level of production, that you And to do.

407
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:30,000
So we're talking two cameras to microphones the audio interface, essentially the same setup that we have right now.

408
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:42,700
If your budget buying, we do this for $1,500, if you really wanted to, if you want to get super fancy with the cameras and the microphones and everything else that you're using honestly sky's the limit.

409
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:51,900
But to be quite Frank, probably $1,500 to five grand range, anything that probably going above and beyond what you need somewhere within that range.

410
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,100
You're gonna be able to find everything.

411
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,700
I mean, Dylan just keeping a real what's are set up.

412
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:02,400
Like if you were to describe what we have got here, with our Audio video.

413
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,300
And what's the guesstimation of cost?

414
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,300
For what?

415
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,900
We're how we have pulled this off?

416
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,300
Yeah, that's a great question.

417
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:15,500
So, we have a couple different microphones that we have set up that were using, they're all Wireless, which those tend to be a little bit pricier.

418
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,500
And we have a couple different camera angles set up that we're capturing everything from as well.

419
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,800
So I think we're doing a three or four camera setups.

420
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,800
We have got the videos watching.

421
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,800
We have our audio interface, and then we have three different microphones that were using as well.

422
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,600
Well, there's a couple other pieces, we're talking cables and stuff like that.

423
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:40,100
But for the most part our total cost came in just over five thousand dollars to be able to do this full set up.

424
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,600
Gotcha, that's good.

425
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,600
And then what are you seeing these days with our customers?

426
00:37:49,600 --> 00:38:04,200
I know we have got a range of hybrid event use cases, but generally what would you recommend for, you know, a set up a 500 attendees like could what we have today work for 500 attendees.

427
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,200
5,000 attendees, you know, you have to upgrade equipment at that point.

428
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,600
It was a very good question.

429
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,700
So to be completely honest with you, these types of things.

430
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:24,000
I always like to take it on a case-by-case basis because it's going to depend on the level of production, do the people on your team, have any experience with audio and video.

431
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,800
Is it easier for you to just hire a production company and then welcome teaches them how to plug everything in like.

432
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,600
I just did, there's a number of different options there.

433
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,700
But to answer your question, our set up those key pieces, that video switcher.

434
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,700
And your audio interface.

435
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,700
Are you can use that for a room with 500 people or with room of 5,000 people?

436
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,200
Like I said, if you have good pieces of equipment, for those two specific things, you can make anything happen.

437
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,500
The sky is really the limit.

438
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,400
No.

439
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,700
Alright, Tyson young has a question.

440
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,600
Is there a fall back?

441
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,000
When things go wrong?

442
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,000
Yes.

443
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,800
It happened earlier, you got to get creative.

444
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,800
If you can't get creative when you're doing your events.

445
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,700
If you want everything to go, right?

446
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,800
I am sorry, you're going to be stressed out all the time.

447
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,200
That's just, it's just the way life is fall back.

448
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:25,600
What I always do by W amount of equipment that you need, when we're talking cables by good stuff, cables break.

449
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,400
So easily.

450
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,900
Think of your phone charger tossing that thing on the side of your bed, traveling with that, they break because they're really cheaply made get the really thick.

451
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,400
Solid ones and you're going to have that thing for five six years.

452
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,700
Hire out people, if you're not confident in a skills, if you want to learn tons of resources, we can teach you.

453
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,500
We can walk you through step-by-step.

454
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,400
If you want to alleviate the stress of everything.

455
00:39:49,400 --> 00:40:02,300
From the production side, higher production company come to us, teach them how to put everything together, but the fallback be ready to be creative, be prepared for things to go wrong and by double the amount that you need.

456
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,700
That's great.

457
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,700
Okay, I am going to take one more question here.

458
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,100
Let us see.

459
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,800
Andrew is asking what does it look like at the venue?

460
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,400
What does what I got the venue.

461
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,000
Do we have our amazing video guy Faulkner?

462
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,200
Do we have any views of our room right now?

463
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
That's a no case.

464
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,500
Everyone was running.

465
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,600
There's a wall, beautiful wall.

466
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,600
Nice, wall right there.

467
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:38,700
Okay, we view that we have got But to answer your question, kind of what we have on our walk you here.

468
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,000
Because Gina and I are both up here.

469
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,400
I am kind of cutting a little bit.

470
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,900
We have got both of our banners on either side of me, right?

471
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,300
Outside of both of those.

472
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,300
We have our screens so that everybody in audience.

473
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,500
Can see chat queue, a, the polls, everything else that's going on.

474
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,600
We have a couple of what we call confidence monitors.

475
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,700
So as I am looking into this camera right here?

476
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,500
I have another TV screen right underneath.

477
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,100
So I See, Gina and be talking directly to her.

478
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,600
I have got a team right here on my left running all of our audio and video needs.

479
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,100
And I have got a bunch of other people walking around making sure that I am staying on time and talking about everything that I need to talk about.

480
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:18,700
Awesome.

481
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:26,900
Thank you for describing all that Dylan and just being awesome at walking us through all things hybrid event under the hood.

482
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,800
Please continue to just drop your questions.

483
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,000
We would love to maybe answer some at the end.

484
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:41,100
I would like to transition now into some five key ingredients of what makes an engaging event.

485
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
So, thank you, Dylan.

486
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:52,900
Dylan walked us through some of the production elements of Together a hybrid event thinking about the in person as well as the virtual.

487
00:41:53,100 --> 00:42:04,700
And so we're going to quickly go through these five ingredients of Engagement that you can consider as your hosting both the virtual and the in-person side of your event.

488
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,400
So, I will go through that.

489
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,800
In the meantime, continue to drop your questions.

490
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,400
We can bring Dylan back up and even Roberto back up to answer any of your questions.

491
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,700
So here we go.

492
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,000
Five ingredients and of Engagement.

493
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Well, they look like this.

494
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:28,600
It's there's set the tone engagement to be considering that strategically transitions networking and speaker experience.

495
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:47,000
So going through those elements, you know, when you have engagement you truly have this experience and all of these elements that were describing actually help connect your physical attendees with your virtual and attendees so that you create this one shared experience.

496
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,500
So setting the tone, let us start with that, you know, engagement.

497
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,300
It's not just a chat.

498
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,500
It's not just that networking or any of these other places.

499
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,600
It really starts at the top.

500
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,900
It starts at the beginning.

501
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,100
And so the intro we believe is one of the most important.

502
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,400
It's like no matter what.

503
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,000
Let us say, like, we had some audio glitches earlier, right?

504
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,000
These things happen.

505
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,900
So it's really important to set that positive tone of your event from the very GetGo.

506
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:24,200
Continue to thread line the same level of energy and excitement through your entire event because you don't know.

507
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,600
There could be some things that go wrong in Virtual and hybrid.

508
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:34,600
But this is part of the beauty of Live Events and part of the beauty of this is human.

509
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,600
It's real.

510
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,600
So, going into it.

511
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:50,200
There's some other components that help you set the tone, and we have got here, you know, at the top video countdown clocks were your countdown up until your Event actually starts height videos.

512
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,600
This is where you can use royalty free videos.

513
00:43:53,600 --> 00:44:01,900
If you got a public audience and audio as well, or if it's a journal, then you can use, you know, music of your choice video of your choice.

514
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:08,300
You want to make sure you have an MC and a facilitator, that's thread, lining your entire event.

515
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:16,400
We have got sound effects and also housekeeping that we did at the beginning, which was also really important.

516
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,000
Now the Second ingredient is engagement, and this is what everybody's talking about today.

517
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,000
How do we solve for this problem?

518
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
But both for our virtual audience, our in-person audience and keep it consistent.

519
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:34,100
A lot of it is in intentional intentionality and thinking through your run of show.

520
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,400
But there's also some features and welcome that really support engagement in a powerful way.

521
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:53,600
Now, of course, we have got chat and there and then there's interactive QA where you can actually have people After questions bring him on stage and have a dynamic conversation with those who are asking their questions.

522
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,700
Pulls like we did at the top.

523
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,200
We asked your sentiment on your comfort levels around hybrid.

524
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:08,000
And so at any given time what's great is, we can make quick adjustments to these questions and put up any kind of pole.

525
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,500
So those elements definitely help.

526
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:21,000
Now, the third ingredient is transitions, It's can be magical if you're intentional about them.

527
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,500
It's often an overlooked thing to be like, okay.

528
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,900
Well, we know this is the main part of the content.

529
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:45,000
And here, here, but thread lightning, all of those chunks of content throughout your segment with seamless and the right transitions can really Elevate the engagement and your brand experience virtually and in person in a powerful way.

530
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,400
So how do you do that?

531
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:54,300
I mean, you have got Obviously your MC facilitator, that's continuing to threaten line, no matter what happens with the event and whichever direction it goes.

532
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,800
They thread line.

533
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:08,100
That energy the sentiment they provide direction for your audience and you they can the audience can navigate accordingly and this works obviously for in-person or virtual our media and overlays.

534
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:15,600
So being able to quickly put up videos audio and then put up overlays right now in The Green Room.

535
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,900
I have got our producer.

536
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,600
Linda helping me out.

537
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:30,000
Just putting up these overlays and this creates for a much more engaging experience and also for transitions from Dylan segment to my segment.

538
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,400
So on and so forth.

539
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,800
And of course the pools feature.

540
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,500
Those can serve as a great tool of transition when you want to go from topic to topic section to section.

541
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,600
The fourth element is networking.

542
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,300
So we hear this.

543
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,900
We see, we see this in person.

544
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,100
We see this virtually as well and you know in welcome, we have got breakouts.

545
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,400
We have also got lounges the differences breakouts.

546
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:03,900
There is a pull so virtually you can automatically pull people into different breakout rooms or in person.

547
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:09,900
You have assigned specific workshops or rooms that have topics of discussion.

548
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:17,000
So breakout serve as a pull, whereas lounges or exhibit Halls, have a push experience.

549
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:26,000
And so in the in-person experience, that would look like an exhibit hall, where you have got branded Booth space and Banners and swag.

550
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,500
You got your lead generation trackers, and you have got a point of contact, a warm face.

551
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:35,500
That's willing to walk the, the guests through the brand experience of that.

552
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,000
Boot.

553
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,600
Same thing can happen virtually as well.

554
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,000
In welcome.

555
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,500
We have got a branded sponsored experience.

556
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,900
Where you can have a point of personal point of contact.

557
00:47:47,100 --> 00:48:01,800
Who is actually welcoming every single person coming in have call to action links, you know, any downloadables, any kind of prizes are gifts that, you want to do trivia, all that can be done in our breakout and Lounge experience.

558
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:09,900
And of course, having a facilitator, I think is really key in any of the networking experiences to be very effective.

559
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,000
You want somebody?

560
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:18,100
That is the representative of your brand and, you know, I think these are some of the small things That get overlooked.

561
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,200
You want to get the right energy?

562
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,100
The right personality and have your call to actions, your swag.

563
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,400
Whatever it is that you're giving away.

564
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,500
Ready in that networking experience.

565
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,100
Now, finally, it's the speaker experience.

566
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:37,400
I believe it can make or break a 360 experience of an event.

567
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,300
And so, you know, we have talked a lot about the attendee experience.

568
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:46,800
We have talked a lot about the producer side of putting a hybrid event together.

569
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,200
Either.

570
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:58,400
And now when you think about your speaker's, you want them to have just as much of a meaningful experience as your attendees and your producers.

571
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:04,200
And so, you know, in welcome, we have actually got a green room and it's right beneath the screen.

572
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:11,200
I can actually see my producer Linda and all the other folks that are within our Green Room.

573
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,900
Hello, and, you know, just like an in-person breeder, right?

574
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,900
As a speaker.

575
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,500
Just about to go onto stage.

576
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I have got nerves.

577
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,600
And so being able to be in a green room environment where I can calm down.

578
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,900
I have got my speaker, check my mic checks right?

579
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:35,500
Visual checks, and I have got a warm face in the green room from the producer.

580
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,600
That's calming me down as a speaker.

581
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:51,500
So not only do I have that experience before I go on stage, but there's also a countdown clock that's keeping me on time because for me, I mean, am I countdown clock is giving me the ten minutes signal right now, right?

582
00:49:51,500 --> 00:50:02,900
So it's very helpful for speakers to be able to see those that time check, especially if they have a tendency to go over and then finally, The Green Room chat.

583
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,100
This is an exclusive chat.

584
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:09,400
That is only between the speakers and the producers.

585
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,900
So those in public.

586
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,400
Cannot see the speaker experience.

587
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,600
So there you go.

588
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,600
Those are the five key elements.

589
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,000
We went.

590
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,100
Then pretty quickly.

591
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:40,500
It's setting the tone supercritical of making or breaking that event and how the pacing in the feel, the energy goes, and then the engagement transitions networking and a speaker experience, which gives you this 360 experience that you could be considering when you're putting your hybrid events together, both in-person and virtual.

592
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,500
All right.

593
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,900
So we have got about 10 minutes left, and we still have some questions.

594
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,900
Can I invite?

595
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,600
Right, Rob and Dylan to the stage to wrap this up with our final questions here?

596
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,600
All right.

597
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,300
Two, three.

598
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,000
All right.

599
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,800
That's my bad.

600
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,600
Blame it on me.

601
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,500
I am the guy with the mic.

602
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,400
I didn't the button.

603
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:38,900
There.

604
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,500
It is.

605
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:44,800
That's part of the stays at, doesn't know how to use a mic.

606
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,000
So that's as part of the challenge, as well as events.

607
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,000
But Gina, thanks so much for 14, it up.

608
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,500
Great questions from the audience already.

609
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
One of the things I was talking about is things will go wrong.

610
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,200
You have to be creative, be able to fit it.

611
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,100
Have this technology.

612
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,000
You need to get people on your team.

613
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,300
They're not going to freak out and shut it down.

614
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,900
The mic is not working.

615
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,600
And sometimes, it's as simple as clicking a button on the microphone to make sure that it's on.

616
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:15,700
So, anyway, dear.

617
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,400
What questions?

618
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,500
Do we have teed up here.

619
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,800
I will do my best here to answer.

620
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,300
All right, we have got a question from Gordon.

621
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:29,900
Are you going to be showing under the hood with the welcome interface itself?

622
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,400
Okay, Gordon, great question.

623
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,600
Couple things here.

624
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,600
Like, what is the go?

625
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,200
Why do we do this event to begin with?

626
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,300
We did the show you behind the scenes?

627
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,600
We are actually the team has diagrams and follow content.

628
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,300
They will be in touch with you on.

629
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:53,100
It's going to show you all the things on which plugs and how to do this and which cameras and what bud you have to get and hybrid event on.

630
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,700
And yeah, so we will be opening it up during this event.

631
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,900
We are not going to flip the screen over and show you the Green Room.

632
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:04,000
Use our website, you start to see some of that book a demo.

633
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:12,800
If you want to see The Green Room live and in person and see how that works, but we will be following up with more content enables you to understand all the ins and outs.

634
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,300
All right.

635
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,100
Next question from charlena.

636
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,700
How many people do you need to run a hybrid event?

637
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,900
Good question, you know, this is an interesting one.

638
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:30,500
I think you can get pretty creative with running a slim team.

639
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,200
And empowering them to do a little bit of things in doing really, really well.

640
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:40,800
I think about hybrid is connecting an in-person audience and a remote audience together.

641
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:55,400
I think should have on your squad at least three people as I think about using a platform driving moderation of Engagement with in chat and making sure somebody in the producer seat that can keep the show going.

642
00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:01,300
I think one of the things Whitney's is has a ton of experience doing this as well as an Of ours.

643
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:06,200
She's recommending anywhere from three to five people, depending on that experience.

644
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,400
And I would agree with that.

645
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,700
I think you can get a really Stellar experience with a crew.

646
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:18,500
That's equipped to be creative and knows, I know how to use technology and know-how to turn on microphones as part of that.

647
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,600
All right, we have got another question here from an.

648
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,900
Is there a live audience at the location?

649
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,300
As it would be an actual hybrid event.

650
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,900
Is there a live audience right here?

651
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,100
Yes.

652
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:33,900
This hears it up.

653
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,600
Here is a live audience here.

654
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,300
Let us go.

655
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,500
Let us go.

656
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,600
Alright.

657
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,100
Alright guys, there is a live audience here.

658
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:59,100
One of the things I don't think it was here earlier was there we all equipped with a mobile companion while they're actually engaging live.

659
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,700
Now, sit with that for a second.

660
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,800
One of the things that we have been working on.

661
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,100
Welcome.

662
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:08,000
It's really understanding like what are the Dynamics of people gathering in person?

663
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,600
And from one of these is a small thing, but it's very important.

664
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:21,000
It's never somebody sitting in the Location are typically just hearing a one-way communication, hearing the person on stage with a microphone and a message.

665
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,500
And they're Translating that's a perception being received.

666
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,000
When you are in remote environment.

667
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,600
There's a two-way communication.

668
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:35,900
There's a person on stage but it's also the body of people having a narrative around the information that's being delivered.

669
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:49,800
And every attendee in that experience is actually walking away with the perception of both the speaker voice and also the Collective voice of the people and that's the perception they walk away with when you're sitting in person.

670
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,000
And you can't connect and here and engage with the other 500, people that are remote.

671
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:00,000
It misses that rich conversation that you can walk away with.

672
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,100
And so hybrid done.

673
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:09,900
Well, enables those confirmations those conversations to flow in a way that you walk away with that perspective regardless of your person of your environment.

674
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,100
So, yes, we have real people sitting in seats here in Las Vegas.

675
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,400
Do you have another question?

676
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,200
Yes, we do.

677
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:17,800
Okay.

678
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,500
Another question from Gordon.

679
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Is there a recording of this event that is able to be shared post-event?

680
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:24,900
Absolutely.

681
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,700
That's a good question.

682
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:32,000
I think that yes, we can recordings and Snippets are gone here guys and I will talk to him about this.

683
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:37,200
Basically open up the hood and Empower you guys to throw hybrid experiences.

684
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,800
So we want to be as open as possible sheer documentation.

685
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,400
Share video, shared diagrams share even like Hardware.

686
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:45,400
Ends.

687
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,500
So you can go and do these events yourself.

688
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:53,000
So, yes, look for posts emails from our team that will follow up with these resources.

689
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,100
Awesome, and we have got one last question here from cell.

690
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,900
How does the live audience engaged without a laptop?

691
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,500
Since a platform requires Google Chrome on a machine for these features?

692
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Well, there it is.

693
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:10,700
It's called.

694
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,000
Welcome, ha.

695
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,300
We are teams working.

696
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:18,800
Relentlessly around the clock to enable you to tune in from any device that you have.

697
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:19,600
Right?

698
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,900
So if you're in person and all you have is your phone, that's all you really need.

699
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:23,700
Typically.

700
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,900
When you host an experience people are on their phones.

701
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:33,500
Anyway, you might as well use that phone and bring that experience to not just a remote but improve the experience across the board.

702
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,600
So, yeah, all you need is really your phone.

703
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,300
We're working on, it's working today.

704
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:38,700
We will be reviewing.

705
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:45,800
And that here, shortly that empowers everybody in the audience, regardless of where they locate it to engage in the equal playing field.

706
00:57:45,800 --> 00:58:00,000
Meaning that if someone has a question in there saying, Alabama, Her voice is heard just as loud as the person jumping behind this room trying to get a hold of the mic and that's the power of hybrid as power of using technology to connect people.

707
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,100
We question.

708
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,000
That's awesome, Rob.

709
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,600
Well, we're coming to our time here, where we're going to wrap up.
