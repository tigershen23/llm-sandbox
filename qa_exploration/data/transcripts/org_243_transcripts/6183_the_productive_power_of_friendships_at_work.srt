Well with that, I would love to invite the panelists if you don't mind joining me here on stage.

We can hear you, okay great.

37
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,800
Yeah, it's so wonderful to see each of you if you don't mind introducing yourselves.

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,100
And let me know where you're tuning in from as well and I will start with you Nadia.

39
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,000
Great to be a Gina.

40
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Hey everyone.

41
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,000
I love looking at all your locations extremely distributed audience so that's a lot of fun.

42
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,700
I am here in Johannesburg.

43
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,100
We finally have rains celebrating that Latakia.

44
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:44,400
And I am VP of people at remote, we have gone through significant scaling in the last two years, and I am celebrating my two year anniversary at remote in December.

45
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,200
Hand it over T Rodrigo.

46
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,300
Hey Rodrigo, I am tuning in from Southern California where it's nice and sunny outside.

47
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,700
I work for a company at coat called torch.

48
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:08,900
People success manager over here were a remote first company where we really served to fuel professional growth through the power of trusted relationships and really on the for employees democratize access to coaching.

49
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,800
And then for companies really provide some powerful analytics on the back end to help produce like Roi.

50
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,200
So excited to be here today.

51
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
Awesome, thanks Rodrigo.

52
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,800
Laura amazing, thank you so much.

53
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,200
I am Laura the VP of marketing here at Loom I am joining from Colorado about 20 minutes, west of Denver's right?

54
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,000
At the foothills of the mountains, and Loom is a video communication platform for work.

55
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,400
So we help our connectedness among teams while also feeling a reduction in meeting by allowing teams to communicate via video messaging.

56
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,300
Love it.

57
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,800
All right, well before we jump into this discussion, I would like to pull up this Gallup stat that I had found.

58
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,100
So Katie, if you don't mind pulling that, you know, having the best friend at work is increased employees.

59
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,700
Workplace, net promoter scores during this post pandemic.

60
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:10,900
And so as you can see in 2021 2022 having that best friend at work a lot of folks, strongly agree that it can make a big difference.

61
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:18,500
This is in retention in having a thriving employee experience and communication, commitment, and ultimately outcomes.

62
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:33,000
And so, what I love about this discussion, Katie you can pull that down right now, we will Jump Right In what I love about this is we're not just talking about having a bestie at work, but there's actually productivity.

63
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,900
We're seeing that there're results from these surveys that Gallup has conducted in business outcomes.

64
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,900
It's in having these type of productive relationships.

65
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,500
So, I would love to unpack this conversation a little bit more with each of you.

66
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:56,900
How are you seeing the importance of building and maintaining strong workplace, relationships through the employee life cycle?

67
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,600
I will start Gina if that's if it helps the panel yet, I would love to hear from Laura and Rodrigo on this topic as well.

68
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,200
I think, for me, social connection is so much more, especially in a remote in hybrid environment, right?

69
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:22,600
And we also, remote first, I didn't mention that earlier, but like our name, we are absolutely remote first in more than 75 countries with more than 900 employees.

70
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,900
And I think that social connection leads to the ultimate as Of belonging.

71
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:38,299
And if you cannot be friends with people at work, or if you don't have that type of connection, it's really difficult to trust someone, if you don't really know them.

72
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:45,800
And if you don't actually have any interest and connection with them, so to me, it really starts on that.

73
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:53,200
It starts about the impact can really impact your culture, how you work day to day, how teams connect with each other?

74
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:02,200
I think behind that comes a lot of intentionality and will Speak a lot more about that in today's store but Katie a little bit from Laura's.

75
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,100
Well, yeah.

76
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:13,000
And I think that friends really hold you accountable and unintentionally kind of hold up a mirror of the value and the caliber of work that you're driving and producing.

77
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:27,700
So when you see your friends or at the very least, people that you empathize with or trust doing really great work, it inspires you and it also kind of gives you a template in a framework to do, your best work as well and at the end of the day, we have probably an easier time letting a business.

78
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,000
We have a harder time letting our friends down or the people that are relying in depending upon us.

79
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,800
And I think that's one of the Crux is for why it drives value from a business perspective.

80
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:44,400
But also friendships, just make us happier because we spend so much of our time at work on these little Zoom boxes and screens.

81
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,400
It's so important to also have fun and not just always kind of be grind in through it.

82
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,800
So right on, I guess the only thing I would add to that is I think that one of the most important things about friendships is that they had meaning to work.

83
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:13,000
I think working sometimes be a grind in regards to the tasks that you have but doing them alongside of people that you respect the you trust and then you build a sense of purpose with really adds meaning to the things that you do.

84
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:36,000
It allows you to once you build trust with people, you're able to come alongside each other because you know each other because you can see where your spread thin You need help where and specifically like, where one person might have a specific skill set, that needs to be highlighted and in turn things, that they're not good at taking off their plate, so that you can actually have the right, players on the team, on the field, doing the right things.

85
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,800
Yeah, that's how much of that scheana.

86
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:49,200
Now that Rodrigo mentioned that if you think about the world of remote work, hybrid companies in person companies, communication is usually at the core of everything.

87
00:10:49,300 --> 00:11:01,200
If you have great relationships with people at a social level and at a friendship level, the how, and the way you will communicate is just so different from you would with someone you don't know, right?

88
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,800
And so, it does actually unblock the communication gap, a little bit as well.

89
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,100
This is someone gets to know me, they will know.

90
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
How I talk.

91
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,200
Why you certain slang?

92
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,100
Living out here in Johannesburg?

93
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:27,800
And so it does actually, I think it does take a few barriers away when it comes to communication cultural differences because you take the time to get to know each other and so that can have a huge impact on asynchronous, communication and positive intent.

94
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:36,000
Because with friends, you're going to have that positive intent on a way higher scale than which you would with someone you absolutely just don't know.

95
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,500
So those Things come into play.

96
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,500
I think as well.

97
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:58,700
I think that positive intent thread is interesting and you know, at some point I would like to pull that a little bit more because I think there's so much misunderstanding that can happen while we're just seeing each other on slack as emojis or oh that person didn't respond to me within 5 minutes of my chat.

98
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,100
Like, are they upset with me?

99
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,900
You know, there's a lot of miscommunication that I feel can happen very easily as we're working in this remote circumstance.

100
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:20,400
So I guess across in thing about that life cycle, employee life, Cycle again, and each of you are our leading teams and hiring folks onboarding off-boarding folks right across that entire life cycle.

101
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,200
What are the key opportunities across and employees lifecycle Journey?

102
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,100
Do you see where you can help to as a manager?

103
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Build those moments of trust and encouraging building?

104
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,100
The right kind of relationships To me and Haley starts on the day you make an offer.

105
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:52,400
The moment you say yes to someone onboarding actually spots, it doesn't start in the day you start because there's such a nearly like a runner-up towards day one.

106
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:10,500
And so taking of a little bit of pressure Away by scheduling a, welcome call having an onboarding buddy, or if you have a cohort or something that intentionality is needs to be there for someone to feel, welcome and excited, and they cannot Pressure on them to schedule on day one.

107
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,400
If you say to someone, you need to schedule 5 coffee Chats on your first day.

108
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:34,100
Chances are they not going to schedule any because they weren't no way to start but if you take that pressure away and set them up for that first day before they join it, kind of sets them up for success, and they feel very comfortable you know to enter that first day I never start with a question about like so how's your first day been?

109
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,200
So tell me about leading up to day one like what's been happening?

110
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,400
In your life.

111
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:50,100
How is your, you know, how is your family, taking your friends, taking the news, and immediately start to get to know things outside of work, there might drop a pet name, you know, Etc.

112
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,600
And so I think it starts date.

113
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,000
It's also the hardest time because right?

114
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:03,700
It's like first day of school, first day of University College, whatever the case may be, is the hottest time but also the best time to start introducing that.

115
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:14,000
I completely agree and I think we talked about this too when we were catching up before even coming on here live but an onboarding buddy I think is so important as well.

116
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:25,800
Just it can be somebody that like isn't maybe going to work with them every single day to like you really want a pair like these cultural ads so you can bring life into people's work immediately.

117
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,100
So it's not just somebody that's going to be like telling them how to fill out a Google doc or create a template but somebody that can also answer those like where's the bathroom?

118
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,800
Jen's that they're not going to feel comfortable asking their manager, especially in a remote workplace because that would be super weird.

119
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:45,000
But like, you need people that can kind of feed off of each other build on each other and can teach them the language.

120
00:14:45,000 --> 00:15:04,100
Because any new company that you start at, you really are relearning, how to work relearning, how to communicate, everybody uses slack slightly differently, you might be in Threads or you might be in a lot of channels or everybody might just respond 121 and having somebody that can kind of show them the ropes and that way is how you really start to build an ingrained cultural.

121
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,500
Culture.

122
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,900
It's thinking about all the little things not just how work gets done, specifically from a project perspective.

123
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:20,500
I also think to your point Gina talking about off-boarding is also really important especially when you think about wanting to retain more people.

124
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:27,500
So if you have somebody that's leaving and you really didn't want them to you don't want to just like shun them or like ignore it.

125
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:37,600
This is like a really important time to build connections, Foster, ongoing relationships, and ideally, make sure that person is Champion and a cheerleader for you and your org from the sidelines.

126
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,100
Because friendships don't stop.

127
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,700
When you disconnect from your company.

128
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:48,700
Zoom, you want to build connections that are going to be Everlasting and Tech, or your industry is probably a pretty small town so to speak.

129
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,500
And those friendships and connections can only help our you and your future career.

130
00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:01,200
Wherever you, may go next, as well as continuing to drive insights, and valuable institutional knowledge for your company after that person has departed.

131
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,900
That's so good and huge.

132
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:12,000
On the off-boarding side I think is managers it's so easy to kind of fall under you, like, you don't know what to do.

133
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:21,200
And so it just kind of like an after it becomes an afterthought, a lot of times but really securing that off-boarding and celebrating even the transition.

134
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,300
And the decision of the person transitioning, I think is a huge win.

135
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Do you know, the only thing that I would vote add is I think that the other major point that relationship, screw, Credibly important is transition points.

136
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:59,100
You think about when someone gets promoted when someone moves into a different apartment we put all this emphasis on onboarding but it's almost like the way I have seen a frame sometimes like in boarding to a we put as much intentionality into helps helping someone transition into something bigger, something new like the first time someone manages people like those are big scary things which they're jumping into something new.

137
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:07,099
And so really being intentional about those times to really, really I think sometimes are one of the most I overlooked points in the life cycle of an employee.

138
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,000
So good.

139
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,200
I am actually going to pull in a question here.

140
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,900
I am seeing thank you everyone for dropping in some of these questions in queue.

141
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,700
A, let us actually pull in that first question from Riya.

142
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,200
Are there specific initiatives and programs?

143
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,099
You'd suggest organizations Implement to enable more work.

144
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,900
Friendships both in person and virtually.

145
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,000
So, I know we're getting a little bit in the, in, maybe a tactical idea here of initiatives.

146
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:45,900
But as we're talking about that employee life, All, what are some ideas recommendations that you have in these initiatives and programs?

147
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,100
I think a very simple one in the world of people is just leaving space in a budget for meetups.

148
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,000
So whether that is local International like whatever budget you have.

149
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:12,200
I mean we are in a year of sustainability and efficiency a lot of tech companies are, and so I know that people budgets aren't very stretchy but living space like whether that's 60, 100, 200 dollars for meeting up and having a meal together doing something fun together.

150
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:22,000
I have seen folks go on Hikes together, go, I had an experience with a remote We used our own budget to do hot air ballooning when they visited South Africa.

151
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,700
And it was such a cool experience, and it made me realize that budget.

152
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,900
I am not 100% sure.

153
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:34,100
I would have been able to commit to that amount in that sort of stage of my career when it happened.

154
00:18:34,100 --> 00:19:02,900
And, so I just think it's so important to make Financial space in your budget for it, like tactically and it up, it doesn't have to be a lot of money, so that's a nice in person initiative, but also gets very Tribute teams together in smaller locations especially if you're not doing a company-wide Meetup but there's so many other beautiful tools like take a child, take, you know, tools to get together virtually as well.

155
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:16,600
I sometimes laugh, when we get this question because it's like easy for all of us to say like we're VP is, were people leaders like making space intentionally for social interaction, we can do without the fear of any backlash.

156
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:38,000
I think that a lot of the times ice needs or first-time managers or people that are just more Junior in the org, don't feel like they have the space or the, okay, or the go-ahead to be able to just have a team virtual happy hour or, like, have a competition of who had the best Halloween costume and so being able to Set those examples and encourage the teams to set up those two.

157
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,400
That time is really, really important.

158
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:52,800
You can't just assume the team leads know that they can do that or that I seized conspiracy had that from the ground up like you do have to lead, by example, and you should remember to like clearly articulate that to your team's to give them the space.

159
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh that's yeah.

160
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:12,800
I think the only thing I would add to that is I think sometimes there's always the issue of like what we do, but I think sometimes the most important thing is to recognize why we do it and that's why I like one of the things that we have really found important is giving people opportunity to serve together and what comes about from that.

161
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,300
Like, for example, I got to brag on one of my co-workers.

162
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:33,900
Renee she launched kind of welcome like a culture team at our company, they call them culture Champs and, you know, they talk about Ways that they can celebrate, you know, hello is goodbyes, you know, big a big event, you know, but the bigger part of it, yes, those do things that produces things in the company.

163
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,200
But the biggest thing that happens is what happens among the team itself.

164
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,000
Once they are serving together, once they are doing things together, that is where the bond really is happening.

165
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,300
Is the way that they bond with each other?

166
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:54,000
So, the more that you can facilitate initiatives like that, that usually ends up being kind of just such a fertile ground for people to build friendships and really build development and develop.

167
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,600
You know, trust among each other.

168
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,700
That's powerful.

169
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:22,600
So there's a lot of lead by example that I am hearing there's some over communicating as managers as leaders that we need to do to make sure that our individual contributors are managers are all knowing that they have permission to be able to gather and come up with activities of gathering is there like a sweet spot number of in-person impromptu.

170
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,700
Gatherings that you have seen work, you know.

171
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
Like what's the right?

172
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:32,000
Cadence because you know some folks they're going to do a company Gathering maybe once a year.

173
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,900
Maybe there's some leadership, only Gatherings that happen throughout the quarters.

174
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,800
But is there a Cadence that you're seeing employees really responding?

175
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,000
Well to, you know, is there like an excess amount in a given quarter?

176
00:21:47,300 --> 00:22:04,900
We should have at least these amounts of asynchronous opportunities to meet along with maybe some virtual You know, I don't know if happy hours are still in but having social Gatherings virtually, like, what are you seeing as working and not working?

177
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:14,200
Nadia, I am so interested in here if you have a magic number on this one, but I feel like for me it's like a programmatic thing.

178
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:26,600
So anytime if I can feel the team is really stressed, or we have just done or in the middle of a really big project or work is starting to feel like all work, no, play kind of thing, even though that's the hardest time too.

179
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,100
Stop work for a social interaction.

180
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:38,000
I often think that's the most important time to remind people to come together to build friendships that have fun to talk about how hard it is.

181
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,200
Like it.

182
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:45,700
All these things don't have to just be like manifested positivity, like sometimes it is just being able to be like this is tough right now.

183
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:55,100
Like now let us have a virtual beer and getting to gather town or something like that just breaks it up and acknowledges what's really happening from a programmatic perspective?

184
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,600
I think it's like identifying those moments.

185
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,000
Pants as they happen is just as important as having things pre-planned.

186
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:11,400
I think, for me, social connection is also sometimes and especially if you want to build that deep connection, you really need to look at that team size.

187
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:24,400
Because if you're doing it, company-wide really hard, how people show up in front of people, they don't know, at 900 employees is, much harder than looking in team like five to 10 people.

188
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,400
And, so I really like doing something socially with the people team.

189
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,000
If I And twice a month.

190
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,600
If I can't once a month of yeast, that Cadence just works really well for us.

191
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Interesting fact, is our people meetings that Weekly at a stage was social first, and meet and work second, and that was our weekly.

192
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:53,800
People meeting everything else was soft, async we became better and better at solving hard problems.

193
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:00,600
Asynchronously, wherever (else) than doing it on a zoo call or virtually together that together.

194
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:07,700
Time became this fun card weight over the top, you know, opportunity and it never sat with me.

195
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:15,000
I realized that if I become a single source of failure to create social connection, I need to make sure the whole team is responsible for it.

196
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So we have to rotate the ownership of it, everyone in the team.

197
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,900
And if there's someone that truly doesn't want to do it, absolutely, they can reach out and go.

198
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,900
I need to skip.

199
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,600
This is way too much for me.

200
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:34,800
This is not something I am comfortable with and that works as well but I think we have created is Through the creative things people come up with a my brain space.

201
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:53,300
In terms of creativity has a limit, I have a lot of things to think about in one day, but the things my, you know, the people team came up with was so incredible and so fun, we lost week, we did a picture to play who's in our people, enablement team, and she asked for a picture of your fridge.

202
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,500
And you know, we did this like live meet.

203
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,700
I have been guess, like, who's very just that there was a name for it.

204
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,500
I can't remember the game, but it was like a nap.

205
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:09,600
It was so good and you know looking at people's fridges working at a remote company, our team is distributed in more than 10 countries just the people team.

206
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:21,600
It's really hard to get together but it created this like super weird connection about oh my gosh we use the same butter or, and I am on the other side of the world and so that devil of connection was really fun.

207
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:28,800
Also, how we crossed guest people that are similar and just realizing, oh my goodness, this person.

208
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,600
And this person did have some of the fridges We focus that.

209
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:40,600
So I think it's really about that lightness and doing it regularly, but the size of the group matters, meetups at a company.

210
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,000
This size in 75 countries is really difficult.

211
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It takes a year to organize it.

212
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,100
There's always inequity experiences, right?

213
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,100
Someone's going to have to fly for more than twenty-four, five hours.

214
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:59,500
And usually it's the crowd from Africa, the crowd from Asia, and a pack in Australia, New Zealand and that stuff.

215
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:06,100
And, so I think the pandemic halted a lot of in-person M, I would certainly like to see more of them.

216
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:20,400
I think the only thing that I would add to that is that aside from kind of the in-person Gatherings and stuff like that is the importance of just finding small ways to incorporate it into the rhythms of our everyday life.

217
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:30,000
Like I mean one of the things that we do for a lot of our teams is basically whoever's birthday it is they rotate like someone figures out like what's the favorite color?

218
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:41,800
Like what some favorite things, and then we just all come that day dress in a favorite color or like you know having a virtual background just little things like that are kind of Moving into the fabric of everything that we do usually ends up being really meaningful as well.

219
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,200
These are great ideas, Samantha and chats drop an idea.

220
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,700
We did something similar where on our Global employees screen, share Google Street View.

221
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,200
Yes.

222
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,100
And walk through neighborhoods.

223
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,100
Love that really good one.

224
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah, that's great.

225
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,200
Yeah.

226
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,900
If any of you have any other ideas that's working, please drop it in chat.

227
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,300
Thank you all for sharing these.

228
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:13,800
Yeah, these are ideas that I am like taking notes on, and we're going to figure out how to implement them with our team like today.

229
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:24,200
You know, going back to the point, Laura, you were talking about intentionality communication, like we need as Leaders to be examples to do this.

230
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:30,000
How are each of you intentionally championing friendships at work today?

231
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,100
Like, what is this?

232
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:36,000
Look like in your day-to-day in your month to month and your quarter?

233
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:47,700
You know I do think it is a lot of what we have talked about already like it is setting up and making space for it so it is making sure that all of your team meetings aren't just business down to business.

234
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,800
Like, you have to set aside space to have fun.

235
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,100
It is onboarding buddies.

236
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,100
It is celebrating Transitions and promotions and whatever it might be.

237
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:04,300
And making sure that everybody feels comfortable with that, it's all of the ideas we have had in the chat and then also it's allowing your team, the space to like, decide what they want to do themselves.

238
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:13,300
So, one of the things that we actually do is a quarterly quarter day here at Loom, so each of the sub departments to keep the team's a little bit smaller to Nadia's Point.

239
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:26,800
Get Pick a Friday that they come in for a quarter of the day, just to spend time together, socially, purely social, and then they sign off for the rest of the day and get to go live their lives and do whatever they want with their own friends or people in their lives, or whatever it might be.

240
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:33,800
And I think that's been a really great way to make space, not just for friendships at work, but friendships outside of work.

241
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:41,900
So you're consistently connecting with people around you in your life, without always having to be plugged in and on and responding to the millions of questions.

242
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,000
And I think that things like that are really important.

243
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,100
Similarly, there are people that I try to Champion when I see them doing really well for building up culture.

244
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,100
So if somebody drops like, hey, this is what I am listening to on Spotify.

245
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,600
In our marketing team chat, I will always send them a DM.

246
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,200
That's like thank you so much for like being such an advocate for building a culture here at Loom.

247
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,000
That's incredibly important.

248
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,800
I would love to see you continue doing that and almost always those people start building on one another.

249
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:20,300
And when one person is doing in that in the chat and it's not coming from a leadership perspective, because that always is, Like forced sometimes fun but it when it's like the ICS and the people that are creating this from the ground up, that's really.

250
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:26,000
When you start to see to Nadia's Point, like all of the creative ideas that you never would have thought of before coming to life.

251
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:35,200
So it is like making sure that you're praising people for being cultural Advocates, the same way you praise people for doing a really good job on a project hoof.

252
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,700
That's huge, you're talking about what you celebrate, what you encourage, what you don't as leader.

253
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:46,200
I think that's huge in indicating and just guiding the direction of the culture.

254
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,600
Any other thoughts Nadia Rodrigo.

255
00:29:49,800 --> 00:30:02,800
I love doing exactly that they're in a public, thanks Channel because not only are you like celebrating the person but all of a sudden, everyone else sees it and it's interesting how those things do manifest, because someone else use it.

256
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,300
And they like, yes, I needed that today.

257
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:19,500
I needed to see your French Bulldogs, like, do something really weird in a single call or, you know, I needed to see your kids like cycling or whatever the whatever you're into and I think it's like is a great space for it.

258
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,900
Formal communication.

259
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,600
I think the pandemic blood alliance you know so much.

260
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,900
We became formal communication.

261
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,800
And so if you don't make space for that thank you.

262
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:37,900
Like thank you so much for posting that amazing, you know, update or Spotify playlist or video or whatever.

263
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,400
And what I also like is we have an IRL channel.

264
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:55,300
So in real life looking at that is also manifesting something the amount of people that are clicking an emoji and saying, Like wow, I wish I was there is manifesting ideas of who should I meet up with?

265
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,900
How can I use my budget?

266
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:07,700
Like I need to connect with people, and so I am seeing interesting requests about, can I use my meter budget to do something virtually because I am not near anyone.

267
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,100
And so that's what other ideas for people in my seat to go.

268
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,400
Oh my goodness, there's some unfair Equity yet.

269
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,200
We need to figure out how to meet that person's needs.

270
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,700
And, so I think yeah is about Public thanking but I love that idea.

271
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:29,100
Laura, the only this one thing I will add about this connection ID.

272
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,600
So one-on-ones, this is not just about manages any.

273
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,000
I see you can do this as well.

274
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,900
Anyone and one that you start, if you start that with a question about.

275
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,100
So, Gina, let us say, your dog is, like, Luna and I go Gina.

276
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:53,300
How's Luna doing you mentioned, you know, Luna refused to go out for a walk last week, all of a sudden you're going to remember Amber that I remembered your pet's name and that they refused to go out for a walk.

277
00:31:53,300 --> 00:32:01,800
And it was so significant to you when you shared it with me, that, that, that builds, that one-on-one connection with leaders, and Isis, and peers.

278
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,900
And so at all levels, you start really manifesting connection.

279
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:18,300
And I think that's often missing in the world of Zoom not that product, the environment infrastructure just because everyone hates an agenda or like, you know, starts a DM with.

280
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,300
So what have your priorities In this week?

281
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,200
And we can all stare care of that and David until later in the course.

282
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,500
So to me, that's really important.

283
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,100
It's also that one-on-one time.

284
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
I love that video.

285
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,800
Paul told me, I will see you will see me around a message about something he purchased, or something.

286
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,500
He's kid did like a random photo of his kid to doing something.

287
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,900
You know, very random, very extreme, very cute.

288
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,700
And to me, I think that relationship at all levels is necessary.

289
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,000
It's just, it's not supposed to be just a joke.

290
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:56,300
It is supposed to be everyone that has that social connection with each other so good.

291
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,300
Yeah.

292
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:11,700
I think one of the things especially for companies that have gone from an in office setting to having to be remote or hybrid, I think we can easily fall into the Trap of feeling like we have to recreate the in office environment, and we kind of just have to come to terms with the fact that's not possible.

293
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,300
I mean there's a reason why I like you know Mark Zuckerberg is spending billions of dollars.

294
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:28,800
Drinking the metaverse was like we got to leave that to him, but we I think that there are ways in which we can look at the outcomes that come from in-person interactions and reverse engineer it from there and kind of building.

295
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,400
This s*** is around that, you know, like I think about like what happens oftentimes.

296
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,600
It's like if you're an in-person setting, what really happens is self-disclosure you end up being vulnerable.

297
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,600
You end up sharing your story and from that comes connection from that comes belonging from, that comes building a sense of trust.

298
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:53,400
And so, we have really leaned into creating avenues for people to Are their narratives because that doesn't always happen very naturally in setting.

299
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,500
So like one fun thing that we did is we launched this thing called me to Torchy.

300
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,900
Oh, we're basically we just do an interview, like it's really funny like basically it's like a 10-minute interview.

301
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:11,500
We asked him questions, you know, ranging from kind of like what kind of coffee they have in the morning to like who their best friend was in junior high to my personal favorite is I ask them.

302
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,600
You know if you were given a year-long sabbatical what would you do with that time?

303
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,100
And then we do a bunch of different settings.

304
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,000
We found ways to do it live during our Person retrieve.

305
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:27,000
We just did one that we just recorded, and we just dropped it in the, in the general Channel and it's interesting.

306
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:33,100
Basically, it's once you create that content where people are able to put out their story out there.

307
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:40,000
People build connections based on that, you know, like one of the people that we did a me to torture with was a gal cat.

308
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:46,900
And in doing that, I found out that she is a child of an immigrant and you and she was raised by immigrants and then that's my story too.

309
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,199
So we end up having a whole hour long conversation.

310
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,300
Just on that.

311
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,400
And that wouldn't have been something that we would have like, naturally.

312
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,100
Like that doesn't.

313
00:34:53,100 --> 00:35:02,700
Exactly come up in conversation, naturally, you know, and so providing Avenues to where people can intentionally share their stories really, really proves powerful and just making that stuff happen naturally.

314
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
That's so good.

315
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:19,000
The storytelling aspect are there any just tactical ideas in how you can facilitate you know, within your team Gathering of the stories and then sharing of them?

316
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,800
We have done like a trivia session.

317
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,200
We're starting Nadia.

318
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,400
Oh, we have done like a trivia session where I will DM the people on my team in the background and ask them random things.

319
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,000
Like, what is one weird thing that you have about food or opinion?

320
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:56,400
You have about food or tell me one embarrassing story from your childhood or tell me the moment that you're the most proud of and then I will put them all on a screen and everyone will try to like match who they think it is in the chat and then the person will reveal themselves afterwards and Give us more context about the story or the moment or whatever it might be.

321
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:08,000
And that's been a really fun and funny way to like, learn more about people's lives, without having them feel like they're a talking head, would just, like, spewing a story at somebody for five minutes kind of thing.

322
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,800
It adds, like some freshness to how they're sharing.

323
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,000
Love that.

324
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,200
Nadia did you have a?

325
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:27,300
Yeah I think it will hand is even a really nice time for storytelling and specifically stories that are meaningful to that person it can be about anything.

326
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:39,100
And, so I am actually considering implementing storytelling it remote in Q4 where instead of having like all hands and another update, we so good with a sink updates at remote.

327
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:44,500
I would love to leave a bit of space with someone can just share something that's happened this year.

328
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:57,900
And the outcome or the impact on them and again, we can bring different trains, we can bring different subjects, we can bring the fun side of it in but you know has remote work had a meaningful impact on your life has remote.

329
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:03,100
The company had a meaning for you impact on your life and so you start building a connection with someone else.

330
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,500
Who's going to listen to that story and go my goodness?

331
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,200
I can relate.

332
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,500
I have to set up a coffee chat.

333
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:14,700
This person exactly like Rodrigo said he found that connection with someone that I didn't know existed and that was accidental.

334
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:26,600
All right, and so in a remote company you need to find a way to set up accidental connection and that's a great way to do so, you know, two things I would throw in on that.

335
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,900
I think one of the things that becomes really, really important in.

336
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:40,300
This is to make room for different temperaments because like we have had a very intentionally look for ways for introverts to be able to, you know, engage with this you know, because obviously we're going to do an in-person interview.

337
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,900
Like I remember when I was talking to folks to do them at all Retreat, you know, one Was a great candidate for.

338
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,400
It's like, there's no way I am going to be standing in front of 160 people.

339
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,300
That I have never met telling my story and that really.

340
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,200
So that's why we end up also doing ones that are written out and put them out in the newsletter.

341
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,500
So like really making, you know, avenues for different folks on that.

342
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,800
One thing that our company did that was incredibly powerful.

343
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,500
We just had our in-person Retreat and Utah in our CEO.

344
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:14,600
I am sorry one of our co-founders LED this really it was kind of like life story Workshop.

345
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,400
To where people were able to sit with their, with their story, reflect and kind of create chapters to their story.

346
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,500
And then there was three different sessions that they did ten minutes.

347
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,400
Each the first one was going over a high point.

348
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:31,700
Second one was going over a turning point that it was going over a low point, and they were just able to share with each other on that.

349
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,400
But I think the most important thing about that one is that it was modeled by the top.

350
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,300
Are you know, a co-founder was able to share his story first?

351
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:47,600
So he was able to say hey here's what it looks like and secondly Like you was a really able to model like guardrails.

352
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:55,900
If you will like you went through this whole thing about kind of like the scale of vulnerability, you know like one to ten, you know, here's under, sharing here's oversharing, here's kind of where you want to be in the middle.

353
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,900
So creating those buffers.

354
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:05,900
And really that modeling really, really went a long way to people feeling comfortable, sharing their story and really engaging and it was incredible.

355
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,600
The kind of connections that were built by people.

356
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:14,700
The level of self-reflection that happen and kind of just, it was really exciting and, you know, and we're looking at ways to do that.

357
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,800
We as well because you know in person thing is a little difficult.

358
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
So yeah, that was one thing that came up for us.

359
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:27,700
What I am hearing is the theme of just humanizing one another that's like yeah, it's the bottom line.

360
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:34,300
Like, I think we have missed that when we were in person and just always in the office you know, 23 years ago.

361
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:47,300
And now as we're trying to adjust to figure out how to work asynchronously, a lot of those human, just basic components, get lost in the interactions.

362
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:53,300
And so being intentional and I think articulating and In those things out is so important.

363
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,900
And I am hearing a lot of that lead, by example that over communication.

364
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:05,100
It almost feels like you have to over communicate, even ten times more than you did when we worked in person.

365
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:05,800
You know.

366
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,100
So yes, thank you for sharing those ideas.

367
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,600
I want to jump right into some of these Q&A questions.

368
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,700
We have one, that's been upvoted from Dan mohel.

369
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:24,400
Katie, if you don't mind, putting that on stage, I have read push back to calling workmates family, it can get toxic, we're all family.

370
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:31,500
We work late while making business decisions like replacing people, how do we balance the idea of friends?

371
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,400
While remaining professional great question.

372
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,500
Anyone.

373
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,100
Yeah, I don't think work is.

374
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,800
I don't think your family work with you.

375
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:51,900
You're not going to off-board a family member, you're not going to have a very Frank or difficult discussion with them, or maybe you would, but I think it's harder to do it with someone family.

376
00:40:51,900 --> 00:41:02,100
And with, I think when you call someone family, it does blur the lines of the relationship boundaries were really important at work.

377
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:19,100
I have met people and work that I am absolutely best friends with To the state, whether we work at the same company anymore, not and I think those relationships to time and how much I shared in the beginning, versus how much I would share with them in my life stage now is very, very different, right?

378
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:32,900
But I think it's about the our boundaries and I think what you're sharing and that vulnerability, I love that God real story that Rodriguez s*** about storytelling with God, rails, and reflecting and showing up for that.

379
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,400
You can write a guideline of, you know how friendships at work.

380
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,100
Work.

381
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,500
You can open source it for amazing other companies like all of us.

382
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,800
And then we can, you know, all share that experience.

383
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,200
But I think it's important to have guardrails and place.

384
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:52,300
And I don't think you work with your family, unless you really do unless you're a small start-up and have a bunch of having rivers, but I think it is.

385
00:41:52,800 --> 00:42:00,700
These are your colleagues and your friends and there's a difference, I love looking at the comments and Sandra.

386
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,600
I think you hit the nail on the head to where the imagery of Team.

387
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,900
Oftentimes, it's so much better than family because yeah, like Lee like you're, you know, for lack of better term.

388
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,700
You're stuck with them like it's a, it's a permanent relationship.

389
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,400
When you think about the imagery of team, it's all about.

390
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:31,000
Do you have the right people on the field and there're times to where someone is the right person on the field for a season but things change and now and then someone else actually becomes a better fit for that and having that framework to where everyone has the Viewpoint of what's best for the team.

391
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,800
What's going to produce us winning?

392
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,000
Then it doesn't become as personal, you know, like maybe I am for a season.

393
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,200
I was right person for this position, but then things changed and I had to move to another position.

394
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,000
So having the image of Team feels a lot more healthy than the imagery of family.

395
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,400
I completely agree with that and was going to use like a really similar metaphor to talking through it.

396
00:42:52,400 --> 00:43:12,600
But I think that it is so important to understand that, like, when you are part of a business, ultimately the businesses survival and the, what's best for the business is the only thing that matters and that like, sucks to hear, especially in a community like a Station where we are talking about humanizing things and it is important to bring human elements to work.

397
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,200
But at the end of the day you are all there so that this business can survive and so it can hopefully Thrive.

398
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:34,400
And unfortunately when we look at the macroeconomics today, when we look at what's happening in the world, the perspective of what businesses needed, three months ago, one year ago are all incredibly different, and we're seeing a lot of really hard change happen to companies right now and that's not personal.

399
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,700
That's not you excommunicate somebody from I am your family, it really is just you have to take people out of it.

400
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,500
When you are making really, really difficult business decisions.

401
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:50,500
And when you're making decisions about your family, you can't take people out of it because people are at the Crux of it, and that's the core difference.

402
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:56,300
Now, what I will say is like that gets harder and harder As you move up in your career when you are.

403
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:05,800
And I see I actually think it's okay to have like your fam of people that Empower you, that are your peers at work because you're not making decisions about their well-being.

404
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,200
How long?

405
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,300
They're Be staying at the company how well they're going to do or delivering performance reviews.

406
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,200
Having hard conversations or having to have the ultimate hardest conversations about exiting a business.

407
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:27,800
I think it's okay to like rely on your peers and I do think a lot of those friendships transcend, the business, a lot of the times and you're making decisions that impact those friendships and that work group.

408
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:36,200
Now, that's should stay at like a peer level, sometimes those things change, people get promoted and then, unfortunately, that will rupture change the friendship.

409
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,900
And Some kind of meaningful way, but that's kind of the game that you're playing.

410
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,400
When you are building friendships at work.

411
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,100
It does just look quite different from building, friendships from somebody.

412
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,300
You met at your yoga class or whatever?

413
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,000
It might be, there are different.

414
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,000
There're different steaks.

415
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:53,800
Very good.

416
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,500
Clarifications yeah.

417
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,000
Wow, I am like taking all these mental notes here.

418
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,500
I will be able to re watching the recording and definitely jotting down the notes.

419
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,500
We have got another question here from Hamza.

420
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:16,200
How do we mitigate or prevent biases unconscious implicit bias when they are healthy friendships at work?

421
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,300
That's such a meaningful question and it's so hard.

422
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:34,700
I think it's really hard in the role of managers and any one of the people team because if you have that framed in another team, how you need to make decisions about that has to remain unbiased.

423
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:44,300
You have got to keep that intact and I it's never ever easy but very often when I need to make really difficult decisions.

424
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,600
I put everything aside and have a good fact.

425
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,500
Because that is going to tell me what's really going on.

426
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:57,600
So if someone is underperforming, and we have provided feedback and there are a friends of mine, we are going to have a hard conversation.

427
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:03,500
Because factually there's a problem, and so I think that's also leads back to the family comment.

428
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,600
It's much harder to do that with family.

429
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,400
It's way easier to do that in a team setting.

430
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,800
And so, it is really about the dynamic of again, in Oro, City saying, you know, it's about the business.

431
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,800
I see it in three ways.

432
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:25,200
Actually, it's about the business, it's about the customers but the people do't work for the business and it doesn't work for the customer and it doesn't work for the rest of the people.

433
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:34,000
There's a problem and so that often helps remove the bias Factor just because you need to look at it from those three angles and not from any other ankle.

434
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:43,700
But yeah, it can be really difficult if you really close to someone, especially during the stage of the economy and for what companies are going through right now.

435
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,500
It's also super important always to like trust yourself.

436
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:56,100
Trust your instincts, look at the facts, but sometimes when you do know, there is a bias involved, you cannot just trust yourself.

437
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:13,100
Even if you think your objectively looking at the facts, I often think that there are times when it's really important to bring in a trusted Confidant or trusted Confidant who maybe are closer or have other contacts or other perspectives that are not skewed by your own personal biases, whatever that might be, that could be friendship.

438
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,400
That could be recency bias.

439
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:31,600
How recently, You started working with this person, whatever that might be you might need to get other qualitative opinions that are equally as important as the quantitative before making some kind of decision or whether that be positive or negative for somebody that you have a perceived friendship at work.

440
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:43,800
Now, the only thing that I would add to that too, is the importance of feedback loops, you know, be they Anonymous be, they, you know, providing a really safe place where people can come tell you directly.

441
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:50,500
Well I think that with that too is to everyone's Point making sure that we understand that.

442
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:56,300
That doesn't, that information doesn't may not necessarily control where we go, but it does provide context for it.

443
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,500
It's a data point.

444
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:04,300
It's something that we need to take in and self-reflect about and let that be, you know, add to the conversation that we're having in situations.

445
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,000
This is great.

446
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,300
All right, I am going to keep going through these questions.

447
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:21,000
We have one from Sarah and this is touching a question that we may have sort of answered earlier, but what are some of the top ways to facilitate bonding?

448
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:29,800
So if you were to identify, here's the top one, two, three things that are working right now, with my team, what are those things?

449
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:42,900
I will start, I think one to me is accessibility rodrigue or touched on it when it comes to introverts.

450
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,900
We have a whole world of difference at this stage, right?

451
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,800
No matter where you work.

452
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,300
There's a complete world of difference.

453
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,200
And so was that difference comes nearer, diversity.

454
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,200
Introverts and extroverts.

455
00:48:54,200 --> 00:49:02,500
It comes so many cultural differences that some folks might be comfortable with, and completely uncomfortable with, or not even normal in their cultural country.

456
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:15,500
And so on, I think it's really important that you have a fiery nicely documented process or I would lean into documentation have a guideline on how to do social connection.

457
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:22,400
One to create accessibility for all these amazing people, we have got V RF remote.

458
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,200
Not a lot of people enjoy it, but we do engineers really do enjoy it.

459
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:31,800
But they also have folks in our growth marketing team that really enjoys it and in the people team and another team's.

460
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,400
So I do see that as a completely different.

461
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:40,800
Bonding opportunity, they live in their Avatar and that's how they connect and bond, and they know each other's avatars.

462
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,800
And so making space for accessibility for those different groups and different individuals in your organization and different cultures.

463
00:49:48,100 --> 00:50:00,800
I think is incredibly important and my third one, I am going to lean in to say go lead by example, you have got a shot for that sharing being vulnerable at executive leadership level manager level.

464
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,900
And then with your peers, Yeah, I love that.

465
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:14,900
The only thing you didn't say they're Nadia that you have said before that I think is also equally important is remembering the personal details.

466
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:22,900
Like I really do think it is so important that if someone tells you something personal about your life like actually make an effort too intentionally.

467
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,600
Remember the pet's name, the partner's name, how many siblings?

468
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,600
They have whatever it is that they felt like sharing.

469
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,900
That's often an extreme moment of vulnerability at work.

470
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,600
So like don't take that for granted.

471
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,600
Absolutely.

472
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:42,700
I would also say like really setting the precedent of encouraging people to take it off of slack.

473
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,500
I think like we had a previous place.

474
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,700
I worked, we talked about like level one and level two conversations to we're level one.

475
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,700
It's just what happens every day like, you know, just back and forth.

476
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,800
And really it's anytime you have a communication that's not necessarily up for interpretation.

477
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:10,500
But anytime that goes above that hop on a call, you know, do a quick like, you know, Zoom meeting, you know, do use those funny little like chat features that Have in slack, you know, just because if you look at the statistics, I mean only 7% of communication actually happens.

478
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,100
Be of the words that are said, the rest of it is all tone and body language.

479
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:21,600
And so in the absence information we fill in the blanks and so really encouraging people to hop on those calls is really, really helpful.

480
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,000
And then, the other thing is really weaving it into the day-to-day.

481
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,700
Those finding those small ways for it to happen, and not relying on the big ways solely.

482
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:46,700
You know whether it's like, we're Going about, you know, in everyone saying remembering those details for when it comes to birthdays, you know, doing those virtual backgrounds, like those small ways, add up quite a bit and especially if they're kind of happened again and again, and again in the fabric of the day.

483
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,600
So good, thank you, Dan mohel.

484
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,800
Has another question here, work-life balance question.

485
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:01,300
How do L Foster friendships, while not cutting into personal time?

486
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,700
This is what the idea I said, earlier, about forced fun.

487
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,800
I feel like and naughty.

488
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,000
I think I always knew this to you, I am so sorry.

489
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,500
Lord, I want you to always do not talk.

490
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,100
We always want to talk at the same time.

491
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,200
No, I prefer.

492
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,000
It is.

493
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:23,100
You go with this and I agree, so I am going to give yes, I think.

494
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:30,300
All right, and then we will hand it back to you because I am sure you're going to add on to it too, but I think the idea of forced fun is really difficult.

495
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:38,400
Like if you're forcing your team to join a happy hour during the time that they're usually putting their kids to better bed or trying to make dinner or something like that.

496
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:45,200
That's when you start showing that you're not making fun accessible and you're not making friendships accessible to these people.

497
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,900
We have to be thoughtful about cultivating relationships at work.

498
00:52:49,100 --> 00:53:00,100
During work hours and understanding that it's just as important to build space for culture and cultural and connection to be happening as it is for them to get projects done during work hours.

499
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:15,000
So you're making time for social behaviors, should not happen on the weekends or when these people have already set their, like, I am I don't take meetings during these hours types of things like you have to think about prioritizing these hours, while these folks are at work, how do I do natya?

500
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,400
Really, really well.

501
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,400
And like time zone inclusivity is a thing, right?

502
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:34,100
So exactly what you said, if, if you distribute a teams are hard and the one day I tend to stay away from for social activities, especially considering I have a lot of folks in a pack at remote is Friday's?

503
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,300
Just because if you're doing something on a Friday, you are eating into someone's weekend.

504
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,300
And that someone could be 10% of your organization.

505
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,000
It could be one.

506
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,100
It doesn't matter.

507
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,500
So I agree.

508
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:53,800
I think what it comes to time zones and this, like, not cutting into personal time, it is about sharing the load.

509
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
If you join a company that is this distributed where I am at, you have got to understand.

510
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
There will be times when you have got to lean in, but there has to be times when the other person is going to lean into.

511
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,300
And that I share that feeling about social connection as well.

512
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:17,400
So maybe this week, we have a social time for very earlier mayor, Ed back overlap but next this week we're going to have a man.

513
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,400
Erica saw the lab.

514
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:29,800
So I think it is a little bit about sharing the experience and knowing that it is going to be different part of the future of work, but time zone inclusivity is so important.

515
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,500
Scheduling something at someone's 6 AM is going to be awful.

516
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,500
They are not going to show up excited and ready for a beard happy hour.

517
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,100
So they'd much rather have a coffee.

518
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,400
So yeah, I agree.

519
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,300
Yeah.

520
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,200
You know, I have actually always struggled with that term work-life balance.

521
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,200
I have always found it.

522
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:56,600
Much healthier to view it as a work-life rhythm, because balance.

523
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,300
Always, you know, it communicates.

524
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,400
Everything is always the same.

525
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,400
Everything is always static and that isn't true.

526
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,300
You know, it's like you think about, like, what makes a song?

527
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:03,900
Good.

528
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,900
Sometimes it goes fast, sometimes they go-slow.

529
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:23,500
But that's actually what makes it that rhythm is, what makes it, you know, a good song and understanding those rhythms of our life, like we have had again like As everyone's, you know, alluded to like my on my team were across like a bunch of different time zones, and we have to understand everyone's rhythms.

530
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:30,000
I remember when I was joining the team, it was right as I was about to become a new father for the first time.

531
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:37,400
And I was talking to one of my co-workers and I remember when she was asking me how I felt about it and, you know, said a bunch of stuff in somewhere in there.

532
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:43,200
I said, I just want to make sure it doesn't disrupt my work, and she said, hey, stop right there because that's the wrong way to view it.

533
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:48,000
It's like, because we really have come to see that It's just all continuous like it's all part of the same thing.

534
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,800
There's going to be times when your kiddo is going to cry and you need to get up and you know go be with your kid over there, going to just jump in the middle of a meeting.

535
00:55:55,100 --> 00:56:01,100
And having that Grace in awareness of each other's Rhythm, has proved Monumental and how we engage with each other.

536
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:03,900
Wow.

537
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,700
So rich.

538
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:09,100
I feel like we could continue talking for another hour, but believe it or not.

539
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,900
We have 5 minutes left with our time together.

540
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:22,100
And the questions have come through All the insights have that have been shared are so amazing, you know, one question that I still have that.

541
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,300
I just quickly wanted to go around with is are there any tools?

542
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,400
Are there any processes?

543
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:41,400
We have touched a lot of different ideas here, but are there any tactical tools that you see teams can start using today to be able to build productive, strong relationships?

544
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,600
I think we have said a lot of them and I do think a lot of them are like the obvious ones, like it's like Zoom.

545
00:56:50,600 --> 00:57:00,700
Like, do take things off slack to Rodrigo's Point earlier, like bring your body language and your face and how you're trying to communicate things, especially if it could be easily.

546
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:07,200
Misinterpreted, if you're delivering hard news, if it's something that requires like decision-making, like, don't have that.

547
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,200
Be an asynchronous communication like think about other ways that you can personalize it shames.

548
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:22,800
Self promotion of loom once again, but I do think that bringing like your face and your body language and your tone to what you're saying is super, super important, and we tend to get really lost in slack.

549
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,800
A lot of the time.

550
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:29,400
I also think there are fantastic tools to Nadia's point about creating these channels where you're giving shoutouts.

551
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:42,200
There are tools like bonus lie that exists, where every person at your company gets, you know, ten to twenty dollars a month, and they're able to give those dollars out as think use or congratulations or celebrating people.

552
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:53,700
Apple, it's a fantastic way to build and drive culture and its way that your tangibly making more money or like getting bonuses for doing good deeds or for connecting with people or for helping out a pier.

553
00:57:53,900 --> 00:58:03,100
And I think that not only helps Inspire like connection like these moments of recognition for folks but it also just creates a more collaborative and inclusive work environment.

554
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,900
We love bonus lie, we use it as well and Loom.

555
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:12,400
Yeah, I think to Laura's point we have mentioned a ton.

556
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,200
I know when that we use a lot is whisk.

557
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:28,700
It's like a social network that specifically tailored around work, but one of the things I keep coming back to is like I am reminded of like, you know, when the space race was first happening to the Moon, you know, like they had to solve the problem of, how do you write in you know, zero gravity, you know, in the u.s.

558
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:34,300
Spent like millions of dollars and thousands of man-hours building a pen that can write a 0?

559
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:41,700
In the Russians, just use the pencil and sometimes like the simplest approach is the easiest, you know, and it's right in front of our face.

560
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:59,000
Be, they emojis be, they virtual backgrounds be they everything that we have talked about today don't feel the need to always have to rely on that Silver, Bullet of Technology when you know because that oftentimes the Vols money and involves time and it's okay to, you know, to use the products that you have.

561
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,200
And yes, Laura, that's actually how I fell in love with loom.

562
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,200
Is that same thing?

563
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,200
Sad.

564
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:16,500
Say I will add one thing that's going to nearly take this on a different straight but just like a thought the more integration and automation you do no matter what team you have.

565
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:21,300
People team like any team that's doing tactical, operational administrative work.

566
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:26,900
If you can use the right Tech tools to integrate and automate those stuff so that no one is sitting and doing data.

567
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,800
Capturing, there is so much more time for engagement.

568
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,100
I find that especially in the people team.

569
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:47,600
So what I find is, if I do that and get rid of like uman data, capturing very heavy, administrative tasks, my team can have space to be more creative and show up for Theory engaging conversations.

570
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,800
But this is not just the people team, it's across the whole book.

571
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:57,000
So I love HR, Tech and integrating an automating stuff, and leaning on my Engineers for help.

572
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:06,900
Love it and I think Laura you summed it and chat, you can't automate human connection, it's got to be manual, it's got to be intentional.

573
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,900
So with that, we're going to wrap up our time.

574
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,000
Thank you so much.

575
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:19,300
Nadia Laura Rodrigo, for sharing your time, your insights, your presence with us today.

576
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:25,500
Thank you everybody who attended in chat, your engagement, you have been present with us as well.

577
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:34,300

578
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:42,300
You know check out we have got a couple of other Spotlight interviews that we're going to be doing over the next few weeks.

579
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:48,300
And we have got Alex from first base Brooke from Loom and Mattea from tight form.

580
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:55,700
And we're going to dive deep actually into their stories and journeys of how they got to doing what they do in B2B marketing.

581
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:03,200
And also here, there Their expertise and wisdom in what they're learning is working with not working in their practices.

582
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:10,200
So with that thank you all so much and I look forward to seeing you at our next event.

583
