11
00:19:14,758 --> 00:19:35,558
As we know, and in fact, forty-seven point four million people voluntarily left their jobs in 2021, and we're finding that, you know, 78% of Industry professionals found that Group coaching could very well be extremely helpful during a lot of the Chan change management that we're all going through.

12
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:38,258

00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:40,958

00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:42,458
So, Gina is on the island in the Pacific.

51
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,358
I am gonna Iving in the Atlantic.

52
00:21:44,858 --> 00:21:49,658
So, my time is 1:00 PM Eastern, and I am on the opposite of an island.

53
00:21:49,658 --> 00:22:01,758
I am in the Prairies of Texas in Dallas, Texas, where there is nothing but flat land and nope, beautiful weather to be singing and it is 12:07 PM here.

54
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:10,058
Nice, I love that we can all tune in and be Completely different time zones like this and have such an amazing conversation together.

55
00:22:10,358 --> 00:22:13,758
So I am really excited to dive into this before we jump in.

56
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:21,858
Could each of you provide a quick little introduction of, you know what you're solving for today with your organization's?

57
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:24,258
What's top of mind, even?

58
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:26,958
Sure I am happy to go first.

59
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:32,658
So as you mentioned, I am the founder and CEO here at lingo live and at lingo live.

60
00:22:32,758 --> 00:22:39,758
Our mission is to connect the world and Empower people to contribute their unique potential at work.

61
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:50,658
And so we do that by unlocking that potential through the transformative power of one-on-one coaching which I know we're going to talk a little bit about how we do that coaching skills based coaching.

62
00:22:50,658 --> 00:22:55,458
So I won't kind of ruin that surprised now but at a high level that's what we do.

63
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:58,658
Thanks, Tyler Roberto good.

64
00:22:58,758 --> 00:22:59,658
Fantastics yet.

65
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:01,858
My name is Roberto CEO.

66
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:03,358
Co-founder of welcome.

67
00:23:03,358 --> 00:23:05,958
Welcome is the platform that you're on, so welcome to welcome.

68
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:13,258
What we focus on is helping companies gather and Inspire their distributed Workforce right now.

69
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:16,458
More than ever before, folks are located around the world.

70
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:26,158
Hence, even the intro of this conversation and what we're doing is partnering with organizations that are driving more intentional, Gatherings across their employees.

71
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:36,058
Life cycle from onboarding to town halls to Learning and Development to social, diversity and Community groups as well on the platform.

72
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:38,458
So that's what we do on our side.

73
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:40,058
Awesome.

74
00:23:41,058 --> 00:23:41,858
Thanks for weirdo.

75
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,058
Okay.

76
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:57,758
So Doom Loop, you know that was part of our title here where we want to break this corporate Doom Loop, and I am just curious as in chat, have you all heard of this term ERM Doom Loop.

77
00:23:57,758 --> 00:24:00,058
If you have just, just let us know.

78
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:02,158
Because Tyler could you help?

79
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:06,358
Explain, you know, what is this Doom Loop cycle?

80
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:08,558
And why is it affecting?

81
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:09,658
Oh, no, not really.

82
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:11,258
Okay, Joe hasn't heard of it.

83
00:24:11,258 --> 00:24:13,758
And anyone else, if you have heard of it, let us know.

84
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:14,958
That's okay.

85
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:15,958
Joe, I hadn't heard of it.

86
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,458
Either until our marketing team, came up with it.

87
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:23,858
I thought it was a really brilliant way of putting it, which is so basically, what's the Doom Loop?

88
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:24,358
The Doom Loops.

89
00:24:24,358 --> 00:24:29,958
Is this idea that As you mentioned before the voluntary, turnover, that happens?

90
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,758
So, what's happening there?

91
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:33,158
Why are people leaving companies?

92
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:34,058
They're leaving companies?

93
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:38,158
Not because of their role or the company, they're leaving companies because of their boss.

94
00:24:38,158 --> 00:25:00,958
So three out of four employees who leave a company voluntarily, they do that because they basically have a bad manager and so what that leads to is you know obviously a cost and a drop in revenue for the organization which then prevents those companies from being able to invest in management, which then starts the cycle all over again.

95
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:06,258
So, that's the concept of the Doom Loop bad managers lead to Employees leaving, which drops Revenue hurts.

96
00:25:06,258 --> 00:25:09,958
Your cash, prevents you from being able to invest and improving those managers.

97
00:25:12,358 --> 00:25:13,058
Gotcha.

98
00:25:13,258 --> 00:25:14,958
Okay, I didn't know.

99
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:20,258
It was a marketing term that I thought it was actually like an industry term.

100
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:22,058
Well, I think it is, but I hadn't heard of it.

101
00:25:22,058 --> 00:25:25,358
I am saying to Joe like I, yeah, I hadn't heard of it.

102
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:26,458
Put that watch.

103
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,658
Uh, it totally makes sense.

104
00:25:28,858 --> 00:25:36,758
I mean, if you even layer on the post, pandemic burnout that everyone is experiencing those.

105
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:42,058
Managers may also be burnt out themselves And, you know, could result.

106
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:44,258
So, it's like, how do we come around?

107
00:25:44,258 --> 00:25:48,658
That manager is, is the big opportunity here, Rob?

108
00:25:48,658 --> 00:25:53,558
Did you have any other thoughts to know what you're seeing with doom loops?

109
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:58,058
And you know, the management eating this support?

110
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,058
Yeah, yeah, no doubt.

111
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:04,958
So yeah, Doom Loop was new to me as well, but it completely makes sense to describe.

112
00:26:05,258 --> 00:26:15,258
I think that cycle of like what's happening right now and I just now in the industry but for a long Time like folks are, you know, Sister pandemic.

113
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:16,858
People have just really started.

114
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:23,158
Taking inventory of the work, they do who they work with, we're doing work from.

115
00:26:24,158 --> 00:26:29,458
And in that inventory, they're making decisions to change, right?

116
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:39,458
Organizations that are not invested in those employee experiences and invested in the key managers who drive in pole experiences.

117
00:26:40,958 --> 00:27:06,758
A hard time, have a hard time retaining talent because of that, I think one of the things that we're going to find, and I am looking forward to this conversation, is the important of even middle managers, like folks that are in chat folks that are joining us as we were streaming here, managers are having to not just carry the weight of an organization because they understand sort of the mile markers that benchmarks of goals that they have to go ahead.

118
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:10,358
And then have to drive and coach your team to get there.

119
00:27:11,158 --> 00:27:16,458
But they were also dealing with employees that are going through hardships.

120
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:20,858
And over the last few years, it's been really hard for all of us.

121
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:21,458
Right?

122
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:27,358
Personally and professionally and even given the certain the current like market conditions.

123
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:31,458
There's a lot of thrashing.

124
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:45,858
I would say right now just at the employee level at company level and the middle manager that manager not just has to show up to get results and I have an outcome but also to show up in coach and drive culture for their team.

125
00:27:46,258 --> 00:27:56,858
And so that middle manager, I think if we had a focus of put a focus on people within a company middle managers are carrying a lot of weight today.

126
00:27:56,958 --> 00:28:02,658
And, so I am glad that were talking about how this, how do we support managers and Leaders with coaching?

127
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:04,658
What is this coaching actually lead to?

128
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:10,558
What kind of outcomes can actually drive for the organization and so yeah, I am looking forward to the combo.

129
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,458
Yeah, just to add to that Roberta.

130
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:16,358
I think it's really important to, to capture the scale of the problem.

131
00:28:16,358 --> 00:28:18,658
Like, I think everyone can buy into like yeah, that's an issue.

132
00:28:18,658 --> 00:28:19,558
We should solve it.

133
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:25,958
But you know, when Gina mentions the statistics around voluntary, turnover, this is last year alone.

134
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:27,058
It cost the US economy.

135
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:39,158
A trillion dollars, a trillion dollars wasted due to voluntary turnover because you have to spend money often times as much as 2 times the salary of the person who left.

136
00:28:39,158 --> 00:28:46,058
And so, if you're a company with 100 employees, He's the Bureau of Labor and statistics, going to say, you're going to lose, 26 of those employees.

137
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,358
Every year.

138
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:52,258
That's 2.6 million dollars that you're paying as an organization to replace those employees.

139
00:28:52,258 --> 00:29:01,358
Like, most of us that are working at companies with 100 people, you can't afford to spend 2.6 million dollars so it is a very big, you know, national issue.

140
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:06,258
So let us jump into skills based coaching.

141
00:29:06,758 --> 00:29:09,558
How is that different from regular coaching?

142
00:29:09,658 --> 00:29:12,858
You know, I think there's, like General coaching that people are aware of.

143
00:29:12,858 --> 00:29:17,358
But when it comes to skills based coaching, how do you define that Tyler?

144
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:23,758
And how do we see that as possibly a huge solution to some of these problems were talking about?

145
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:30,458
Yeah, so basically you know the way that companies are solving this problem which will get into like dif what is skills based coaching.

146
00:29:30,858 --> 00:29:36,358
So companies acknowledge this issue trillion dollars And so the way that they're solving it is their Learning and Development.

147
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:39,158
Teams are putting together training programs to say.

148
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:46,858
Okay when we have got to upscale our managers let us figure out what skills really matter to be a leader at lingo live or welcome.

149
00:29:46,858 --> 00:29:54,658
Like what does that mean, leading effectively at this company, so they codify some skills that they want to focus on, and then they train their managers on those skills.

150
00:29:55,258 --> 00:30:00,358
And usually that happens in like a group setting where it's kind of like instructor-led training.

151
00:30:00,658 --> 00:30:04,558
Maybe there's some coaching circles where people kind of Share what they thought about.

152
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:22,558
But unless you can provide the kind of safe space for someone to work out what these things mean for them and how they can actually embody these skills, you're not going to see meaningful Behavior change, you're going to get people who is a kind of learn some things, and they keep it in the back of their head.

153
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:24,158
But they're not really embodying this.

154
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:29,758
So, if you think about a skill like having difficult conversations, that's like such a classic skill.

155
00:30:30,658 --> 00:30:41,958
You can run a training around crucial Relations you can train people on Frameworks for things like Behavior and the impact of that behavior and then asking someone a question, right?

156
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:54,058
Like you can give them these Concepts but unless you provide the environment for them to be able to practice those things and really contextualize, what does this mean for me in my job?

157
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:55,558
And who I am as a person?

158
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:59,458
It's not going to become ingrained and how they show up.

159
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:05,358
And so that's what skills based coaching is, is the idea of Partnering with you as an organization to identify?

160
00:31:05,358 --> 00:31:13,158
What are the skills that you're training these leaders on and giving you what, you don't have the scale to be able to provide, which is personalized coaching.

161
00:31:13,358 --> 00:31:15,158
It's catered to those skills.

162
00:31:15,158 --> 00:31:20,658
So that these folks can actually contextualize them and start to embody them as a regular part of their identity as a leader.

163
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:28,858
And how that's different from traditional coaching is a little bit more open-ended, where it's kind of like you.

164
00:31:28,858 --> 00:31:32,458
Every single individual might be working on their own things.

165
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:36,558
You show up when you need the coach, you kind of talk about what's top of Mind.

166
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:44,258
Our skills based coaching is very much focused on a specific goal that you're trying to tackle skills that matter to your organization.

167
00:31:44,258 --> 00:31:50,958
That's going to help you achieve that goal in the accountability that we put in place through our applied learning model to make sure that you're actually applying.

168
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:52,358
Things in the workplace.

169
00:31:54,358 --> 00:31:55,658
That's really good.

170
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:58,658
Thank you for waiting, Tyler.

171
00:31:58,658 --> 00:32:00,658
I just want to hit on the last point you mentioned.

172
00:32:00,658 --> 00:32:06,358
There are around accountability, how many of us get something done?

173
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:09,258
When there's a deadline most of us do, right?

174
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:17,458
Or we have to show up to a meeting and present something because somebody is expecting that you're going to have something done by a certain point in time.

175
00:32:17,758 --> 00:32:22,958
I think one of the most powerful things about coaching is the accountability that comes with that, right?

176
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:23,958
Not just like meeting.

177
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:38,158
One mapping out the gaps to go work on but and then it's like, hey, in two weeks, we're going to huddle up again for 30 minutes, and we should review that plan which will review that strategy we should check on the progress that you're making.

178
00:32:38,658 --> 00:32:54,058
I mean, I think that even Beyond managers even like employees, everyone that's listening to the call here, like there is something to be said around just accountability in general and mapping out the gaps that we want to go with.

179
00:32:54,158 --> 00:32:57,158
Steve individually right at work or in life.

180
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:04,258
And I always found that accountability when it comes to coaching is one of those key is one of the most part.

181
00:33:04,258 --> 00:33:05,658
Most powerful things about that.

182
00:33:05,658 --> 00:33:09,958
Dynamic, within coach is, hey, we're in this relationship.

183
00:33:10,358 --> 00:33:11,258
I am here to learn.

184
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:17,158
I am here to grow, your helping me, figure this stuff out, but also you're holding me accountable to get those things done.

185
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:23,358
Which, which I think is a big part of the how, how do you see that play out, you know, in the work that you're doing?

186
00:33:23,358 --> 00:33:24,058
How important?

187
00:33:24,158 --> 00:33:27,158
Is not an ability that can you just like set it goes?

188
00:33:27,158 --> 00:33:28,558
And it's kind of, leave it lofty.

189
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:33,358
And how effective is it when you actually have the follow-ups with someone on the team?

190
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:44,358
Yeah, so we have actually caught a fide that as a part of our learning methodology, in a part of our program, you're going to meet with your coach, you're going to work on some skills, like, again, it's a difficult conversation.

191
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:47,158
Maybe your company train, you on some Frameworks.

192
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:53,058
But now you have literally got a difficult conversation tomorrow Friday with one of your car for two weeks.

193
00:33:53,258 --> 00:34:02,558
Yeah, right, you're going To practice this thing with your coach, but then what we have codified is like homework in our program is an action step where the coach is going to say, Tyler.

194
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:13,058
We practice this, you know, we noticed how your imposter syndrome flares up when you're in this situation, take note of that, that's your homework between now.

195
00:34:13,058 --> 00:34:23,558
And next week, when we meet next Thursday, I want you to take note of like when that imposter syndrome flares up, I want you to write that down and next Thursday, when we meet, I am going to ask you about that.

196
00:34:23,558 --> 00:34:27,858
So that gets Put into the system, you get that as an email, as a homework assignment basically.

197
00:34:28,058 --> 00:34:33,257
And then when you start your session with your coach, the next week, they're going to check in on that and be like hey did you do that thing?

198
00:34:33,558 --> 00:34:33,958
What was that?

199
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:44,158
Like so that's where we're trying to use technology to kind of codify what the accountability is that you need to own and empower the coach to remember like oh yeah, because they have many coaches.

200
00:34:44,158 --> 00:34:46,658
He's like, oh yeah this is what Tyler's working on.

201
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,458
I am going to hold them accountable for this.

202
00:34:50,257 --> 00:35:00,158
Can you sort of break down the process of even how you would go about, to start a skills-based coaching program?

203
00:35:00,158 --> 00:35:08,458
If you will with a manager like, how does that the goal from the goal setting to the accountability that you're describing?

204
00:35:09,058 --> 00:35:10,958
Can you just walk us through some of those phases?

205
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:11,958
Sure.

206
00:35:12,558 --> 00:35:18,558
So the first phase is working with your organization to really understand what are the skills that you're training your leaders on.

207
00:35:18,558 --> 00:35:24,058
And why what are the There's their showing up in your organization today that you don't like what are the behaviors?

208
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:25,358
Give us some examples of that.

209
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:26,558
Like what is that?

210
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,658
Yeah, looks like common example.

211
00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:38,958
Common example we hear is hey we're growing 40 percent year over year, and so we're promoting a lot of people in the management who don't have experience in management.

212
00:35:39,158 --> 00:35:57,258
So a lot of the behaviors are showing up, are you know, they're nice, they're really nice to their team, but they're not really good at holding them accountable to Performance and outcomes, or they're telling their team what to do instead of coaching and developing them to allow the team to figure out what do they need to do.

213
00:35:57,558 --> 00:36:07,058
And so we do that kind of alignment at the organization level to understand some of the themes and the trends and create a custom coaching program that's going to address those themes.

214
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:24,358
But then what happens for the manager when they on board is we have 20 different leadership skills in our catalog that we built with leading experts on leadership development and you go through that and start to indicate what do Thinker some of my biggest strengths and then some of my biggest growth opportunities.

215
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:33,258
And then we also asked you to ask your team, so you send a survey to your manager and your direct reports in your peers to do the same thing.

216
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:39,058
So that you get this holistic perspective of how people see you as a leader, both strengths and weaknesses.

217
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:42,558
And that's great context for when you connect to a coach.

218
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:47,958
So obviously, we have a matching algorithm, you can find a coach that aligns with your availability in your skills.

219
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:59,558
But when you meet with that coach, they have got This context, not just from you but from your team around kind of what do, what do you and your team, feel your strong at and what our growth opportunities so that you can kind of talk through that.

220
00:36:59,858 --> 00:37:05,558
And then set a very specific goal that for you is going to be meaningful in the next four to six weeks.

221
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:07,858
I will pause there.

222
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,558
I mean that's just scratching the surface, but does that make sense?

223
00:37:10,558 --> 00:37:13,458
Like how we get kind of program launched in the managers?

224
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:14,558
On-boarded, with a coach?

225
00:37:15,058 --> 00:37:18,358
That's really great and to hear that you have identified.

226
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:24,158
You said 20 different common management, themes, what are some of those examples?

227
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:26,758
Yes, a we categorize these.

228
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:28,858
And by the way, I would be happy to share these.

229
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:35,958
Like, for any managers that are on this call that want to figure out how to improve their own self-awareness, which I know.

230
00:37:36,058 --> 00:37:37,058
No, you're big on.

231
00:37:37,058 --> 00:37:38,458
We're probably going to talk about.

232
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:40,758
We're happy to share our skills catalog.

233
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:49,658
Which I think as a manager one of the best things you can do is that exact same process where you survey your teammates and your manager to find out.

234
00:37:49,758 --> 00:37:51,558
Hey, here's these 20 leadership skills.

235
00:37:51,658 --> 00:37:54,158
What do you think I am strong at and what our growth opportunities?

236
00:37:54,558 --> 00:37:57,258
I think that's something that is hugely impactful for you.

237
00:37:57,258 --> 00:38:05,058
It just really turning the lights on outside of how you perceive yourself and kind of how your team perceives yourself.

238
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:10,858
But the skills themselves, I won't go into all 20, but there's basically five categories of skills.

239
00:38:11,558 --> 00:38:25,158
The first is communication skills, so things like active listening, I mentioned before managers are telling your team what to do instead of coaching them stop talking, ask questions and really actively, listen to what the answers are.

240
00:38:25,158 --> 00:38:29,258
And why this person saying that the second category is emotional intelligence.

241
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:38,058
So, being open is an example of a skill in emotional intelligence, being curious, being empathetic, like, Our emotional intelligence skills.

242
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:43,058
Probably the most important category, to be honest, the third is people skills.

243
00:38:43,158 --> 00:38:49,458
So having difficult conversations, is this skill in the people skills, the fourth is performance.

244
00:38:49,758 --> 00:39:01,858
So ensuring accountability or planning and directing work is an example of skills in the performance category and then the last is thought, like actual critical, thinking stop so much time.

245
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:04,658
We spend so much time, just working banging on keyboards or opening.

246
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:15,858
Google Docs responding to It was like, you need to think you need to set aside some time if you're really in a leadership position to stop doing and start thinking about kind of what is it that you need to be doing.

247
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:18,358
So, those are the five categories of skills.

248
00:39:18,758 --> 00:39:19,658
That's great.

249
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:23,458
I just dropped it in chat as well, and we would love to see that catalog.

250
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:30,058
So if somebody could drop that in chat, or we will have a post-event follow-up email, so we could drop the link in there as well.

251
00:39:30,558 --> 00:39:32,658
Perfect, that's great.

252
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:33,758
Rob.

253
00:39:33,758 --> 00:39:38,558
Did you have anything to add I am just taking notes over here now.

254
00:39:38,558 --> 00:39:40,158
It's all right, it's just stuff.

255
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:55,958
I think, I think one of those, you know, when we talk about Communication in general and I think, when you think about perform, all of them, all five of those, you know, for a manager to be able to show up and say, like, how am I successful?

256
00:39:56,058 --> 00:39:58,958
Like, how like my role as a manager?

257
00:39:59,658 --> 00:40:00,758
What does success look like?

258
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:06,558
And a lot of times, you know, we get caught up in the attic, Tyler you mentioned As well.

259
00:40:06,558 --> 00:40:10,858
It's like, well, I want to drive culture, which is amazing.

260
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:13,958
That's a, that's a big priority for team at the team level.

261
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:17,958
Make sure that there's a healthy Dynamic within, within a team within your team.

262
00:40:19,058 --> 00:40:34,058
But then I think performance is one of those things where if we're not really clear on the expectations of what an employee success looks like, then it's hard to actually see progression and have good conversations and feedback around those things, right?

263
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:37,258
It's something that For me, it's like one of those things.

264
00:40:37,258 --> 00:40:46,058
Like when you're running so fast, You intentionally are because you're running so fast.

265
00:40:46,058 --> 00:40:53,458
You intensively dismiss the importance of sitting down and check it in and asking the questions of how are you doing?

266
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:54,658
Are you be clear?

267
00:40:54,758 --> 00:40:57,658
Do you understand what we are expecting XYZ?

268
00:40:57,658 --> 00:41:02,158
Because sometimes, you're running so fast and high growth company that you take those things for granted.

269
00:41:02,158 --> 00:41:09,658
And as a manager, you might think that's okay, but at the employee level, they're craving, that they're craving.

270
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:14,158
That level of feedback, you're craving that level of clarity, they're craving.

271
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:20,758
Even the growth that comes from the performance that the output that they're having.

272
00:41:20,858 --> 00:41:23,258
What does that look like for me a year or two years?

273
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:27,558
Three years and a lot of times we're so caught up back to your point.

274
00:41:27,558 --> 00:41:39,558
Tyler, we're so focused in the now that we don't take a step back not just on the Strategic level, but also just on the manager level and checking in on our people, to make sure that they're good right across all.

275
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:40,958
Those spectrums.

276
00:41:41,058 --> 00:41:43,058
And so, yeah, I will put it on my side.

277
00:41:43,058 --> 00:41:49,458
I am just like taking notes on my side so, you can we yeah, like, taking mental notes here.

278
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,758
I will probably watch this recording over and over again.

279
00:41:54,158 --> 00:41:54,558
That's right.

280
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:57,858
It's really hard work like for anybody.

281
00:41:57,858 --> 00:42:02,958
That's like okay, it's easier said than done like I am with you, I run a company that does this and I struggle with it.

282
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:23,158
So, like to be clear, it's not like, okay, cool, there're some skills, you just need to like work on those skills and then you're good like know, you spend your whole life trying to get better at these things because we're not hardwired as human beings to do things like the naturally inquisitive or to, you know, not view a threat when there's just conflict.

283
00:42:23,258 --> 00:42:26,558
And it could be healthy conflict but you perceive it as a threat like we are.

284
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:28,458
We are not hired are hard wired this way.

285
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:48,958
And so you have got to work on it and you got to be patient with it and know that it's a marathon, not a Sprint and view success as the progress that you make, not as being this like Exemplar leader that, you know, everybody looks up to because it just it's going to take forever to get there and that's okay, it's either one thing just to follow up on that.

286
00:42:49,058 --> 00:42:53,158
Like, if we go back to tough conversations, that was an example.

287
00:42:53,258 --> 00:42:53,758
For that.

288
00:42:53,758 --> 00:43:06,558
You put forward managers and leaders always have to have tough conversations, no doubt, and then any employee on the other side is trying to make sense of those conversations as well.

289
00:43:06,858 --> 00:43:23,858
What are some, some key things that some folks can if someone is having tough conversation next week, Both from a manager perspective and also from employee perspective, what is a healthy structure or dynamic to go into those tough conversations with?

290
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:28,858
Well, I think the biggest thing is self-awareness like how are you doing?

291
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:38,658
As you go into that conversation as a manager as an employee whatever, self-awareness in terms of understanding the energy that you're coming in with.

292
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:41,458
So I am a, I am a big fan of meditation and mindfulness.

293
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:48,658
I think that's really powerful and helping you kind of tap into what's going on internally with me and you can do that for five minutes before.

294
00:43:48,858 --> 00:43:56,758
One on one, we're about to have that conversation, just put away the slack, close the laptop, breathe for five minutes and just kind of take stock of where you're at.

295
00:43:56,858 --> 00:43:58,658
I think that's super important.

296
00:43:59,158 --> 00:44:05,658
The other thing is then to, when you're delivering feedback, I mentioned this before.

297
00:44:05,658 --> 00:44:09,458
There's a framework, and we have partnered with the team at Life Labs learning.

298
00:44:09,758 --> 00:44:19,158
They kind of launched this framework that I think is really helpful, which is behavior impact and then a question biq.

299
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:23,058
So, here's a behavior, I noticed.

300
00:44:23,258 --> 00:44:37,158
Here's the impact, That had and then a question that you asked them, so an example of that could be and it can't be a you know, subjective thing and has to be like an actual thing that happened in a meeting.

301
00:44:37,158 --> 00:44:47,858
So in a meeting I noticed that you cut off Roberto think the impact of that is that he felt like his input wasn't very warranted.

302
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:49,258
How does that make you feel?

303
00:44:49,258 --> 00:44:50,458
Hearing that feedback for me?

304
00:44:50,458 --> 00:45:01,958
That's Behavior impact question and I think the questions probably the most important part because you're opening the door to the fact that like, this is my perception.

305
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:03,158
It's not a fact.

306
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:07,258
It's not like stamping you with this and you are bad, and I am good.

307
00:45:07,258 --> 00:45:13,458
It's like I am it's my job as your manager to give you feedback but at the same time I am open to hearing your reaction and your thoughts on this.

308
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:16,158
I think questions really important figuring out.

309
00:45:16,258 --> 00:45:17,558
However, you're going to say it.

310
00:45:17,558 --> 00:45:24,058
Make sure your objective and then make sure you end with a question instead of a definitive statement.

311
00:45:24,058 --> 00:45:29,558
So that you Make the other person feel free to kind of share how they feel and what their reaction is to it.

312
00:45:31,258 --> 00:45:32,658
That's good, that's really good.

313
00:45:33,158 --> 00:45:34,458
I like that quite a bit.

314
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:35,858
It's one of those things.

315
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:42,958
If you don't have a framework, you go into those conversations and, you know, it can get personal really fast.

316
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:47,558
We're both for you, and the individual versus I am being focused on.

317
00:45:47,558 --> 00:45:50,358
Hey, this happened to this is the impact.

318
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:51,958
Let us have a conversation around it.

319
00:45:52,358 --> 00:46:00,658
It removes the person personally from it, but the actual thing that happened, right, right.

320
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:11,358
But what you just touch on Roberto, I think is really important, just because you prepared and you got Mindful and you followed that framework doesn't mean that things aren't going to go off the rails.

321
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:13,458
They totally can and it can be emotional.

322
00:46:13,758 --> 00:46:20,758
And, so I think that's important too is to when if and when that happens be comfortable to saying hey let us pause here.

323
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:24,558
Like this is not right, we're not heading in a healthy direction and that's okay.

324
00:46:24,858 --> 00:46:28,758
Let us pause, let us just kind of, you know, leave it for later.

325
00:46:28,758 --> 00:46:30,158
Let us come back and revisit this.

326
00:46:30,658 --> 00:46:33,358
But I think, you know, let us move on to the next topic.

327
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:33,958
That's okay.

328
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:38,458
We don't need to get into this kind of back and forth where it's starting to get toxic.

329
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:44,258
I think that's another key part of being aware of That's good.

330
00:46:45,158 --> 00:46:49,658
If anybody has questions again, feel free to drop them in the Q&A tab as well.

331
00:46:49,758 --> 00:46:52,058
Y'all have never been in these situations, right Roberto?

332
00:46:55,258 --> 00:46:58,658
Yeah.

333
00:46:58,858 --> 00:46:59,558
No it's real.

334
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:00,458
It's real.

335
00:47:01,158 --> 00:47:14,958
I think that self-awareness point is really good and at as managers How can we improve in making sure to take that inventory?

336
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:24,158
Pulse check of where we are at, as we're running really fast with the things that need to get done and driving on performance so on and so forth.

337
00:47:24,158 --> 00:47:39,258
Not only for our teams of for ourselves everything that Roberto had described earlier, the pressures that have manager could be experiencing how do you have any Frameworks or any ways that a manager could just like paws?

338
00:47:39,558 --> 00:47:41,858
And take a self-awareness inventory.

339
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:47,858
Check You want me to tackle this one Roberto or I mean?

340
00:47:48,258 --> 00:47:50,058
Yeah, I will follow on from you.

341
00:47:50,058 --> 00:47:52,158
Just, I don't have all the answers here.

342
00:47:52,158 --> 00:47:57,258
I just know that, you know, for me, it's, it's really interesting, right?

343
00:47:57,258 --> 00:48:05,558
So if we look, if I look back at my career right, working as an individual contributor for a long time, then stepping into manager Rose.

344
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:12,358
And then now running a company like thinks changes at every step of that Journey quite a bit right.

345
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:18,558
But I think the going back to the self-awareness Gina you teed it up in?

346
00:48:18,558 --> 00:48:18,858
Tyler.

347
00:48:18,858 --> 00:48:39,358
We talked about this before, I think it's really and also just considering personal versus professional, I think we take inventory and say, look, if I am growing, as a manager, if I am trying to drive my career in this way and grow, that means that I my responsibilities are going to drive different skills that are required.

348
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:48,558
You know, one of my mentors said, hey, you know, a company can be growing exponentially like this far enough to the right, but people don't grow that way.

349
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:51,258
People don't grow that way at that speed.

350
00:48:51,258 --> 00:48:53,258
Is much more gradual, right?

351
00:48:53,258 --> 00:49:02,858
And so there's going to be a gap of like, hey my job or this season that we're in the, the company, the organization is requiring.

352
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:03,958
This I am here.

353
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:10,058
Now, self-awareness is saying there are some gaps between here and getting to this point of wearing.

354
00:49:10,258 --> 00:49:11,158
To be functioning.

355
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:12,658
How do I fill that Gap?

356
00:49:12,858 --> 00:49:18,958
But if we don't take inventory and say what is like, what are those gaps going back to self-awareness?

357
00:49:19,158 --> 00:49:40,058
That we're going to continue to be here where the need is up here and that's a problem that's where conflicts in because at that point now it's like well you know my team needs me to be much more clear about performance objectives, feedback Cycles, all these different things because we're running at the speed and this is what it's required.

358
00:49:40,158 --> 00:49:47,458
Word versus where we were a year ago, two years ago, three years ago and that's how I think about it.

359
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:55,158
When it comes to self-awareness is like, okay, if I am growing and developing, my responsibilities are going as well with that.

360
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:58,758
What are the gaps in order to keep up with the responsibilities that I have?

361
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:00,758
So that I can drive the right outcomes.

362
00:50:00,758 --> 00:50:03,758
I just for the organization, but from my team as well.

363
00:50:04,158 --> 00:50:09,858
And if we don't do that, then I think it takes an ever toll on ourselves because we can feel there's a gap.

364
00:50:10,658 --> 00:50:15,658
But if we're not stopping to address the Gap, we're just continuing every single day.

365
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:19,958
Carrying the weight of that Gap with that Gap.

366
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:23,858
Brings to not just your team for yourself and the company that you're working.

367
00:50:23,858 --> 00:50:31,458
Like so that's what I think about when I think about self-awareness is like there is a lot of times you're just gaps that we're not aware of.

368
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:32,358
We might feel it.

369
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:38,958
Our managers might tell us about it, our employees, my signal it, but we don't stop and take inventory.

370
00:50:39,158 --> 00:50:40,058
Then we can't fill the gap.

371
00:50:40,858 --> 00:50:47,758
They might signal it, but they probably won't like that's again then we're not as human beings wired that way.

372
00:50:47,758 --> 00:50:58,658
And, so I think vulnerability is which gets talked about a lot and I think a lot of times people can hear vulnerability and think it's this kind of woo thing where you're going to be holding hands singing Kumbaya frying.

373
00:50:58,658 --> 00:51:11,158
I know vulnerability is like what I said like, Sending out a survey to your people and saying, hey, there's these leadership skills that I think are good embodiment of what a leader is.

374
00:51:11,158 --> 00:51:20,958
Can you share with me things that you think I do well and things that I could do a better job at like that's huge is to open that door 20, I am allowed to do that.

375
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:24,058
Like not only are you allowed to like, I need that to become a better leader.

376
00:51:24,058 --> 00:51:25,258
I need your input.

377
00:51:25,558 --> 00:51:32,458
That is huge, but I think the bigger thing is that kind of what you're talking about, Roberto like that.

378
00:51:32,658 --> 00:51:37,658
Duration that self-exploration and I think you need another human being to help you do that.

379
00:51:37,658 --> 00:51:41,258
Obviously, I am biased like a coat as a guy who built a coaching company.

380
00:51:41,258 --> 00:51:53,358
Like I think someone who has a vested interest in helping you figure out what these things mean for you, and how you show up and why you show up that way, is really, really important.

381
00:51:53,358 --> 00:52:01,658
And so coaches can be really impactful there, but if you can't get a coach, like, you know, you can work with those employees to say, Hey, you gave me this feedback.

382
00:52:01,658 --> 00:52:02,558
I really would love your help.

383
00:52:02,658 --> 00:52:04,458
Help like what are you seeing show up?

384
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:11,658
When you say I need to get better at you know being open let us say like can you share more about how am I showing up?

385
00:52:11,658 --> 00:52:15,258
Can you give instances this week and then shut up?

386
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:19,158
Do not try to defend it, do not try to explain why you did the thing, right?

387
00:52:19,158 --> 00:52:25,158
Like just ask questions understand what they think that's going to help you build your self awareness.

388
00:52:25,158 --> 00:52:30,158
Your goal is not to solve problems and help people really understand where you came from.

389
00:52:30,158 --> 00:52:31,558
Or what your intent was.

390
00:52:31,558 --> 00:52:36,758
Your goal is to In the impact of your behaviors and your actions, both positive and negative.

391
00:52:36,758 --> 00:52:44,858
So I think if you can kind of Orient, Orient yourself around that is like understanding not explaining or problem-solving, you're going to be in a good spot.

392
00:52:46,658 --> 00:52:48,358
I think that's key right there in Joe.

393
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:58,658
I see that you're also reinforcing Tyler that's like right on, you know, after the question it's like you can't come in with a solution already.

394
00:52:59,158 --> 00:53:09,058
You have to literally just, listen and Like you said, shut up and let the employee share, that honest, feedback.

395
00:53:09,158 --> 00:53:16,658
Sarah Brown is asking, what are some other examples of questions in your framework?

396
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:21,058
I mean I think it really depends on the scenario.

397
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:32,158
So my cinerea was like where someone you know, interrupted someone else during a meeting which I think is that example that I have heard before, but I will try and think of it.

398
00:53:32,558 --> 00:53:41,758
Another example, a question could be, I would say if you sense that the person is, you should, you know, speaking of self-awareness, be aware of, like, how is this Landing?

399
00:53:41,758 --> 00:53:44,958
When I talk about the behavior in the impact?

400
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:50,858
Do I feel like this person is kind of leaning in And if they are, then the question could be something?

401
00:53:50,858 --> 00:53:53,958
Like where do you think that comes from right?

402
00:53:54,558 --> 00:53:56,658
Like, why did you feel the need to do that?

403
00:53:56,658 --> 00:53:58,458
Where do you think that comes from versus?

404
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:06,158
If you feel like their like, you know, getting their knife out then it's like a question might be, you know, how's that Landing?

405
00:54:06,158 --> 00:54:10,058
When you hear me say that or what's your perspective on the situation?

406
00:54:10,058 --> 00:54:12,758
Because I know, I am only giving part of the story.

407
00:54:12,758 --> 00:54:14,558
I would love to hear your perspective on it.

408
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:18,158
That's great.

409
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:20,558
Okay, looks like we have a question from Sal.

410
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:27,658
Jessica, if you don't mind pulling that on stage, what are some actual steps practices?

411
00:54:27,658 --> 00:54:33,758
One can take to improve empathy and general and workspace in specific?

412
00:54:37,458 --> 00:54:44,358
Yeah, I mean I think with empathy this has been a battle for me personally and professionally like I am somebody who is a problem.

413
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:47,158
Solver, I am kind of in a way a classic entrepreneur.

414
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,158
Like you give me a challenge.

415
00:54:48,158 --> 00:54:50,258
I am going to figure out how to solve that challenge.

416
00:54:50,258 --> 00:54:50,958
You give me a fire.

417
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,158
I am going to put it out or help.

418
00:54:53,158 --> 00:54:54,958
Get the team together to put it out.

419
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:58,158
And, so I think acknowledging that's not always your job.

420
00:54:58,158 --> 00:55:18,858
And Bethy is about just, I heard this quote, I apparently the Dalai Lama put it Sways is the difference between compassion and empathy is if you're on a hike and you see a man trapped under a boulder feeling their pain, right?

421
00:55:19,058 --> 00:55:22,058
Versus compassion is getting the boulder off of them.

422
00:55:22,258 --> 00:55:41,958
You know, it's like feeling their pain but at the same time, like solving the problem, and so I think understanding when you need to use each of those because sometimes they don't need their problem to be solved, sometimes they need to be heard, and they need to They need you to feel their pain with them but sometimes it's like, hey, this is not healthy for you or the organization.

423
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,758
So I am going to feel you.

424
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:51,158
I understand why this is, you know, painful but also let us get the boulder off you and let us figure out how we solve this problem.

425
00:55:51,158 --> 00:55:57,258
And so, I think figuring out which one is which comes down to trust and building a really solid relationship.

426
00:55:57,258 --> 00:56:04,458
Where, you know, this person and you kind of understand what they need, which is your job as a manager, like your job.

427
00:56:04,858 --> 00:56:09,558
To get better outcomes from a group of people working together.

428
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:12,458
That's, I have literally was looking at this today.

429
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:15,058
If y'all haven't read this book, The Making of a manager.

430
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:18,358
Yes, Julie's book, yes, Julie's book.

431
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:20,258
This is fantastic and she defines a manager.

432
00:56:20,258 --> 00:56:39,458
That way your job is to get better outcomes out of a group of people working together and you can't do that if you don't understand these people and who they are and what they need when it comes to kind of empathy versus Passion in the different circumstances that they face until you got to get to know them as people.

433
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:44,258
You can't just view your job is showing up getting status updates, telling them what they need to do.

434
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:50,758
And then ending you have gotta like cultivate a relationship understand what their biggest challenges are, why are they facing those challenges?

435
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:52,658
And then you will be able to figure out.

436
00:56:52,658 --> 00:56:57,758
Does this person need me to get under the boulder with them or do they need me to get the boulder off?

437
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:04,158
That's a really good distinction between empathy and compassion.

438
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:07,158
Kareem is actually making an interesting point there.

439
00:57:07,158 --> 00:57:18,258
The mere fact of asking rather than telling, and listening is a first step to building empathy, you know, making it about that other person and not about yourself.

440
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:24,958
So I think there's some great points, shared awesome.

441
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:27,458
So we were talking about that process.

442
00:57:27,658 --> 00:57:28,758
I would love to jump back.

443
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:30,358
Into, you know.

444
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:39,358
Now once we identify okay these are the goals and these are the things that we can improve on and the coaches identify to work with the manager.

445
00:57:39,658 --> 00:57:42,758
Now, what does that look like in accountability?

446
00:57:43,158 --> 00:57:43,558
Hmm.

447
00:57:44,258 --> 00:57:45,058
What is?

448
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:51,258
And today, let us say for those of us that are here, we don't have a coach, right?

449
00:57:51,658 --> 00:57:55,558
And let us say we need to solve these problems today.

450
00:57:55,758 --> 00:57:58,658
So what are some real practical things?

451
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:05,758
That we can do today to start, you know, you have helped us understand the identification process.

452
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:10,758
The self-awareness and vulnerability requires to ask the right questions.

453
00:58:10,758 --> 00:58:11,558
Get the feedback.

454
00:58:11,558 --> 00:58:13,458
Now how about accountability?

455
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:13,958
Yeah.

456
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:14,458
What is that?

457
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:22,658
Look like at a one-on-one level at A Team level, you know, the different touch points of interactions.

458
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:23,358
Sure.

459
00:58:24,058 --> 00:58:26,558
So I shared the skills catalog.

460
00:58:26,558 --> 00:58:52,158
I have seen some people are coming into it and I think Marines point is spot-on, like the mere fact of asking rather than telling what you can do after you have gotten that, even if you don't have a coach, let us say you have gotten that input from your team about things that you're strong at and things that our growth opportunities and how you can improve on the, on the on both really is you can come back to them, you should come back to them and ask, that's that accountability.

461
00:58:52,158 --> 00:58:56,958
Gina's, hey, you told me this for weeks ago that I need to get better at this thing.

462
00:58:57,258 --> 00:58:58,758
Here's some of the things I have been trying.

463
00:58:58,858 --> 00:58:59,958
And what have you noticed?

464
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:01,558
Like, be honest with me, don't just tell me.

465
00:59:01,558 --> 00:59:04,658
I have gotten better because you want to root for me or whatever.

466
00:59:04,658 --> 00:59:06,358
Like, what have you what are you saying?

467
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:08,158
Have I gotten better at this or not?

468
00:59:08,258 --> 00:59:12,258
And do you have any feedback or advice for me as to how I can improve?

469
00:59:12,558 --> 00:59:15,958
So, we build this into our product, that's part of the coaching is, right?

470
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:27,158
We do that Baseline Where We Gather that data, and then we will come back and Survey the team and provide data that shows that people are actually improving in these skills, but you can do that again.

471
00:59:27,158 --> 00:59:33,858
Like, if you're, if you're really invested in, This and you have got, you know, you feel good about this skills catalog and you're getting feedback from your team.

472
00:59:34,158 --> 00:59:53,258
The worst thing you can do is get all that feedback and then never come back to them and share anything about like you know, they were vulnerable with you and they told you what they thought you could be better at and like, man, that would be such a shame did not come back to them and say, hey, I worked on this and I would love your input as to like whether or not you think I have gotten better.

473
00:59:53,658 --> 00:59:56,158
And I am going to keep working on these areas.

474
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:58,758
So what do you think I can do about the next?

475
00:59:58,858 --> 01:00:01,058
Just four weeks to get better at this.

476
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:02,258
That's huge.

477
01:00:06,758 --> 01:00:06,958
It's great.

478
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:14,758
I am going to open with a question on just I know we're talking about managers a lot, and she would have coaching that supports managers.

479
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:20,458
How does a manager be a good coach for their teams as well?

480
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:30,958
Like so managers that are not you know, coaches professionally, but we know that the best way to you get results for your team is to coach them as well.

481
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:34,558
What are some of those things that managers can take home with you?

482
01:00:34,558 --> 01:00:38,758
Teams to say, no, I am gonna have a team of five people.

483
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:42,858
What are some of those best practices that I can take to my team?

484
01:00:43,058 --> 01:00:45,258
My starting tomorrow right?

485
01:00:45,658 --> 01:00:46,758
From a coaching perspective?

486
01:00:47,258 --> 01:00:47,558
Yeah.

487
01:00:47,558 --> 01:00:51,158
So I have got a I mean at the end of the day it comes down to asking questions.

488
01:00:51,258 --> 01:00:57,558
I have a five-year-old and I think she's a really good model for what this looks like, we're right Gina.

489
01:00:57,558 --> 01:01:02,958
I saw your kid popped in the other day when we were doing the prep, they asked why they ask why all the time, right?

490
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:04,158
There's why is it that?

491
01:01:04,158 --> 01:01:04,958
And then, Why?

492
01:01:05,258 --> 01:01:07,258
So, the five wise is a great model.

493
01:01:07,758 --> 01:01:11,558
But something happens where we lose that from kids, when becoming adults.

494
01:01:11,558 --> 01:01:13,458
And it feels like conflicting.

495
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:17,558
So, I think, again, as a coach, if your job are, sorry, is a manager.

496
01:01:17,558 --> 01:01:25,058
If your job is to coach your team, one of the biggest things tactically, I would say is have your team.

497
01:01:25,058 --> 01:01:29,058
So I have all my direct reports and me kind of like an update each week.

498
01:01:29,058 --> 01:01:30,158
Here's what I worked on this week.

499
01:01:30,158 --> 01:01:33,658
Here's what I am working on next week, and here's the support I need from you.

500
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:38,458
And what That does are when we have our weekly one-on-ones.

501
01:01:38,758 --> 01:01:45,158
I don't have to spend any time getting status updates from you, I can just dive into figuring out what do you need?

502
01:01:46,058 --> 01:01:47,258
So I think that's a tactical thing.

503
01:01:47,258 --> 01:02:01,658
You got to do like you got to take the Tactical status update things, which you need is a manager to do your job out of the synchronous kind of one-on-one time that you have with your direct report and Reserve that time for asking questions.

504
01:02:01,658 --> 01:02:04,358
So you know, I noticed that you're working on this.

505
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:04,758
Thing.

506
01:02:04,758 --> 01:02:06,058
But you're running into this challenge.

507
01:02:06,058 --> 01:02:09,558
Why do you think that's happening and the might give an answer right?

508
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:13,858
Oh well so-and-so just you know, isn't prioritizing this for me.

509
01:02:13,858 --> 01:02:15,158
Well, why do you think that is?

510
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:16,258
Right?

511
01:02:16,258 --> 01:02:20,658
Well I think he's, you know, prioritizing this other thing because he thinks that's more important.

512
01:02:20,658 --> 01:02:23,658
The business like well why do you think that he thinks that's more important than this is?

513
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:25,458
Like, it feels weird, feels unnatural.

514
01:02:25,758 --> 01:02:28,258
But you get to the root of like this is what's going on?

515
01:02:28,258 --> 01:02:30,758
Actually, maybe I failed to articulate.

516
01:02:30,758 --> 01:02:34,458
Why what I need is more important than what he is working.

517
01:02:34,558 --> 01:02:36,658
Hang on to him and him being successful.

518
01:02:36,658 --> 01:02:38,358
Like I never thought about it that way.

519
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:42,458
I am going to change the way I make the ask so that he understands that.

520
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,458
This isn't just a thing I need for my team.

521
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:48,658
Like, this is something he needs and the organization needs to be really successful.

522
01:02:48,858 --> 01:02:50,158
Let me reframe it, that way.

523
01:02:50,758 --> 01:02:52,158
That's your job as a manager.

524
01:02:52,858 --> 01:02:59,358
The other thing I would do and again this comes from this book as well is so you should meet with your direct reports once a week.

525
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:12,958
I think, for sure at least a half hour every week, but what she does is once a month, the one-on-ones are about your career, they're not about the kind of tactical things that you're working on right now.

526
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:20,858
At this company it's more figuring out where do you want to be going with your career and Reid Hoffman?

527
01:03:20,858 --> 01:03:25,058
The founder of LinkedIn has this great framework which is called a row Alliance.

528
01:03:25,058 --> 01:03:26,358
He wrote a book about it.

529
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:35,458
I don't know if y'all heard about this but this idea of like you know we don't live in a world anymore where somebody works at a company for 40 years, and they get the role Watch, by the way.

530
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:36,458
This is not a Rolex.

531
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:43,958
Well, I am sorry, you know, like that's an outdated model people tend to work from, you know, three to five years, and they can they move.

532
01:03:45,058 --> 01:03:51,158
And, so I think acknowledging that as a leader that like, this is an alliance, it's not a power Dynamic.

533
01:03:51,158 --> 01:03:54,758
We're like you work for this company and you need to do what this company needs.

534
01:03:54,758 --> 01:04:03,658
It's like no, we need to also give you the skills and the critical experiences you want to gain to kind of get you to that next level in your career.

535
01:04:03,758 --> 01:04:06,558
So, let us Check, let us document what that looks like.

536
01:04:06,658 --> 01:04:09,258
And then once a month, let us revisit that document.

537
01:04:09,258 --> 01:04:14,258
Like, what are, you know, what zoom out like, hey, you're trying to become a chief marketing officer.

538
01:04:14,258 --> 01:04:17,158
Like, here's some of the things you were hoping to get done this year.

539
01:04:18,158 --> 01:04:25,258
Does that align with the types of stuff that we're working on right now, like why or why not do we want to shift things around like does that make sense for the business to do that?

540
01:04:25,258 --> 01:04:31,558
So I think those types of conversations are really important to avoiding the staff that you mentioned Gina at the beginning of the call.

541
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:49,858
Because when you look at that, voluntary turnover I was Looking at this stat over half of the exiting employees who left a company, say that in the three months before they left, neither their manager, nor any other leaders spoke to them about their job satisfaction or their future with the organization.

542
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:58,558
So, you have got to do that, like, you have got to acknowledge, it's a two-way street, it is not just this person's job to do the job description, you have laid out.

543
01:04:58,558 --> 01:05:03,858
It's your job to set them up for a really successful career in the time that there with you.

544
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:05,958
So good.

545
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:08,658
So we need to check out those two books that you recommended.

546
01:05:08,658 --> 01:05:14,658
You said it was making of the manager by Julie and then there's a Reid, Hoffman one as well.

547
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:21,658
You know, I think mentions it's like Tour of Duty or something the alliance by Reid Hoffman, the alliance.

548
01:05:21,758 --> 01:05:22,458
Okay.

549
01:05:22,658 --> 01:05:23,358
Awesome.

550
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:25,058
Well we got some questions coming in.

551
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:30,758
So let us tackle this first one here or second question for today.

552
01:05:30,758 --> 01:05:33,958
How do you get someone resistant?

553
01:05:35,258 --> 01:05:37,458
20, I just lost it.

554
01:05:37,758 --> 01:05:38,158
Here it is.

555
01:05:39,158 --> 01:05:43,558
How do you get someone resistant to coaching self-aware enough to get the help?

556
01:05:43,558 --> 01:05:44,358
They need.

557
01:05:44,758 --> 01:05:45,358
Mmm.

558
01:05:46,258 --> 01:05:47,158
Such a good one.

559
01:05:50,258 --> 01:05:55,858
I mean, I would love to tell you that 100% of the time.

560
01:05:55,858 --> 01:05:56,758
You can do that.

561
01:05:56,758 --> 01:06:06,758
You can get someone to buy in and say like okay I get it I got to be vulnerable, I got to acknowledge what my blind spots are and what my gaps are.

562
01:06:09,258 --> 01:06:14,358
I was talking to a coach, but the fact the matter is, you can't, everybody is going to get there.

563
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:35,358
And I was talking to a coach about this and saying, kind of like, what is, what is the landscape of people who are Capable of actually, like getting there and doing this, and he said, there's a small minority of people who are literally for psychological reasons, like, incapable of doing this.

564
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:38,358
Maybe it's because of how they are raised, or how their brain is wired.

565
01:06:38,858 --> 01:06:39,958
They just can't do it.

566
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:41,758
They're not willing to be vulnerable.

567
01:06:41,758 --> 01:06:44,558
And so with those folks you have got to figure out.

568
01:06:44,658 --> 01:06:45,558
Do you have one of those?

569
01:06:45,558 --> 01:06:46,158
The odds are.

570
01:06:46,158 --> 01:06:47,558
You don't like the?

571
01:06:47,558 --> 01:06:49,158
He said the vast majority of us are.

572
01:06:49,158 --> 01:06:52,058
Just are his words Garden variety neurotics.

573
01:06:52,558 --> 01:07:03,858
And so with those you can through coaching and through feedback, you can get them there and it's got to be in a way that's, you know, as objective as possible and is clear and specific as possible.

574
01:07:04,058 --> 01:07:09,058
But there are going to be people who just resist and are not able to get there.

575
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:17,158
And in those situations like it's a way more difficult conversation is like is this person going to be successful in this company or in this team?

576
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:20,358
But I would tell you like small minority.

577
01:07:20,358 --> 01:07:23,558
The vast majority are just Like the rest of us Garden.

578
01:07:23,558 --> 01:07:24,558
Variety neurotics.

579
01:07:25,658 --> 01:07:30,658
Yeah, one what one thing I would add to that Tyler and I think going back to like personal professional.

580
01:07:30,758 --> 01:07:47,158
I think if folks are tied to Performance being all personal versus this is a job that I have to get done and the job requires a b c, and d and self-awareness, would say that there is a gap between me understanding how to perform those ABC.

581
01:07:47,158 --> 01:07:49,858
And he's, then I need some support.

582
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:51,458
I need a strategic partner.

583
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:52,558
I need a plan in place.

584
01:07:52,558 --> 01:07:55,258
I need the Milestones to hit the books.

585
01:07:55,458 --> 01:08:03,058
Read the coaching, the program, whatever it is, so that I can grow and hit the mark, on those things that are required.

586
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:06,858
You know, for me, I resisted coaching for a long time.

587
01:08:06,858 --> 01:08:09,358
I have a coach right now, but my wife is a coach.

588
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:21,758
And so, I have always I have at home, we know the power of coaching, but there was a part of me for some time that said, I don't know, I don't want to sit down with someone to sort of like I am leaving to go figure it out.

589
01:08:21,858 --> 01:08:23,758
I am gonna figure it out my own XYZ.

590
01:08:24,258 --> 01:08:35,558
But when you Understand that the job your growth and your growth trajectory is going to require you to learn and adapt at a much faster rate likely than you have before.

591
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:40,957
When you separate that personal Thing versus the job to be done.

592
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:46,058
And when there's a separation there and you look at it tactically and say I have to go do this new job.

593
01:08:46,058 --> 01:08:48,158
Therefore, I need a new manual.

594
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:49,658
Therefore, I need a new skill.

595
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,358
Therefore, I need to sharpen.

596
01:08:51,358 --> 01:08:55,258
This other thing that I haven't done before or I haven't done it in a long time.

597
01:08:55,658 --> 01:09:03,258
It makes it easier to engage in the support and strategic partnership that a coach can bring where I or peer can have.

598
01:09:03,358 --> 01:09:14,258
But if it's, if the person is not able to get to a point of self-awareness, and say, this is the thing that I have to go do, there's a gap here, and I need support, and it's a really, really hard thing to get done.

599
01:09:14,957 --> 01:09:16,058
Yeah, yeah.

600
01:09:16,058 --> 01:09:27,358
I think demystifying, what coaching is, and what I often say is, what we do is we help people have uncomfortable conversations Say that to anybody any Walk of Life.

601
01:09:27,358 --> 01:09:29,658
Any industry, any level of leadership?

602
01:09:29,658 --> 01:09:30,258
They all go.

603
01:09:30,658 --> 01:09:31,558
I need that.

604
01:09:31,658 --> 01:09:33,258
I could use some help with that.

605
01:09:33,258 --> 01:09:35,158
Like of course you can we all deal with it all the time.

606
01:09:35,158 --> 01:09:36,957
They're like, I could use that my personal life too.

607
01:09:37,258 --> 01:09:41,058
So I think when you kind of just get to a something concrete, it's not this.

608
01:09:41,058 --> 01:09:43,457
Woo self Explorer ation.

609
01:09:43,457 --> 01:09:44,758
I mean, there is going to be some of that.

610
01:09:44,758 --> 01:09:52,358
But like, when you get to the problem that's sitting in front of me today, which is like you have to have uncomfortable conversations, would you like some help with that?

611
01:09:52,457 --> 01:09:53,358
I think a lot of people go.

612
01:09:53,358 --> 01:10:01,258
Oh yeah, because if I could do that better, After we can, we could grow so much faster, we could spend so much less money on an attrition all this stuff.

613
01:10:01,658 --> 01:10:12,158
Then it comes solidifies for people like okay, even though that's not an accurate reflection of the totality of what coaching is, I think that's made out of a taste for that, but I think that's a really important.

614
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:18,958
Tyler is like getting as tactful as possible because then that makes it like, oh, okay, these are five things.

615
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:22,158
I have to go work on because I know that there's a gap there right now.

616
01:10:22,258 --> 01:10:25,258
Okay, so how do I drive a better performance for my team?

617
01:10:25,558 --> 01:10:27,158
Right now, we have been performing here.

618
01:10:27,358 --> 01:10:28,658
I need to get them to hear.

619
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:29,658
How do I do that?

620
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:32,958
Well, I am having tough conversations, how do I do that better?

621
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:37,158
Or I am feeling burnt out as a manager because I am feeling all this pressure.

622
01:10:37,558 --> 01:10:39,158
How do I fix that right?

623
01:10:39,258 --> 01:10:46,358
I am versus making it these ambiguities ambiguous sort of like conversation with someone else.

624
01:10:46,558 --> 01:10:47,958
Yeah, yeah.

625
01:10:48,058 --> 01:10:49,358
That's the Doom Loop.

626
01:10:50,658 --> 01:10:51,958
Thanks so much negativity.

627
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:58,658
Without that Clarity and without that structure You know I think it you get into those cyclical do lips.

628
01:10:59,258 --> 01:11:02,158
So all right we got two other questions.

629
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,158
Pull up this next question.

630
01:11:06,358 --> 01:11:12,458
Can you share with us, a personal experience where you struggle between choosing compassion versus empathy?

631
01:11:12,758 --> 01:11:14,258
Which one did you end up choosing?

632
01:11:14,258 --> 01:11:20,158
And why I got one.

633
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:30,058
This is a friend of mine who She processes stress (differently) than I do.

634
01:11:30,758 --> 01:11:33,758
And so it took me a long time to realize she doesn't need compassion.

635
01:11:33,758 --> 01:11:34,658
She needs empathy.

636
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:39,158
When I process the way I process stress is, I am I go boxing.

637
01:11:39,258 --> 01:11:42,058
I go play tennis like I don't need to talk about the thing.

638
01:11:42,058 --> 01:11:43,658
That's stressing me out that actually makes it worse.

639
01:11:43,658 --> 01:11:45,858
It stresses me, more talking about it.

640
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:48,558
So I meditate like, it's not like a bottle it up.

641
01:11:48,558 --> 01:11:53,258
Like I just I process internally but what helps me is more compassion.

642
01:11:53,258 --> 01:11:54,558
Like, hey, help me solve my pride.

643
01:11:54,558 --> 01:11:58,158
If I am coming to you with something like Because I want you to solve my problem.

644
01:11:58,758 --> 01:12:20,258
So I think personally the relationship with this person improves significantly, when I realized all I have to do is just listen to her talk and think about how hard this is for her and articulate that and like you know try to build her confidence up but not solve the problem and that was like Game Changer like for that relationship.

645
01:12:20,258 --> 01:12:21,558
So that's one.

646
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:40,758
Yeah, I have 128 you know, for me, I am always trying to be Mr. Fixit, I am attack in the motor, like this is like, like somebody that I really care about where I work with them or someone and my family, or friend, they're having an issue.

647
01:12:40,758 --> 01:12:42,858
I am like, I am going to fix the thing that's causing you.

648
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:59,958
An issue that will fix the situation, or, you know what, like, I have to be strong it in a personal situation, when families going through grief for The grief and you like, you know what, almost, I am not gonna show my sentimental side.

649
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:07,858
I am not going to show my emotions because I need to be strong for that person that I care about the reality.

650
01:13:08,058 --> 01:13:16,558
They want you to sit with them in De grief, they want you to sit with them in the sorrow and just be there.

651
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:31,858
And listen, and be vulnerable with the person getting under the rock, getting under the boater with the person and just sitting there and say, look, okay, let us just be in this together versus just attacking the boat of the entire time.

652
01:13:31,858 --> 01:13:45,058
There's been countless times, I think in my personal life, that's been a learning lesson for me, because I have always been Mr. Fixit, you don't have to go fix the problem versus just sitting with the person going through the problem.

653
01:13:45,258 --> 01:13:46,058
Not feel you, man.

654
01:13:46,058 --> 01:13:47,158
You and I are very similar.

655
01:13:47,258 --> 01:13:54,658
Next, that's a game changer, and I am probably like, your friend Tyler, where I am like, Hey, I am Sport Boulder.

656
01:13:54,758 --> 01:13:57,358
Can you just be here next to me and cry with me?

657
01:13:58,858 --> 01:14:05,858
And I actually talked about Coach helped me realize like that doesn't, you're not solving the problem like you're a problem.

658
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,658
Solver your Mr. Fixit, it's not working.

659
01:14:07,658 --> 01:14:10,558
So like when you get under the boulder, it actually solves the problem.

660
01:14:10,558 --> 01:14:12,058
So it's scratches your itch, too.

661
01:14:13,258 --> 01:14:14,358
That's really good.

662
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:22,158
