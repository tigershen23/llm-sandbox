00:20:56,385 --> 00:21:02,985
So even right here where represented all over the world where are you Abhishek and Roberto?

46
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:13,385
I will kick off, I mostly on the Eastern time zone right now, I am in Puerto Rico but you know in a couple weeks I am going to be in Philadelphia.

47
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:24,485
And so this is a beauty about remote, work could be wherever in the world Yeah, I am in Bangalore in India, but I am working on PT time zone.

48
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:28,085
So welcome everyone and great to meet with you.

49
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:30,885
Awesome.

50
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:32,485
That's cool.

51
00:21:32,485 --> 00:21:37,785
It's truly distributed represented here and even in our audience, which is amazing.

52
00:21:37,785 --> 00:21:39,685
And that's why engagement is.

53
00:21:39,685 --> 00:21:45,985
So, top of mind, takes a lot of intentionality, and I am excited to be able to dive into that a little bit more with each of you.

54
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:49,385
Can you tell me a little bit more about your company's?

55
00:21:49,385 --> 00:21:56,685
And how you all are solving for the Transformer, formative work place today with distributed teams.

56
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,985
If you said you weren't, you want to take that one first and then I will jump in.

57
00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:11,385
Oh, so you know very quickly about good ERA in very simple, terms could areas like an know what?

58
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:20,785
We call an Airbnb of volunteering, where we work with nonprofits, thousands of nonprofits across, more than 100 countries globally.

59
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:29,085
Understand their volunteering in requirements on board them on good errors platform and offer it to employees of our customers.

60
00:22:29,385 --> 00:22:36,285
So that Employee across any part of the world can volunteer in a very, very simple Manner.

61
00:22:36,785 --> 00:22:44,085
And the reason why we started that was, you know, it's just so strange that in this world volunteering is just so difficult.

62
00:22:44,585 --> 00:22:51,485
You know, it's so easy to get a pizza delivered home or get a cab but it's just so difficult to volunteer and that's what we wanted to Saul.

63
00:22:51,485 --> 00:23:00,085
And, you know, currently work with the hundreds of companies with 16 Fortune, 500 with 7 million employees volunteering with us across.

64
00:23:00,185 --> 00:23:02,785
Asset globe and, you know, great too great to be here.

65
00:23:03,985 --> 00:23:11,285
And you know, as soon as I heard about the topic and I know this was been in the works for a little while.

66
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:32,885
I was just intrigued because I think that volunteering and I know I am talk about welcome here in a second, but I think volunteering is so important in connecting people together where I like when you can work side by side with someone for a good cause Beyond like your day-to-day job, it does something pretty special and income and uniting employees for a bigger.

67
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:35,885
Cause I have been Pretty Hands-On with volunteering.

68
00:23:35,985 --> 00:23:41,585
Like, in the real world virtually though, I haven't really experienced much of it.

69
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:45,585
And, so I am looking forward to learning what this is all about, as well.

70
00:23:46,985 --> 00:23:48,885
So guys, my name is Roberto Ortiz.

71
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,985
I am co-founder and CEO of welcome.

72
00:23:51,185 --> 00:23:52,985
Welcome is the platform that we're hosting.

73
00:23:52,985 --> 00:23:54,085
This experience on.

74
00:23:54,685 --> 00:24:00,485
What we do is we help companies that have distributed teams bringing them together in more intentional ways.

75
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:10,585
And so employee experiences actually draw Drive a lot of connection belonging amounts of months of work force and our technology makes it.

76
00:24:10,585 --> 00:24:13,985
So it's much easier and engaging for everybody that's participating.

77
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:22,985
And so we're serving customers from the startup that has a remote team to accompany a five, ten thousand people that have employees around the world.

78
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:23,885
And so that's what we did.

79
00:24:23,985 --> 00:24:24,885
And I am glad to be here.

80
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:25,485
Thanks for being here.

81
00:24:26,585 --> 00:24:27,185
Awesome.

82
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:27,685
Thank you.

83
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:29,585
Both for those intros.

84
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,885
You know, I would love to kick it off, actually, with this survey.

85
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:38,085
That Abhishek your team had conducted with your own customers.

86
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:47,085
And so if we could pull that on stage, it actually gives some really good insights into why orgs are opting into virtual volunteering.

87
00:24:47,085 --> 00:25:03,885
So as we're seeing here, 33% care about Community impact, aligned in our cause areas, 33% care about Employee Engagement, 25% employee well-being, and mental health, and 9% care about the employee Learning and Development.

88
00:25:03,985 --> 00:25:08,585
Mint Abhishek, could you elaborate on this a little bit more for us?

89
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:10,285
Yeah, absolutely.

90
00:25:10,285 --> 00:25:27,485
And you know us, as we all know, the pandemic has, you know, had a huge impact on everyone of us across the world and the need to do good or you know, help or contribute to the world is higher than ever before.

91
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:35,085
So everyone feels that urge and need to do good, but because of constraints in a bit What's the pandemic?

92
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:46,785
It's extremely difficult to go out there and help and contribute but you know, how do you then convert this intention and the need to do good and it's just not, you know, from a healthcare and education perspective.

93
00:25:46,785 --> 00:26:23,385
But you know, things like Racial equality and climate change and now her whole bunch of issues, especially the younger folks are extremely motivated to do something, and there needs to be a channelization of these energies and this need and Motivation in a positive manner and that's where virtual volunteering comes in is how can companies effectively channelize, the need, an urge to contribute in a much more engaging and effective manner than that's even the alignment with social causes and, you know, it's just not a greenwashing kind of thing, but it's actually very, very meaningful.

94
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:33,885
It's not top down, but a very inclusive, very Democratic way in, which employees can come together to do good, another same time, it's probably the most meaningful Employee Engagement.

95
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:47,585
You know, in today's world where we talk about, you know, the great resignation or the great reshuffle and every companies trying to do something around engagement which is very you know check the box kind of thing with just seems.

96
00:26:47,585 --> 00:26:50,085
Okay, why am I doing it versus doing something?

97
00:26:50,085 --> 00:27:03,785
Which is actually meaningful something, which is helping someone in need something, where you use your time and skills, effectively is just so much more satisfying for you individually, and that's where the meaningful employing.

98
00:27:03,985 --> 00:27:07,985
A judgment comes in and the last piece is around this mental health and well-being.

99
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:17,785
And you know, we all know that when you volunteer there is something called as oxy toxin that's a hormone which gets released which, you know, makes you feel happier.

100
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:24,085
And, you know, everyone wants a lot more happiness today and this is just a beautiful way of doing it.

101
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:30,685
Where you know, it's your helping someone and feeling happy and as you do something for someone you also learn by using your skills.

102
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:33,885
You know you might be an intern somewhere but you are helping.

103
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,785
Nonprofit are really, really big way and that's the Learning and Development.

104
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:40,685
So these are just some of the different ways in which, you know, volunteering is.

105
00:27:40,685 --> 00:27:48,685
So, so very powerful, and we have customers seeing the direct benefit of it as their employees volunteer across the world.

106
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:52,785
Mmm, that's really.

107
00:27:52,785 --> 00:28:05,685
It's actually, I think, I think I just go back to, you know, when you were just, again, my experience in volunteering typically when you're volunteering, you think that?

108
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:15,085
Hey, I am gonna go help a group of people or, you know, I am going to partner with my friends, are going to go volunteer all day or take a trip and help clean this up or go.

109
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:28,485
He will be Hands-On and the school and go ready to And you do that with all the right intentions and typically people go to do it because they want to help people in many ways.

110
00:28:28,485 --> 00:28:41,585
Just like you're saying you walk away from that being helped so much more profoundly yourself and your team walks away with the better scent of accomplishment, not just because they help somebody.

111
00:28:41,585 --> 00:28:50,585
But this something within them I remember going to one trip I thought that hey we could just we have to go help me schools we have to help put the plumbing inside these Schools that don't have Plumbing.

112
00:28:50,585 --> 00:28:55,585
We have to go figure this out and I went for like two weeks, and we're working in the Sun and doing all of this work.

113
00:28:57,085 --> 00:29:00,285
But it was the most rewarding thing for me like fine back home.

114
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:13,185
It wasn't that I was hoping people but it was the appreciation for the people that are on the ground that people that do this every single day, the people that are inside of these, you know, like these volunteering.

115
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:17,485
Hubs that are dedicated the entire lives to go make a difference, right?

116
00:29:17,485 --> 00:29:21,885
And then you get to an Of that purpose that they do every single day.

117
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:27,785
And that just, you just walk away just more much more impacted, than anything else and so, I just, I don't know.

118
00:29:27,785 --> 00:29:30,285
I am just a big fan of doing things like this.

119
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:37,585
I think, remote, we may be good to kind of talk about, like, what are the opportunities in doing this remotely?

120
00:29:37,885 --> 00:29:40,185
And what are the challenges in doing a remotely?

121
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:44,385
Like, I am curious to say like what are like, at a high level?

122
00:29:44,385 --> 00:29:49,285
I think that, you know, some volunteering things, you can't do, because you can't go pick up.

123
00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:51,485
Paint brush and go pink or school.

124
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:51,985
Right.

125
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:57,285
There is probably a ton that you could do that.

126
00:29:57,285 --> 00:30:03,685
Even like if you think about like us as many ways like knowledge workers, there's a lot of things that we could do that.

127
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:10,785
Maybe what you and your company do is unlock that and really start to catalyze.

128
00:30:10,785 --> 00:30:19,385
Those kind of things, I would be curious to learn like from your perspective, what are you seeing being some of the common things that companies are doing remotely?

129
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:22,485
Virtually that you really can't do, right?

130
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:23,685
If it's in the physical world.

131
00:30:24,585 --> 00:30:25,285
So absolutely.

132
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:37,485
And I think the first thing is I we have seen teams being distributed across time zones locations languages and how do you bring a team together and do something, which is Meaningful?

133
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:49,285
One of our most popular volunteering activities, is recording, audio books for blind, kids, you know, we're a team comes together on a virtual call.

134
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:59,585
There is a good are a host, you know, someone like Carla would be hosting you today where they do some fun icebreakers to an orientation about the nonprofit.

135
00:30:59,785 --> 00:31:12,185
And then there are individual audio books, which are given to employees that they can record, and these audio books, once recorded and Q Cedar given to a local nonprofit, which works a blind kids, and these nonprofits is spread across the world with good error.

136
00:31:12,185 --> 00:31:22,085
So if you're a team in the US and the East Coast, a non-profit in New York or in California or in Dubai, or Singapore or Bangalore, They are local nonprofits who benefit from it.

137
00:31:22,685 --> 00:31:23,985
It's a very simple activity.

138
00:31:23,985 --> 00:31:26,585
Takes just, you know, one hour to do it.

139
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:27,885
It's very fulfilling.

140
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:31,885
It's also something where you don't require a lot of preparation.

141
00:31:31,885 --> 00:31:36,485
It's really, really fun, very engaging and you feel really, really happy after it.

142
00:31:36,485 --> 00:31:58,785
So it's something you know really wonderful and there are volunteering activities across different cause areas of its stem education, climate change, you know, Pride accessibility dni, and we work with a lot of these what we call employee resource groups, or ERG is our communities within companies to help them further their cause that they care about.

143
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:04,685
So, so that's just one example of activities in other ones are reviewing resumes for you.

144
00:32:04,985 --> 00:32:16,185
In a lot of you don't have access to high-quality resumes, you could review those resumes, make it high quality, and they might get a job, which is just, you know, they would never get access to Talent like this.

145
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:19,385
So we work with an apple or an Amazon or an Airbnb.

146
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:23,985
And, you know, I would have loved to have someone at Apple review my résumé.

147
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:28,785
You know, when I was a kid and that's something, you know, only possible through volunteering.

148
00:32:28,785 --> 00:32:35,985
So, it's really amazing, the kind of value that you could add remotely in just an hour together as a team and also have fun together.

149
00:32:36,985 --> 00:32:40,185
I mean, just by you even talk about this, it makes me feel good.

150
00:32:40,185 --> 00:32:40,685
How many?

151
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:44,085
I mean can we do some hands in chat and you feel you feeling good?

152
00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:49,385
Now, do you realize you're volunteering yet and the thought in the thinking about tearing makes you just feel?

153
00:32:49,485 --> 00:32:50,385
I feel so much better.

154
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:55,785
I, first of all we have to figure out how to do one of these things internally here at welcome.

155
00:32:55,785 --> 00:33:09,385
So in the Green Room which apart talk about like getting hooked up at figuring this out but at a high level I just, I don't know, I just, I just feel pretty bought into this whole opportunity of volunteering remotely.

156
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:11,985
So and we do now set up because I will get us off.

157
00:33:11,985 --> 00:33:13,685
Try, these are good questions.

158
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:14,385
Yeah, I know.

159
00:33:14,385 --> 00:33:14,985
Thank you.

160
00:33:15,085 --> 00:33:17,485
Thank you both for leaning into it.

161
00:33:18,185 --> 00:33:26,785
So, I kind of dig more into the challenges because engaging employees is hard remote.

162
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:29,385
Everything feels a little bit extra.

163
00:33:29,385 --> 00:33:41,985
You know, we don't have those water cooler moments where we just run into the office, and we can have, you know, a quick little chat, connect even solve problems in those asynchronous informal manners, right?

164
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:48,885
We don't have that and I think about volunteering Robbie were touching this bit being there in person.

165
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:57,985
And, like, Really solving for whether it's like building the house for somebody or feeding somebody like you don't really have that virtually.

166
00:33:57,985 --> 00:34:02,785
So I do see how the things that you're calling out.

167
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:09,585
Can help bring that oxytocin but I have since you know there's a little further intentionality that's needed.

168
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:13,585
How do you guys solve for that in this evolving?

169
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,585
Virtual District distributed world that we're in right now?

170
00:34:18,185 --> 00:34:19,784
You know, you constantly have to innovate Constant.

171
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:20,784
Had to be creative.

172
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:26,685
How you guys solving for both of you solving for this, for your customers, and for your own employees?

173
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:36,284
So I will jump in and give it back just a broader one and then I mean Abhishek and you can bring it home with like you know the work that you're doing I think high level.

174
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:48,685
So for us and I will just speak about because a lot of people here that are working remotely or hybrid type of setup or are trying to figure out and pull engagement at their companies as well as.

175
00:34:48,685 --> 00:35:01,885
So for us at welcome we're we were born a remote, we're staying remote, that's what we do, and then we huddle people upright regionally or yearly For in-person activities, just from a cultural perspective.

176
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:20,085
I think something to just acknowledge is that throughout the last two years we were all forced to go remote and being forced to go remote, meaning means that you necessarily then, I mean you didn't opt into it, you're just figuring it out as you go, and we're all honest, we have been trying to figure it out as we go.

177
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:30,885
But I think the companies that buy into being remote first or 100% remote or Embracing remote and distributed teams.

178
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:48,285
I think it starts at the onboarding of bringing employee in and saying like your part of remote culture, that means that the way we operate the way we function is X y&z the way that we connect is a b and c versus this sort of hodgepodge that we have been in.

179
00:35:48,285 --> 00:35:54,285
We have been forced to figure it out and have a lot of questions and I think, honestly, like organizations.

180
00:35:54,285 --> 00:36:02,685
Haven't really figured it out because they have been sort of stuck in the Person only being forced to go remote hoping that we can come back to in person.

181
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:17,685
And what we're finding is that there's tension and pool where employees don't want that and people want flexibility, but the processes and practices have not been matured in a lot of organizations especially organizations that didn't start with remote first.

182
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:20,985
And, so I think organizations that have already been functioning remote.

183
00:36:20,985 --> 00:36:26,585
We have figured out how to have an amazing culture and how to drive connection among their employees.

184
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:51,985
So it's not that it's not possible, but it's actually something you have to be very intentional about Can and just to add to that, you know what you have seen amongst, the team is, sometimes the remote is tends to become very transactional that okay, this is a meeting, this is a call, this is the agenda, and we don't know each other as humans or you know, who are we as people?

185
00:36:52,785 --> 00:37:14,585
And you need a platform where you could be in a vulnerable where you could be sensitive, very could share stories Beyond work and that's where you know, to an extent volunteering comes in where You know when you see nonprofits when you see, you know folks on the ground having so much more problems and yourself, you tend to become a lot more emotional.

186
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:34,885
You tend to become a lot more sensitive, you become more resilient and you start sharing a lot more and you feel safe sharing in the in that you know group or in that time and that builds connection and that bills, you know, empathy and that bills, you know like a family feeling where you feel safe to share things with each other and that Pins.

187
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,985
Only because that's atmosphere gets created during a voluntary experience.

188
00:37:39,185 --> 00:37:45,985
Very learn about the nonprofit about the cause about things which people go through about in all the good and bad things happening.

189
00:37:45,985 --> 00:37:46,985
I was in the world.

190
00:37:47,085 --> 00:37:55,985
And when you as a group and as a team come together and go through that, emotional experience, share stories in a work together, create something, which is Meaningful.

191
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:59,985
You feel a lot more connected and that builds human connection.

192
00:37:59,985 --> 00:38:02,585
And we were on a volunteering call.

193
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:19,485
Where there was a CEO there was An intern and there was a fire old kid and the kid didn't know that this who is the CEO and who's the intern and, you know, just talking as normal people and that created such a great bond between the CEO and the intern, which was never possible earlier.

194
00:38:19,485 --> 00:38:26,485
So I think it brings every human to the human angle rather than designations and titles and roles.

195
00:38:26,785 --> 00:38:44,485
And that makes it a really beautiful experience and that creates something which, you know, we sometimes gray for in the virtual world and That's what we try and do is also build connections, you know, create empathy, and emotions in a very structured environment through the volunteer experience across the year.

196
00:38:44,485 --> 00:38:48,485
And it's just not about doing it once a year during givingtuesday Thanksgiving.

197
00:38:48,485 --> 00:38:53,785
But doing it frequently, you want to build connection and everyone is passionate about different things.

198
00:38:53,785 --> 00:39:00,085
You know, someone likes to work for pet, animals for climate change to stem education for women and girls and across the year.

199
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:03,885
There are moments where you could do it and it creates, you know, communities.

200
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:10,785
Within the company that become really strong and connected and that's what you have seen happen at good area as well.

201
00:39:12,585 --> 00:39:13,485
That's awesome.

202
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:24,585
I totally agree on that human to human connection and being able to be intentional to enable those very human real authentic, moments virtually with your remote teams.

203
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:27,685
I think that is the challenge of what we're figuring out.

204
00:39:27,685 --> 00:39:31,085
But these are some great ideas and insights.

205
00:39:31,685 --> 00:39:36,085
We have got about a few minutes left before we jump into our volunteering activity.

206
00:39:36,085 --> 00:39:37,485
So I didn't want to open up.

207
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:42,185
If there're any questions that you all have for our panelists, feel free to drop them.

208
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:43,485
The Q&A tab.

209
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:46,585
In the meantime, I have got here.

210
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:53,385
One last question, about mental health and well-being, this is top of Mind top priority.

211
00:39:54,285 --> 00:39:55,185
You know, Roberto.

212
00:39:55,185 --> 00:40:08,585
You recently just signed a pledge with Thrive about mental health, and wellness, and the accountability that you along with 80 other companies and gadara, hope you all sign that pledge as well.

213
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:15,285
You know, a lot of folks are beginning to see the value of this, for their organizations?

214
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:21,185
How are you all thinking about mental health and wellbeing for your employees?

215
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:27,985
And are you seeing any great best practices across your customers?

216
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,985
You know, would love any inputs here.

217
00:40:33,285 --> 00:40:35,385
Yeah thanks for teeing that up Tina.

218
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:57,785
Yeah we signed a pledge and a partnership with Thrive and a bunch of other organizations as well and I think just kind of like put a like just whole space for that I think it's we're all in this like continue a journey of how to want support our employees support our customers and also as Leaders figure it out ourselves right?

219
00:40:57,785 --> 00:41:01,685
I think well-being and preventing burnout starts at the top.

220
00:41:01,885 --> 00:41:10,285
And so, we're burnt out as leaders, and we're not showing it and exhibiting it, and taking days off and, and practicing the things that we need to practice being.

221
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:14,785
Well, there's going to be hard for us to try to support our employees and doing the same.

222
00:41:14,885 --> 00:41:31,685
And so for me, I say that, like, for me to hear myself speak that because I need to do that more often myself, in terms of the Pledge, you know, we're just committed to just, you know, mental health is a core, a core requirement for all of us to show up.

223
00:41:31,885 --> 00:41:33,285
Up while and do our jobs.

224
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:36,285
Well, if our employees are well then they're going to do their best work.

225
00:41:36,985 --> 00:41:52,885
Now, the challenge that typically has also is like when you're in a start-up and you're running at 100 miles an hour, being able to know when to pull over and take the rest stops, it's super important.

226
00:41:52,885 --> 00:42:01,085
And I think that the hard thing for companies that are growing companies that are moving, fast is the balance of hey we're running a hundred miles an hour.

227
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:01,785
So how do we do?

228
00:42:02,485 --> 00:42:09,285
When we understand that this is a marathon, but it's a marathon of seven minute miles, meaning that we're running constantly.

229
00:42:09,385 --> 00:42:15,585
How do we look at well-being and mental health, in that demanding type of environment?

230
00:42:15,585 --> 00:42:17,585
And that means that we have to be really intentional.

231
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:19,885
It doesn't happen by mistake, right?

232
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:31,685
So for us even signing the pledge, is us saying that really continue to invest in this stuff and yes, we have, you know, we basically have some things internally that support the balance of Mental Health.

233
00:42:31,785 --> 00:42:46,685
Health and just being well, one example of that is every Friday of the first Friday of every month, we take off as an entire company, and we dedicated to just well-being, we call it Wellness, Wellness weekends.

234
00:42:46,685 --> 00:42:49,985
And so that means that every employee has a three-day weekend, every single month.

235
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:57,385
That means that almost two weeks, out the ear because you Des 12 business days, out the year, almost 2 weeks out of the Year.

236
00:42:57,685 --> 00:42:58,585
We're shutting down.

237
00:42:58,585 --> 00:43:04,985
And we're seeing go do what recharges your As an employee at that, meaning spending time with your family.

238
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:06,885
And that means taking your kids to the park.

239
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:10,185
If that means to sleep in it, for the whole day, you go do that.

240
00:43:10,185 --> 00:43:13,285
And so that's one small thing that we have decided to do at the top of the year.

241
00:43:13,285 --> 00:43:16,685
And it's been phenomenal, but we can do so much more, right?

242
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:20,485
And so the pledge is really a pledge of continuous Improvement for us.

243
00:43:23,085 --> 00:43:27,085
Yeah, and just to mention from a site in the interest of time.

244
00:43:27,085 --> 00:43:50,085
I think one thing which we do very intentionally is that in a good area for us as a family and you know you find a safe space inside your family to share a lot of things from a mental health perspective is that you know, you don't or you can't share and if you can't share, things don't get resolved and that leads to more issues and concerns.

245
00:43:50,085 --> 00:44:09,085
So, think the spirit of family Is that you can share and that comes from, you know, starting off in India, where it's a very strong connection that you build with the family and get a very strong sense of a safe space to share anything about anyone and problem solve together without being judgmental.

246
00:44:09,085 --> 00:44:22,585
So, I know we are out of time but just wanted to share as to how do you think about a company as a family and, you know, create that environment that everyone is there for everyone for, you know, during all ups and downs.

247
00:44:24,685 --> 00:44:25,685
So good.

248
00:44:25,885 --> 00:44:26,485
Wow.

249
00:44:26,485 --> 00:44:27,885
Thank you, Abhishek.

250
00:44:27,885 --> 00:44:32,185
Thank you, Roberto for sharing your insights experiences.

251
00:44:32,185 --> 00:44:37,285
Best practices we're grateful for this time.

252
00:44:37,585 --> 00:44:50,185
All right, so we're now going to flip the switch here and move into a virtual group volunteering activity for the lgbtq+ community.

253
00:44:50,185 --> 00:44:53,285
And I would love to bring Carla to the stage.

254
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:55,085
Each will you join me?

255
00:44:57,385 --> 00:44:57,985
Awesome.

256
00:44:57,985 --> 00:44:58,585
Okay.

257
00:45:00,485 --> 00:45:03,585
Hey, thank you so much, Gina.

258
00:45:03,885 --> 00:45:11,285
What a great conversation and what a great segue into our gadara volunteering virtual volunteering event.

259
00:45:11,285 --> 00:45:12,085
I should say.

260
00:45:12,185 --> 00:45:14,985
And again, happy pride month, everybody, my name is Carla.

261
00:45:14,985 --> 00:45:23,085
Curtsinger, I am a gadara Ambassador, and I am joined by my colleague Deb who be helping me out in the chat window.

262
00:45:23,185 --> 00:45:30,085
We're so excited that you're here today for our virtual volunteering event activity.

263
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:38,585
We're going to work together to write and decorate messages of love for the lgbtq+ Elders of color.

264
00:45:38,585 --> 00:45:40,485
This is a really unique opportunity.

265
00:45:40,485 --> 00:45:52,485
You think about the world as it is today, think about being a person and a person, a lgbtq+ person Generations ago right?

266
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:54,485
A much different world back then.

267
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,685
Those people are now our elders.

268
00:45:56,685 --> 00:46:03,485
And so you get the opportunity to create virtual Nation walls to tell them that we support them.

269
00:46:03,585 --> 00:46:07,685
We know that the journey they have been through and now they're their elders.

270
00:46:07,885 --> 00:46:11,185
And obviously their communities may feel like they're shrinking as well.

271
00:46:11,485 --> 00:46:16,385
So you get the opportunity to say that we're there with them, and we want to show our love and support.

272
00:46:16,385 --> 00:46:23,385
So what a unique opportunity, thank you so much for sharing your time today and working on this activity with us.

273
00:46:23,685 --> 00:46:29,485
So why you'd expect with this is a short activity today, we're going to start out obviously we're doing the introductions now.

274
00:46:29,685 --> 00:46:31,585
We're going to do Quick Icebreaker.

275
00:46:31,585 --> 00:46:35,185
I am going to test your knowledge during pride month.

276
00:46:35,285 --> 00:46:38,585
Then I will tell you a little bit about the nonprofit that you're serving today.

277
00:46:38,785 --> 00:46:45,685
Give you some quick, a quick instruction on the activity itself and then you will have some opportunity as you can see here.

278
00:46:45,685 --> 00:47:01,285
It says make some notes, it really is creating a wall of affirmation for these lgbtq+ Elders that our nonprofit serves, and then we will take just a couple of minutes to get together and say what was that like What was your feeling?

279
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:05,885
What did you learn about yourself and about pride month working on this activity?

280
00:47:05,885 --> 00:47:09,885
So there's a lot to do a lot to learn and hopefully a lot of fun to be had.

281
00:47:10,085 --> 00:47:19,185
So let us start with those icebreakers as we celebrate love during pride month and this is, you can say is a bit of a trivia contest, and so I am going to start out.

282
00:47:19,185 --> 00:47:26,085
We're going to guess the rock star because we have musicians Among Us, who have really played a part in promoting queer culture.

283
00:47:26,085 --> 00:47:29,985
We're going to focus on one, and we're going to give you a pole here.

284
00:47:30,285 --> 00:47:32,285
Are you to guess now?

285
00:47:32,285 --> 00:47:35,385
This is one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music.

286
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:41,385
He was known for his flamboyant stage Persona and four octave vocal range.

287
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:42,385
Oh my goodness.

288
00:47:42,585 --> 00:47:46,385
I think this may have been a little too easy for you.

289
00:47:46,585 --> 00:47:51,485
I see that everybody has guessed correctly and again, you are right.

290
00:47:51,485 --> 00:47:54,185
This is indeed Freddie Mercury.

291
00:47:54,285 --> 00:48:00,085
Shown here when he appeared at Wembley Stadium, I believe that was a Live Aid concert.

292
00:48:00,185 --> 00:48:02,885
Look at him there and so sad that tragically.

293
00:48:02,885 --> 00:48:07,985
We lost him a little too early but good for you for knowing your pride trivia.

294
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:09,785
Now we're going to kind of switch gears here.

295
00:48:09,885 --> 00:48:13,285
This may be a little more challenging we're going to guess.

296
00:48:13,285 --> 00:48:22,185
There's many different Pride flags and each one kind of represents a different identity in our lgbtq+ community.

297
00:48:22,385 --> 00:48:25,385
So you have to match the flag to the community.

298
00:48:25,385 --> 00:48:26,985
So maybe this will be a little bit harder.

299
00:48:26,985 --> 00:48:28,985
It will see you seem like a smart Bunch.

300
00:48:28,985 --> 00:48:29,285
Okay.

301
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:29,985
Here's our first.

302
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:38,185
Like this is the more commonly known for a pride flag, so which identity goes with this pride flag.

303
00:48:39,685 --> 00:48:42,185
I don't know, I don't know if this is really that hard.

304
00:48:42,285 --> 00:48:44,485
I am going to give you a second to answer this one.

305
00:48:44,685 --> 00:48:45,285
What?

306
00:48:45,385 --> 00:48:48,385
What identity goes with this pride flag?

307
00:48:51,785 --> 00:48:54,185
I mean, you have to admit, some of these guesses are pretty fun.

308
00:48:54,385 --> 00:48:55,285
Oh, my goodness.

309
00:48:55,285 --> 00:48:55,685
Wow.

310
00:48:55,685 --> 00:48:57,585
I am so shocked that you got this one.

311
00:48:57,585 --> 00:48:58,285
Right.

312
00:48:58,385 --> 00:48:58,985
Very good.

313
00:48:58,985 --> 00:49:03,185
Yes, this is considered again, you got all got it, right?

314
00:49:03,185 --> 00:49:05,985
This of course, goes with the homosexual, orientation.

315
00:49:06,285 --> 00:49:08,585
And you have to admit, some of those choices were pretty fun.

316
00:49:08,785 --> 00:49:17,485
Okay, let us take a look at another flag now, that's why I may not be as well-known, but I think the answer, I think our hint is going to help you with the answer.

317
00:49:17,485 --> 00:49:18,685
Let us take a look.

318
00:49:18,685 --> 00:49:19,985
Guess the identity.

319
00:49:20,185 --> 00:49:27,785
That goes along with this flag that was designed in 1998, which identity goes along with this flag.

320
00:49:27,785 --> 00:49:31,985
Oh hey, we had a couple of, we have actually a little bit of dissension.

321
00:49:32,185 --> 00:49:41,185
This makes this more exciting for me but indeed those of you who guessed bisexual got it right now, so that's kind of new flag, isn't that?

322
00:49:41,185 --> 00:49:42,785
That was, that was a new one to me.

323
00:49:42,785 --> 00:49:43,485
So good job.

324
00:49:43,485 --> 00:49:46,785
Those of you who guessed bisexual, okay, I have got another one for you.

325
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:49,885
Here's another flag that was created for this.

326
00:49:50,085 --> 00:50:03,585
Immunity and again, introduce just a few years ago in 2018, so which Community go identifies with this flag and I think the colors are quite lovely.

327
00:50:04,685 --> 00:50:13,385
Okay again, so again we have a little bit of back and forth on this one, but for those of you who guessed lesbian, you are created correct.

328
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:23,385
So, again, whenever you go to a pride parade, you can look for that black, and here's our final flag of our trivia contest.

329
00:50:23,485 --> 00:50:31,185
Now, this is again, the, the origins of this flag are not known but it was introduced in the late 2000s.

330
00:50:32,485 --> 00:50:33,785
What flag?

331
00:50:33,985 --> 00:50:36,485
What community is this flag representing?

332
00:50:37,085 --> 00:50:37,285
Okay.

333
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:38,385
So ghetto, look at this.

334
00:50:38,385 --> 00:50:39,885
We have a 60/40 split.

335
00:50:39,885 --> 00:50:42,385
This is exciting who is right?

336
00:50:42,385 --> 00:50:47,285
And who is wrong, it is the straight Ally, okay.

337
00:50:47,285 --> 00:50:49,285
So again, I am so excited.

338
00:50:49,285 --> 00:50:55,485
There was a little bit of dissent there because I thought maybe our trivia game may have been a little too easy.

339
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:56,385
So excellent.

340
00:50:56,385 --> 00:50:58,085
Thank you so much for participating.

341
00:50:58,285 --> 00:51:01,685
Again, a lot of knowledge in our welcome room.

342
00:51:01,885 --> 00:51:03,885
So now I want to tell you a little bit about the nonprofit.

343
00:51:03,985 --> 00:51:09,985
Drop it that you're working for and because I don't know if everyone is familiar with degree out Circle again.

344
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:23,785
This is I want to tell you what, griot stands for its gay reunions and our time, and it's the only organization that's dedicated to serving the needs of the elders in the lgbtq+ people of color.

345
00:51:23,985 --> 00:51:33,885
And you can see that their mission is a great one there, just trying to eliminate all forms of Oppression, especially if you think about it, as I mentioned earlier, Elders, already deal.

346
00:51:33,985 --> 00:51:38,785
With ageism and racism and sexism and misogyny, and all these things.

347
00:51:38,785 --> 00:51:44,085
And then you, and then you include those of course, who are part of the lgbtq+ community.

348
00:51:44,285 --> 00:51:57,985
So they have to deal with a lot, and I am so happy that today, we can serve them by volunteering in this activity, so, I luckily, we have a video and that will tell you a little bit more about both the organization and the work they do.

349
00:51:58,185 --> 00:51:59,585
And we will play that for you now.

350
00:52:16,085 --> 00:52:24,085
Come a long way, but we still have not reached the top of the mountain as Martin Luther King, with Junior say.

351
00:52:45,185 --> 00:52:59,985
Sprint, older adults, especially LGBT, when we get above will be get up age, we sometimes become invisible, our issues become invisible, our challenges become on your dress.

352
00:53:00,485 --> 00:53:11,885
So we, the purpose of our organization is to put that visibility back on our community and to show, you know, communities at.

353
00:53:11,885 --> 00:53:29,685
Hey, not only are we still here, but we still have the same challenges that, you know, other individuals that have Grill single carry on in my life at a time.

354
00:53:29,685 --> 00:53:30,785
When I was really lonely.

355
00:53:30,885 --> 00:53:37,985
I was just watching TV and saw the thing on we're circling and can remember and it gave my life a purpose that I didn't have for a while.

356
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:29,685
So again such a worthy organization and these affirmation walls, these digital affirmation walls that you will be creating two are really again to just send out notes to this community these Elders to let them know that we are thinking about them that we understand.

357
00:54:29,685 --> 00:54:33,285
As you can see here, they face dual discrimination.

358
00:54:33,485 --> 00:54:39,485
And that we want to know that there are people out there that are supporting them and it's all of us collected here today.

359
00:54:39,685 --> 00:54:44,185
And, so I am so happy that you have the Community to take part in this activity.

360
00:54:44,485 --> 00:54:45,885
So how is this going to work?

361
00:54:45,885 --> 00:54:48,085
Because we want to make this as easy as possible.

362
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:52,385
Well, first of all, is to think about what you're writing and of course know your reader.

363
00:54:52,585 --> 00:55:00,385
So again just to remember these are elders and their lgbtq+ so they again that's important to know who your audience is.

364
00:55:00,685 --> 00:55:02,485
So you want to avoid any trigger words.

365
00:55:02,485 --> 00:55:11,385
And one of the first things you will notice is we called them Elders because there're many things that you can call people who are of a certain age that they do not appreciate it.

366
00:55:11,485 --> 00:55:12,785
Elder is one that we have found.

367
00:55:12,785 --> 00:55:22,885
That is it gives them the respect, they deserve without some of the negative connotation and then of course, we want to use the neutral pronouns, which is so important to this community.

368
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:28,885
So we want to use the, the appropriate pronouns so that we don't run into any triggers there as well.

369
00:55:30,085 --> 00:55:32,185
Now again this just reiterates.

370
00:55:32,185 --> 00:55:35,685
What I just said again, you want to make sure your language is sensitive.

371
00:55:35,685 --> 00:55:36,485
It's simple.

372
00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:37,485
It's supportive.

373
00:55:37,485 --> 00:55:37,985
It's warm.

374
00:55:37,985 --> 00:55:38,885
It's positive.

375
00:55:38,885 --> 00:55:40,585
This is an affirmation wall.

376
00:55:40,585 --> 00:55:44,485
So everything there should be positive upbeat and supportive.

377
00:55:44,985 --> 00:55:51,185
Now here, just some sample messages and I like these because they tend to be concise you see everything from.

378
00:55:51,285 --> 00:55:52,485
You know the very first one.

379
00:55:52,485 --> 00:55:54,685
I want to tell you that love has no gender.

380
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:56,385
Love is never wrong.

381
00:55:56,385 --> 00:55:58,985
You are more than your queer and gender identity.

382
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:03,285
All the way to the one at the bottom hope is never silent, right?

383
00:56:03,285 --> 00:56:09,385
So there's a, there're many things you can say that will make them feel seen and supported and loved.

384
00:56:09,385 --> 00:56:11,585
And that's what we really are going for today.

385
00:56:11,985 --> 00:56:21,485
Now, these are things, they recommend that you avoid, you can see again, they reiterate that you want to be positive but you don't want to be glib either.

386
00:56:21,485 --> 00:56:22,785
Like, don't worry, be happy.

387
00:56:22,785 --> 00:56:24,885
It's a little flip, a little glib.

388
00:56:24,985 --> 00:56:38,985
And also if you are an ally as I am, you don't want to say, I Understand what you're going through because as someone who is just shy of being an elder and who is an ally I don't, I can never understand what they have gone through.

389
00:56:39,185 --> 00:56:46,485
And so, you want to make sure you're supportive, but you don't try to grab their Journey as your own because none of us truly can grab.

390
00:56:46,585 --> 00:56:48,885
Can understand truly understand what they have gone through.

391
00:56:49,285 --> 00:56:51,085
So just make sure you're supportive.

392
00:56:51,485 --> 00:56:54,585
But, you know, don't try to appropriate what they have been through either.

393
00:56:55,585 --> 00:56:57,185
Now here are some basics do's and don'ts.

394
00:56:57,385 --> 00:57:05,585
Again, we ask that you avoid Any messages directly about religion or faith because again you don't know exactly who this is going to.

395
00:57:05,885 --> 00:57:09,085
Again we say positive and supportive but maybe the fourth or fifth time.

396
00:57:09,085 --> 00:57:15,485
I have said that and again try to keep them concise and short and you will see once my colleague dep.

397
00:57:15,485 --> 00:57:22,685
If he hasn't already in the chat window shares, the templates that were working with really, short messages are going to work really well.

398
00:57:23,185 --> 00:57:35,585
Now, another thing I want to mention in the template, you may see that we tried to make it as easy as possible for you to work on these, but you may feel like you want to add something to the designs, we have already given you.

399
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:41,885
You may want to add an image, but we want to make sure you don't run into problems with copyright sharing.

400
00:57:41,885 --> 00:57:43,085
Copyrighted images.

401
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:44,985
So these websites.

402
00:57:44,985 --> 00:57:49,685
And again, I will ask Debbie to share these in the, in the chat window as well.

403
00:57:49,685 --> 00:57:54,485
So you can refer to them is that these are all open source web sites.

404
00:57:54,485 --> 00:57:58,285
So anything you find on these websites, would be copyright free?

405
00:57:58,285 --> 00:58:02,385
So I just want to make sure You have your own list of these that you can reference.

406
00:58:02,385 --> 00:58:06,285
So you make sure that you don't run into any problems with potential copyright issues.

407
00:58:06,885 --> 00:58:08,685
Now again, how do we do this virtually?

408
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:15,485
Well again, we have developed a template, it is a slide deck and you can download it to your local computer.

409
00:58:15,585 --> 00:58:19,685
It should work with whatever slideshow program you prefer to use.

410
00:58:19,685 --> 00:58:25,485
You just download it locally, open it up, and each slide is its own little template, and you have a few to choose from.

411
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:34,285
So you pick the one that you like, and then you start adding Words, adding copyright free images and really think about remember your audience.

412
00:58:34,485 --> 00:58:39,185
They are Elders with elder eyes and even at my age, I have trouble reading.

413
00:58:39,185 --> 00:58:44,785
So you want to think about, I want to make the text I use as high contrast as possible.

414
00:58:44,885 --> 00:58:48,385
So, think about if the background is like, the text should be dark.

415
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:51,885
If conversely, if the background is dark, the text.

416
00:58:51,985 --> 00:58:58,885
I may have just said that, but you want to make sure that if you have a dark background, white text on a white background, dark text.

417
00:58:59,485 --> 00:59:00,985
Now, what does this look like in the end?

418
00:59:01,185 --> 00:59:02,785
Well here's a sample of the templates.

419
00:59:02,785 --> 00:59:03,585
One of the templates.

420
00:59:03,585 --> 00:59:04,385
You have three or four.

421
00:59:04,385 --> 00:59:05,385
I think to choose from.

422
00:59:05,485 --> 00:59:08,285
If you fill it in, boom, right?

423
00:59:08,285 --> 00:59:18,285
So you can add text, you can add copyright free images, you can see here, there's some of these are quotes, some of these are just, you know, little messages that were written themselves.

424
00:59:18,485 --> 00:59:21,285
So that's what your affirmation wall can look like.

425
00:59:23,385 --> 00:59:26,485
And then of course this is something we will also put in the chat window.

426
00:59:27,285 --> 00:59:31,385
You will want to name your affirmation wall which would be one slide.

427
00:59:31,385 --> 00:59:38,785
You would save that slide or wall individually named it you see here and then you will upload it to the link.

428
00:59:38,785 --> 00:59:45,985
And you can see here, you don't have to finish today because we know we're all going to have, you know, maybe less than 10 minutes to work on it.

429
00:59:46,085 --> 00:59:51,785
You can get started here, you have up to two weeks to complete this activity up to two weeks.

430
00:59:51,885 --> 00:59:54,185
So you can brainstorm Get started.

431
00:59:54,285 --> 01:00:00,285
And then after our sessions over today, you can finish and you can send it to us when you're ready, okay?

432
01:00:01,885 --> 01:00:07,085
And again, devil set will share this in the chat window where it will be a link that you can click.

433
01:00:08,285 --> 01:00:15,685
So, I want to start designing, I want to take a second though and see, if there are any questions that have come in and do our Q&A window, or Q&A panel.

434
01:00:15,985 --> 01:00:20,285
I don't see any right now, but if anything has come into the chat window as well.

435
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:29,485
I see all the information that Deb has shared which I appreciate but I want to see if anyone has any quick questions.

436
01:00:29,585 --> 01:00:41,485
What I would like to do is let us start designing, and we can spend probably the next seven or eight minutes designing, and then we can come back together and talk about it really, really quickly.

437
01:00:41,585 --> 01:01:01,485
Before we close our, today's session with, with Gina, I don't see any questions now but if you want to just start designing now and if any questions come up you can share them in the Q&A window or the chat window, I will be checking both, and then we will come back together.

438
01:01:01,485 --> 01:01:05,285
Like I said in about Seven minutes.

439
01:08:20,085 --> 01:08:21,685
Such a great exercise.

440
01:08:21,885 --> 01:08:22,885
Now, welcome back.

441
01:08:22,885 --> 01:08:23,585
Everybody.

442
01:08:23,585 --> 01:08:27,085
I am just really curious to see, I know this.

443
01:08:27,085 --> 01:08:43,285
That was a short period of time to work on our activity and some of you may have just gotten started or be halfway done, but I wondered in that in the chat window, if you could describe the process of working on your affirmation while in one or two words, how would you describe it?

444
01:08:43,785 --> 01:09:01,685
What was it, like, working on this affirmation wall for our lgbtq+ Elders at the, at the garrote Circle, what was it like You may still be working, you may still be in the middle of your PowerPoint slides going.

445
01:09:01,885 --> 01:09:02,885
Not now Carla.

446
01:09:02,885 --> 01:09:03,685
I am working.

447
01:09:04,685 --> 01:09:06,285
What was it like working on these?

448
01:09:09,385 --> 01:09:11,785
Enjoyable Janet says it says fun.

449
01:09:11,885 --> 01:09:14,185
That's you know that's exactly what I want to hear.

450
01:09:14,185 --> 01:09:16,085
That makes me happy Valerie.

451
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:17,285
I see that you mentioned.

452
01:09:17,285 --> 01:09:20,785
You're trying to work on your text boxes and PowerPoint.

453
01:09:21,085 --> 01:09:22,585
Yeah that can be sometimes.

454
01:09:23,484 --> 01:09:38,285
Yeah Janet see Janet is giving you a that's what I was happy to get some advice on that double clicking the text in the text box and I think that power points allows you to like rotate them and that way you will be able to get it in the box at that we provide in the template.

455
01:09:38,285 --> 01:09:41,585
So hopefully And it's Janet advice will help you.

456
01:09:41,984 --> 01:09:52,285
Yeah, we really want these to be enjoyable and fun and like I said, you have a couple of weeks to work on these, so I know that all of you are, probably if you're like me, you want it to be perfect.

457
01:09:52,984 --> 01:09:57,585
And I believe we might have someone that wants to share theirs.

458
01:09:57,585 --> 01:09:58,585
That's in process.

459
01:09:58,585 --> 01:10:00,385
Do we have someone that wants to share theirs?

460
01:10:00,885 --> 01:10:02,185
Look now here's one.

461
01:10:02,485 --> 01:10:05,585
This is actually, our producer Jessica was working on her.

462
01:10:05,585 --> 01:10:07,385
She really wanted to get hers going.

463
01:10:07,785 --> 01:10:08,785
This is amazing.

464
01:10:08,785 --> 01:10:08,985
Jess.

465
01:10:09,185 --> 01:10:11,985
Sakura, for such a short period of time.

466
01:10:12,385 --> 01:10:14,985
So she has love has no gender.

467
01:10:14,985 --> 01:10:15,585
You are loved.

468
01:10:15,585 --> 01:10:18,085
Just as you are thanked you for being you.

469
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:21,485
You're the reason why so many can be their true selves.

470
01:10:21,485 --> 01:10:26,085
Wow, that's amazing, I hate nothing about you and then thank you.

471
01:10:26,485 --> 01:10:29,185
That's beautiful, what a great job.

472
01:10:29,185 --> 01:10:32,785
Wow a lot of I need to get, so I need to get some claps on that one.

473
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:39,785
So again, everyone out that if yours is still in process, keep working on it again, you have two weeks to go this.

474
01:10:40,085 --> 01:10:43,985
And all of the links that Deb provided will still be viable.

475
01:10:44,185 --> 01:10:46,385
It was such a pleasure working with you.

476
01:10:46,385 --> 01:10:52,585
Today, I am going to turn it over to Gina, and she's going close out the meeting for you Gina.

01:10:57,585 --> 01:11:04,385
That was an awesome exercise and I could see how it just brings that.

480
01:11:05,185 --> 01:11:14,885
