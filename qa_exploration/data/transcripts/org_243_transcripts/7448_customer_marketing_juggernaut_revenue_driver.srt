00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:51,900
Hello and welcome to today's Spotlight interview with Nick Bennett, who is the director of evangelism and customer marketing at Alice.

2
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,400
We are so excited to dive deep into what he's up to.

3
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,100
And so we're going to talk about evangelism in general.

4
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,400
What is customer marketing, dive, deep into why that's really important, especially, as we move into.

5
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,600
23, where it could be a down.

6
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
It's a down market.

7
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,000
So we need to be innovating and being good stewards of the business in general.

8
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,800
So I am really excited.

9
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,700
Nick, will you join me here on stage?

10
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,000
Hey, hello, how are you?

11
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,000
I am doing great.

12
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,300
How are you doing?

13
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,900
I can't complain.

14
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
It's a beautiful day outside.

15
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,500
Okay, so where are you tuning in?

16
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,100
From II?

17
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,800
Think I have got a map here that shows us sell our producer.

18
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,500
There we go.

19
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,700
Okay, so you're in Boston, I am all the way out here in Hawaii.

20
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,400
That's its like it's look how far away we are that.

21
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,700
But look, we're still here together.

22
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,100
Pretty amazing.

23
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,400
What time is it for you?

24
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,700
It is 220, 2 PM nice.

25
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,900
Okay, 9:02 PM or am sorry here.

26
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,700
So we have definitely got that distance between us.

27
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:14,400
However, what's amazing is, we could still be in our the same virtual room and hanging out together today.

28
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
Absolutely cool.

29
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,800
Well, Nick, tell us a little bit about what you're up to these days.

30
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,900
Yeah, so, you know, my in my nine-to-five we at Alice would like to do things.

31
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,900
So like everyone knows what you are and your 9 to 5 and so for me I run evangelism and customer marketing analysis.

32
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:39,500
I am a traditional field Market or an ABM Better for tech companies and for the last 10 or 11 years.

33
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,200
And then what we like to really talk about is the 529.

34
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,800
So what are you passionate about outside of work?

35
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,800
And so for me I play baseball still competitively, you know, I like to do a lot of fun things.

36
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:04,500
I love New England Sports, absolutely devastated me that Bogaerts signed with the Padres this morning, I was cursing the front office most of the day.

37
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,800
So, you know, hey die-hard Boston, sports fan and I have a four-year-old daughter.

38
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,300
Who honestly means everything to me and everything I do is for her.

39
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,000
That's amazing.

40
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,400
Well, we definitely were tracking with that baseball.

41
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:27,800
Fun fact, so Sal I went ahead and put that up there but yeah, jumping into some of these fun facts.

42
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:56,100
You know you got baseball so just so you know for me I used to do The movies television back in the day and I actually did a lot of background work for Ugly Betty, and she was awesome and it was fun playing these like we did these like Japanese Entourage Fashion Group type of, type of roles.

43
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,800
So that's one of my fun facts.

44
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:09,900
But there's another fun fact about eunuch that we would love to share and you were a rapper.

45
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,900
It was, right?

46
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,700
I went through a phase in high school.

47
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,100
Yeah.

48
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,300
Yeah.

49
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,800
It was something I went out and bought all the expensive stuff.

50
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,200
I had someone that mixed and produced all my music for me and it still floats around the internet.

51
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,500
All these years later.

52
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:42,200
Well, in fact, we have got this track right here and I have got to play this a friend of mine.

53
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,300
You got to get together to buy.

54
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,500
I have got my hat here.

55
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,700
Get out.

56
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,200
All right.

57
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,200
Can I put this on the chosen son?

58
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,500
And it's just your luck.

59
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,100
You about to Bear witness.

60
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:17,800
I got acid ronschuster CD as yeah any day, but they will be stepping on the see white Shades Boston fitted in a disc.

61
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,400
Three.

62
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,000
I think my track is my campus in the pain to my heart.

63
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:54,300
So for this, I still Blood, Sweat tears, and love, just so you can feel the inspiration from above Thanks for letting me play around, be little goofy with you there, but that's pretty dope.

64
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,000
You're very talented, Nick.

65
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
I like to do a lot of different things.

66
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:05,600
You do a lot of different things and you're handling it as a girl, dad, so lots of Kudos and props to you.

67
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,600
Thank you.

68
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,400
Hopefully that wasn't embarrassing.

69
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,400
Are you all right?

70
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,300
That we played that?

71
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,500
Yeah, absolutely.

72
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:20,900
Yeah, it's funny cuz I will share like that song randomly as I like, you know, we could be at Like trivia or something, like I will just drop in.

73
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:30,100
Then people like I had no idea, and I was like yeah I went through like it was like a two or three-year thing and it's just it's crazy that it just still flow.

74
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,000
I mean that's the internet for you just floats around there forever.

75
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,900
Hopefully in like 30 years it will still be there.

76
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,100
For sure, it's a great track.

77
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,500
I am impressed with your lyrical Rhymes there.

78
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:45,800
Cool.

79
00:08:45,800 --> 00:09:08,500
Well, you know, customer marketing as we dive into this topic, there was this one fact that I got from Bain & Company and the research shows that a 5% increase in customer retention can increase profits by 25% to 95%.

80
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,700
I mean that is insane and it's like, okay, why aren't we?

81
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,600
Holding down more here.

82
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,500
Can you just Define for us?

83
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,200
How do you define customer marketing and yeah, I didn't see it today.

84
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,700
Yeah, it's you.

85
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,300
So I want to kind of guess put it out there, so I have actually never done customer marketing before.

86
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,000
So this is all new to me, like I said, I am a traditional failed marketer, ABM marketer.

87
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,800
That's what I have done.

88
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:44,700
I was actually in sales before I moved over to marketing, so I have walked in sales is shoes which I feel like made me such a good feeling.

89
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Field marketer and ABM marketer because I understood how it all worked.

90
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,200
I understood the stresses of not being paid, your quarterly commission, and things like that.

91
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:07,900
So it was probably earlier this year before the market started to get really crazy and in my boss at the time was like, hey what do you think about moving over to customer marketing?

92
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:15,700
And there's going to be a strong focus on retention from the board and I said, cool, I am all for new Challenges.

93
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,000
I like to be a better well-rounded marketer.

94
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:29,300
I said, I am up for doing it, but I want evangelism as a part of it, and we can get to that later, how I broke that down, but my goal was to help with the nir.

95
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,600
So like their net revenue, retention side of it.

96
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,300
And I think that marketers today, you know, the customer marketers, get it, absolutely.

97
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,800
That NR is in is so important.

98
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,800
However, so many other marketers don't really focus on that, as a metric.

99
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:59,000
And I think that you should actually be focusing more on Nar today, then a lot of the other metrics that marketers are focusing on because we all know it costs less to retain a current customer than, to acquire a new one.

100
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,300
So why wouldn't you double down your efforts on that and that was really the whole thing?

101
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,600
And for me my goal is and it's, you know, again, I want to preface this.

102
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,700
It's a little bit easier when you Market to marketers and you are the ICP and you know, exactly the pain points.

103
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:26,100
They're looking to solve because you were looking to solve it for all these years and I have just been able to really jump on with customers strategize with them.

104
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:34,200
Focus on the social proof aspect the customer stories and not just fluffy customer stories because some let us be honest like who writes a bad case.

105
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,500
Study no one puts bad case studies out there.

106
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,300
Why would you talk bad about your company?

107
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:45,300
But when you can get tactical with a customer story and turn that into a Playbook, now that not only does that help with retention, Tension.

108
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,700
But it also helps Drive acquisition as well.

109
00:11:48,300 --> 00:12:02,700
So those are some of the things and honestly, it's even more alarming a little bit that leaders within companies, specifically in Tech right now are actually laying off customer marketers and keeping acquisition marketers.

110
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't agree with that.

111
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And I have seen layoffs affect a lot of customer marketers.

112
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,700
Unfortunately, within the last couple of months, you would think that is the one piece in the marketing.

113
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:23,900
Or that you want to double down on and I don't see why more companies don't put more resources and money behind it.

114
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,400
Do you think that could just be because customer marketing?

115
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:41,400
I mean, how long has it realistically been known and the practices the disciplines, the ROI, the attribution, calculated around it like, is that really understood today?

116
00:12:42,700 --> 00:13:02,100
I think the people that have I am doing it for a long time and I know I mean to me I have had to rely on a lot of these resources because it was some wasn't something that came like first nature to me, and so I have talked to a lot of customer marketers some that have been only been doing it for, you know, two or three years and some that have been doing it for 15 or 20 years.

117
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:12,600
So there is people in larger companies usually is where you see it you know you like the IBM's of the world and you know, HP things like that.

118
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Like they have had customer marketers.

119
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,100
Ever.

120
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,600
Have they been focused on different things and can customer marketing like should they build a customer Advisory Board?

121
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,100
Should they be focused on just driving, you know, reviews or something?

122
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,600
Should they be strategizing?

123
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,000
I think it's evolved a lot over the years for sure.

124
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,200
And I have always as a marker to talk to customers.

125
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:44,600
I can't I guess yo tell how important that is as a marketer, that you should be talking to customers and not just talking to them taking what they're saying and actually doing.

126
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:55,200
Do something about it, but to create programs, specifically built around retention and expansion upsell opportunities has been newer for me.

127
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:03,200
And I feel like I have done a lot that has made an impacted short time because I don't want to live, like, could I retention rate?

128
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,800
Be better.

129
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,300
Absolutely right now, 100%.

130
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,800
And I think everyone realizes that.

131
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,600
And so the programs that we're putting together is hopefully making an impact on that.

132
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:21,100
And I can already see a lot of The result even within the last five months, and it's trending, like, kind of like hockey stick style up.

133
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,100
So, alright, so let us go back a little bit.

134
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:34,700
Rewind, I would love to dive into your story into just even how you got to becoming the Evangelist customer marketing, Guru that you are today.

135
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,400
Take us back a little bit.

136
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,000
And how did you get into B2B marketing?

137
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah, so completely by luck to be honest with you, so I went to school for sports management.

138
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,700
Like I said, I played baseball, all my life played in high school, played in college and I went for sport management.

139
00:14:51,700 --> 00:15:03,500
And when I got out, I said I am going to be a big shot athletic director at a D1 school, or I am going to be a sports agent or something like that, and when I got out turned out, none of those were true.

140
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,500
I could go sell tickets for the Red Sox making $10 an hour, and I was like, oh, that doesn't sound.

141
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,100
Very fun.

142
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,000
Like why did I go to college for that?

143
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,100
But to be honest, I wasn't also a great student.

144
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:22,300
I cared more about baseball and I feel like being a marketer actually relates really well, the baseball and Sports in general, I feel like it's being someone.

145
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:33,000
Athletic is kind of made me a better marketer because kind of you know teamwork everything plays together really well, but I said okay, well, this isn't going to pay the bills.

146
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
My parents told me I needed to get like a real job.

147
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,700
And, so I said, all right, I am going to go into sales inside sales.

148
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,100
It was as for a tooling company, and let me just tell you like, that was boring.

149
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:52,400
Like I hated I was doing inside sales and I had to show up at 7 AM and work till 5 PM in sit at like an old computer.

150
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
It wasn't even a laptop.

151
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,800
It looked like it was from like the 80s, and this was like in 2000, like 12.

152
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:07,900
So, it wasn't even like that long ago and like I sat there and just took calls from basically General Foreman construction workers about like, industrial tools.

153
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,600
And like, I would go pick them out back and like, basically sell them and I had upsell them and all these different things.

154
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:20,500
So I never did sales for Tech, but I did sales for them and then I moved into Motorola actually.

155
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,600
And so, I ran Channel sales for Motorola after their AT&T account.

156
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:36,600
So at the time I was going up against the iPhone, every release for September, and we were trying to outsell them, and I had to come up with creative ways to get their dealer channel to want to do that.

157
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,300
And then I moved to like a channel marketing role which was still working within the same.

158
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:50,300
I had the whole East Coast for a Titi ta Titi indirect dealers and I would just work with them to kind of figure out spiff, programs and incentives.

159
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,800
Contest trainings.

160
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,300
All of those.

161
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:52,800
Things.

162
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,900
And I was like, oh, this is cool.

163
00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:01,800
I don't have a quota hanging over my head, but I get to do all these fun things and travel, and I was young at the time, so I was like, oh, traveling is great.

164
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:10,500
And then I went to another company, I moved into another Channel marketing role and then that allowed me to move into my first field marketing role in B to B Tech.

165
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,500
And it was the first true role that I ever really did.

166
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:14,900
I remember?

167
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,500
It was a company called Simplicity.

168
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:22,300
They were in the hyperconvergence space just outside of Boston years ago, a lot of EMC.

169
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,200
CMC people for people that know, EMC out there.

170
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:41,400
And I was like, this is so fun, like we get to do all these crazy things and at the time our CEO is telling us don't buy your yacht yet like we reached a billion dollar valuation in 23 months fastest in the it space to reach a billion dollar valuation.

171
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:51,300
And I remember all the sudden we had an immediate like all hands meeting and it was like HP bought us for 600 million and be.

172
00:17:51,300 --> 00:18:08,600
I felt bad because I was Only there for like a year and a half of people that were there for four five, six years, basically, they were getting nothing for their time because everything was under water at that point and then that was kind of like my I just kind of didn't look back at allowed me to start to do field marketing for a lot of these other B2B companies.

173
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,100
And that's kind of what I have done for the last eleven ten or eleven years now.

174
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,600
Wow.

175
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:14,900
Okay.

176
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:24,500
So walk us through how you got into evangelism and customer marketing specifically, yeah, so the It was in pieces, is interesting to me.

177
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,800
I have always, you know, looked up to people like sangram when he was at Terminus Ethan.

178
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,900
Buuck, who's that, bom, bom, Randy from Uber flip.

179
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:47,800
Like these people that have Chief evangelist titles, and I was like, wow, they're like out there evangelizing for a product and Company and in the it space I always saw Advocates as kind of like evangelist but I feel like it was developers.

180
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Like it was very interesting like I couldn't fit that because I was not a developer But I said, you know what?

181
00:18:53,800 --> 00:19:00,500
I said, Mar Tech in sales Tech is lacking this type of role from a non-executive standpoint.

182
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,100
And so when my boss came to me and said, hey would you be open to doing this?

183
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,500
And I said, yeah, but I want this.

184
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:20,100
I am going to tell you exactly why I said I feel like I have already been doing a lot of these things of, you know, helping be the face for the brand doing all these events, the podcasts, the prospect calls and customer calls.

185
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:27,400
I said I want to actually help Leave the path for what it looks like for non-executives to take to do these types of roles.

186
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,200
And I can tell you like, he was like, absolutely.

187
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,900
Let us pitch it to the leadership team.

188
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,600
So, I got on a call with the CEO, ocfo like everyone and I pitched it.

189
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
I said, this is why I think I should do this role.

190
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,500
And I said, B2B companies and more Tech and sales Tech don't have it yet.

191
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,100
You want to be at the Forefront of this.

192
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,600
I am telling you, and there was no pushback.

193
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,700
They're like, yeah, absolutely.

194
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:56,200
Like you're a perfect fit that role, And now you're seeing more and more people start to get these types of roles.

195
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:06,400
I mean, I think of people like Jen Al, and she was at the Challenger, she did just leave, but like her, you know, will Akin Nick Posey, Arthur Castillo from Chile, Piper?

196
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:18,800
Like, you're seeing more and more non-executives take on these evangelists /, like Creator type roles and I think from an evangelist perspective, your kind of mixture of things.

197
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,300
So like you're a subject matter expert you are out.

198
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:31,600
Are evangelizing on behalf of the product and communities wherever your ICP is meet them where they are, but you're also a Creator in a lot of regards.

199
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:40,500
If you look at a lot of people that have these types of roles, they're regularly creating content on LinkedIn on Tick-Tock, on all these other social media platforms.

200
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:48,500
And I think when you go to a company, say, hey, by the way, I have, you know, 40,000 followers on LinkedIn.

201
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,200
You know, all these on Tick-Tock, we should create this.

202
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,200
Type of role.

203
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,800
It's a lot more appealing, especially in the more Tech world.

204
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:08,500
And I do think, as we move into 2023 you're going to see more B2B companies start to either create these types of roles in Elevate people internally or start to externally bring people in.

205
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,700
Because I do think the Creator economy is going to blast off in B2B in 2023.

206
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,800
That makes total sense.

207
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,300
When do you think the chief evangelist?

208
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,700
Like this whole role really started to take traction?

209
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,100
How many years ago months ago?

210
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah, I mean I think the chief evangelist role has been around.

211
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:37,200
Like I think I like saying I am from even like I mean, I don't know how long he's been doing it but like he's been doing it for a while like I feel like Randy from Uber flips.

212
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,300
Been doing it for a while.

213
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,200
Ethan like you have these types of people that have done these roles for a while.

214
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:50,700
However, I do think The like the outcomes that you're looking to achieve from these roles are very different.

215
00:21:50,700 --> 00:22:03,800
Like in, I could tell you no one really has figured it out because I have asked probably about 20 to 30 people how they view, this specific role in everyone is very different from like how do they track it?

216
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:09,200
And measure it to what are the actual like objectives that they're looking to complete?

217
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:09,900
Yeah.

218
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,200
Could you walk us through?

219
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,500
What?

220
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Some of those objectives looks like look like even for yourself and then What are you tracking?

221
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,900
Yeah, so I think it's, you know, a big piece of it is external community building and participation.

222
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:29,100
So, like if you're a martyr tech company, for example, you want to be active where your prospects and customers hang out.

223
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,900
If it is in, let us just say Peak Community or rev genius or Pavilion.

224
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,800
Or I mean there's so many slack communities out there and Discord communities.

225
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,300
Now like just being active there.

226
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,300
You want to join the events and sessions to better network with your I see.

227
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:55,200
You're not selling them anything, you're just building those relationships so that when the time comes, they keep you top of mind, you just want to be in that conversation, ultimately from there.

228
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,700
The product has to do everything that you want it to and live up to the standards and the hype and all that.

229
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,200
But that's the first thing.

230
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:12,300
The second thing is internal employee advocacy and I feel like this is an important one because if you think about it and I will just give you an example.

231
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,300
So in 2020 to my content on LinkedIn.

232
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,700
Alone will drive about 12 million views.

233
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,300
So about a million views.

234
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,700
A month is what my content is driving on LinkedIn.

235
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,800
Now, you take, I post on Tick-Tock, I post on Instagram reels, YouTube shorts.

236
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,600
You take that, you amplify all that.

237
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Now, cool, you have one Nick now, what about all these other employees that are creating content or want to create content?

238
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,600
Think about that.

239
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
There's no cost associated with this.

240
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,200
It's just time.

241
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:52,100
And getting people to better understand how you like what are the outcomes that you actually want to achieve from that all of a sudden, say LinkedIn?

242
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,200
For example, you get 15, 20 employees creating their own content.

243
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,500
You're driving 15, 30 40, 50 million views a year.

244
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,600
Think about what you would pay an ad spend for that, it's through the roof.

245
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,500
Especially as ad spend continues to go up.

246
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:17,800
So, employee advocacy is a huge piece of it and I think that there are companies out there that kind of produced Like software and products to help support that.

247
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,800
I have been doing everything just from a manual standpoint myself because it's more.

248
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,900
So educating and people who are afraid to click post for the first time.

249
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,000
But if you just get them to share their stories and you don't want them to talk about the company.

250
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,900
If the come someone wants to hear about your company, they're going to go to your website.

251
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,200
They're going to go to other channels corporate handles.

252
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:52,400
They're not going to LinkedIn to hear me talk about Alice for example, they I go and I try to Share value But ultimately When I am getting, you know, 15,000 views to my profile, every 90 days, and they're clicking.

253
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,500
And they're saying oh by the way, he works for Alice, let me go see what Alice does.

254
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,700
Oh they're gifting company huh?

255
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,800
We use a gifting company we're up for Renewal I am gonna go check them out and submit a demo in how did you hear about us?

256
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:11,700
I am going to put that, I heard Nick on LinkedIn or from this podcast, so we can use self-reported attribution to tie everything back.

257
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,200
So that's that piece side.

258
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,600
The third piece is influencer marketing.

259
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:36,200
So again, I think this is you can look at it as like the Creator economy, influencer marketing, whatever it is, but it's working with the key people in your industry that you want to have promoted your company, your product, your mission, everything through that and yeah, you know, one off, engagements are cool and stuff.

260
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:45,300
But if you can build long-term engagements and ultimately create an in-house type of environment, we have creators that you eat that, you know, they work for the company.

261
00:25:45,500 --> 00:26:00,200
Benny, But ultimately they're doing their own thing and you just have all these people that are going out there and doing their own thing, it can do some serious damage and I think that's going to be another huge Topic in 2023 is influencer marketing and how to B2B companies leverage it.

262
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,900
Because b2c has a figured out really well.

263
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:08,100
B2B is still lacking behind there, the other ones, a prospect calls and customer calls.

264
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,000
So I joined seven to ten calls a week between Prospect or customer calls.

265
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,400
Yeah.

266
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:25,200
And it's not just sitting there at a no value like, Like I am leading these calls through strategy, through brainstorming sessions, and that's where I think the customer marketing piece plays into it as well.

267
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:33,600
It's like, great helping current customers retain them figure out if they're a makes any sense for upsell or anything for prospects.

268
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:40,400
And that's where from a customer marketing standpoint, those relationships should start at the prospect level and you should be working your all the way through.

269
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,300
Don't just take that hand off after they close a deal and when CS gets it, jump in.

270
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,800
Start to build Advocates from there.

271
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:53,100
You should be building Advocates from Way Beyond that, so that's that piece the external speaking and networking.

272
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,600
So for me, that's a big one.

273
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,000
So, like I in the last two years I have done about 90 podcast as a guess.

274
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,100
And so that has helped me kind of again, Drive awareness for, for the company.

275
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:15,200
And so Alice like I will single-handedly this year, do a million dollars in pipeline myself, just from organically creating content, and I am proud of yourself.

276
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,600
Reported after best nap for that just for a moment there.

277
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,100
That's pretty amazing.

278
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,300
Yeah, how much of that do you think we will close?

279
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,000
So probably about 60% base.

280
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:44,600
Yeah, it's I mean, I did 500k the year before in 250 close, so 50%, and our win rates are up and I feel like everything is better products in a better spot than it was a year ago, so I can see 60 to 70 percent closing easily and that's just again literally zero cost you.

281
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,200
No nope.

282
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,500
Pay two heads were run or anything from that.

283
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,900
It's just solely people coming in from self-reported attribution.

284
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
That's amazing.

285
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah.

286
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,600
And then the last thing that I was going to say is just from an evangelist and point.

287
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,900
Like you want to take these insights and learnings in figure out how to infuse them back into the business.

288
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,800
Because if you're out there and you're hearing all these things and you're not relaying this information or if you're not taking action on them.

289
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,800
What's the point?

290
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,900
It's like any marketing rule like you could hear all these things from a customer, you understand, the issues.

291
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,600
But if you just sit on it and do nothing, you're not going to win.

292
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,300
So to walk me through what that looks like?

293
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,300
Yes.

294
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:30,800
You're going across all of these different channels and opportunities and getting the word out there.

295
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,100
You're getting insights.

296
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,200
What does that look like tactically and sharing with your team?

297
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:35,800
Yes.

298
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:46,500
So it's quarterly presentations on kind of the learnings, from calls from events, from what the General market says, in its data to back it up as well on top of that.

299
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,000
And so we can see specifically how the market is trending.

300
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,100
How people are thinking about?

301
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,500
It in.

302
00:28:52,500 --> 00:29:00,100
Fortunately, I have a lot of friends that work at competitors, and so I am a lot of friends that are customers at competitors.

303
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:07,200
And, so I am able to kind of triangulate a lot of this information, so it helps make that roadmap better.

304
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,600
Because again, if you're hearing all these things in XYZ product feature is in on your road map.

305
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,900
Well, these 40 people said it should be, and they're choosing these competitors because of it.

306
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,000
You would think you want to get that.

307
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,800
That on your road map ASAP.

308
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,700
And so those are a lot of the things in.

309
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:35,800
So I usually put out a deck every quarter, that kind of highlights all these things plus a video and I usually presented in person, I mean virtually as well.

310
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,800
And this is with your team at Alice.

311
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,900
Yeah, exactly.

312
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,600
So it goes like, there's two different versions.

313
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,300
There's a leadership, like SLT like senior leadership version and then there's a marketing like version.

314
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:54,600
And there's a general company version, like just slightly changing the talking points and things like that, and kind of what's being shown.

315
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,300
But yeah.

316
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,600
What are some of the key things you highlight at each of those levels?

317
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,200
So to senior level because that gives me an idea of like the outcomes of what success look like.

318
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,900
So what do you present at that?

319
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,600
Your level.

320
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,400
Yeah.

321
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,100
So I think it's the ability on how are people thinking about the brand Affinity.

322
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,600
It's like, you know, great, are you increasing Revenue per quarter?

323
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:28,900
Are you engaging a certain percentage of customers per quarter or are you increasing customer satisfactions, which ultimately Drive higher MPS, surveys in scores?

324
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:39,900
Are you kind of getting a you can you showcase your attribute like a positive association with in the Brand and that's engagement things like that?

325
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:46,600
I mean, the senior leadership's, like numbers, you know, they're like, Yay, why would I invest in something like this?

326
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:56,900
If it doesn't produce Roi, but I feel like a lot of what I do 80% is tied to revenue programs and 20% is brand or experimental.

327
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:06,800
And I feel like this evangelist type role is somewhat experimental because some of the things that you could do, like, let us just take this me and you talk right now.

328
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,200
Now, you cut this up, there's micro-content.

329
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,300
You start tagging me.

330
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,000
All these people.

331
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,400
See it.

332
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,300
They click my name.

333
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,700
They go see what Alice does cool.

334
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
You just help me drive a ton of pipeline.

335
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,700
Thank you.

336
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,700
And like yeah, we can attribute some of that.

337
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:31,300
But what if people don't specifically you know say they heard about me from you or self-reported attribution just doesn't fall in a way that you wanted to.

338
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:38,700
I think the second piece is dark social or word of mouth or however you think about it and like if I go Tell ten people after this?

339
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,700
Hey I just did a session on welcome and you should go check it out.

340
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,300
If you're looking for a virtual event platform, that's not directly attributed but it's me telling 10 people.

341
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,200
And I feel like my word would hopefully hold a lot of weight with those 10 people.

342
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,600
That's good.

343
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,200
Wow.

344
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,600
Okay.

345
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:02,100
There is a question from Jeanette that we can pull up here.

346
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,800
How are you measuring self-reported attribution and how do you gather the data?

347
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,600
Yeah.

348
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:24,200
So basically, I am pulling Salesforce reports of anyone that has mentioned my name specifically and so it's been a little bit easier because I will see about two to three inbounds come in per week with, with my name, and we drive.

349
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:29,100
I mean, how we drive about 160 demos per month right now.

350
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:36,800
So it's a sizable amount, and I am seeing people start to put my name and Tick Tock next to it as well.

351
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:46,300
Which is a little bit newer because funny enough, I actually don't talk about Alice, it all in my Tick Tock, it's just, it's not an ALICE page, it's my own personal page.

352
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:55,900
But what I am doing is repurposing a lot of content that I create on LinkedIn and then creating videos of that and then posting it on tick-tocking Instagram rails.

353
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,600
And it's a completely different audience because not so many people from B to B, you're on there yet.

354
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,100
But the organic reach is absolutely like through the roof.

355
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,800
So really just pulling it down.

356
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,400
Yeah.

357
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:15,300
Really pulling Salesforce reports for people that are using that specific field which we make it a requirement in our demo form.

358
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,900
On how did you hear about us?

359
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,000
So I was just going to ask about that.

360
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:26,800
Yeah so you have to fill it out and there's a couple other questions as well, and we have been tweaking some things to see how it works.

361
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:34,100
If people at answer more favorably, if we do things, but we had the drop down box for so long and it was like as marketers.

362
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:49,100
We like to put people in boxes and when you hit when You go to a demo page and you hit that drop down box, more than likely you're in a click that first thing and it's usually like Google or something like that and like that's why everything gets attributed wrong and that's another whole conversation, honest.

363
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,900
That's right.

364
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:57,700
But yeah, Wow, that The Tick Tock point is so interesting to me because I am just curious.

365
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,700
Like, are those actually qualified leads that come through, are they B2B?

366
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:09,699
And yeah, I think I can tell you, I can tell you in the last two weeks, there's been, there's been two.

367
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,500
And one is from a 20,000 person company in our ICP.

368
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,900
In one is from a 4500 person company.

369
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:32,300
So for those people in Executives out there that say that Tick Tock is not for be I call BS and it's an absolute lie because I can prove that B2B should be on Tick Tock and should be producing content.

370
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,699
There.

371
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,800
Mmm.

372
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,300
That's really interesting.

373
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,300
What are your thoughts on Instagram?

374
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,699
Facebook Twitter, so, so Instagram.

375
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,199
All I am really doing with Instagram.

376
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,600
I am using Instagram, reels to repurpose, Tick-Tock content over there, and again, it's a different audience.

377
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:55,600
So, like the people that are following my Instagram reels have been Went from Tick-Tock have been different from LinkedIn, so it's cool.

378
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,300
It's like three different platforms.

379
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,900
I don't put anything on Twitter and Facebook.

380
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,700
I don't mess with anything with their either.

381
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:11,600
But the interesting thing is let us just say LinkedIn decides to kick us all off tomorrow, and we all go to LinkedIn.

382
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,100
Jill.

383
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,600
What happens?

384
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,200
You don't own the audience on any of these social media platforms, that's the issue.

385
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,000
Mark, like just every anyone thinks that like they own that audience.

386
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:47,400
So If LinkedIn kicks me off tomorrow, my 41 thought a thousand followers goes by, like I have nothing and so that's why I am now creating an email list because that is the one thing that you do own you create that email list which feeds into a newsletter which feeds into all these other channels for me personally and yeah, like I mean, it's my personal thing, not an ALICE thing but ultimately the brand still is associated with who I am.

387
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,100
That makes sense.

388
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,400
Wow, okay, so that's a ton of content creation.

389
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,800
I am on your side.

390
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,500
Do you have?

391
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:04,400
Like are you the one man Agency or how are you getting all the editing, the shooting, the writing previously done.

392
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,100
So it's all just me outside of the podcast.

393
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,800
The podcast, I do have a company that's been with me in Partnership for two years now.

394
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:22,200
But as far as like the LinkedIn creation, then taking that, and all I am really doing is say, I write a, I will get used today is an example.

395
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,300
I Needed, a text post around, 20 23 ideas.

396
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:32,100
For events that are in person ways that you could use product tours, things like that.

397
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,400
All I did was take my phone record myself repeating.

398
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,200
What that text post was?

399
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,400
Which takes me about five minutes maybe less than that.

400
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,700
It took me five minutes to write that post.

401
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,400
Five minutes to shoot the video.

402
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:52,500
I throw it into an app called captions, which will automatically put captions into it and then I just hit post on tick tock.

403
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,800
On Instagram rails and post on YouTube shorts.

404
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,000
In the whole thing.

405
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,700
Takes me 15, 20 minutes, max, nice.

406
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,600
Okay.

407
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,900
And then you have, like, a way of calendaring these out.

408
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,700
Like, how do you organize your content right now?

409
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,400
Yeah, I don't do it very well.

410
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,200
I can tell you that, I have always been the type of person that doesn't write anything down.

411
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:29,200
Like, I hate taking notes, like any of my And it's / like spur of the Mind type thing, like I will be usually in the shower and I will try to remember what it was.

412
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,200
By the time I got out of the shower to my phone, but I don't schedule anything out.

413
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:46,900
I don't write anything in advance unless I know I have to like post something specifically about ass like certain topic but like 99% of the time, it's just whatever comes to mind in.

414
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:55,200
Like, for me I am a very out overanalyze, and I am very indecisive, so, if it takes me longer More than five minutes to create any type of content.

415
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,900
I just won't do it because then I start to overanalyze, is this going to actually make sense?

416
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,100
And I am just like, who cares?

417
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,900
Like, if you read my stuff, like this, grammatical errors.

418
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:10,300
Luckily grammarly saved me a bit but like, I don't, yeah, I run on sentences all the time.

419
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:10,600
I don't care.

420
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,100
It's all about, just getting it out there.

421
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,500
That's a really key point of advice.

422
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:22,400
I think for Content creators anyone out there interested in getting into evangelism is like the analysis paralysis.

423
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:22,900
Cisco.

424
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,600
I think that happens.

425
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:31,000
So often with content creators where you're like, getting really nitpicking and then it's like, I don't know if I should even put this out.

426
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,100
And by that time, you have already over, thought the whole thing?

427
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah.

428
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:47,800
But it's so true and it's like, you start to hit backspace and like you write the same thing as 10 times and then 45 minutes passed and then you're like I am not even gonna post this time to frustrated right now, but like who cares?

429
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,300
Sometimes you just gotta send it.

430
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:57,100
Like whom, you know one thing I noticed the first time I am I posted content, is this always going to be people who don't like it and who cares?

431
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,300
That's why I made this hat.

432
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,200
That's why I made this.

433
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,000
I have a merch line and specifically around the creation.

434
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:10,900
Yeah, it's like haters hate creators create that's, there's always going to be people who hate what you do in this going to be people that tear you down, trolls that are out there.

435
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,700
Who cares?

436
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,300
Like don't let them get in your way and like that's what a lot of people.

437
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,500
There's so many mental barriers that people need to overcome, and they're afraid that people are going to not like what they say.

438
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,400
And that's okay.

439
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,200
Your content isn't going to be for everyone.

440
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:36,700
Just like yo Alice is content isn't going to be for everyone but it doesn't matter because it's going to reach the right people and that's what matters at the end of the day, so where can I go to get that hat, I will have to link you.

441
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,600
It's yeah, I have got hats, I have got hoodies.

442
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,200
It's I wear this everywhere.

443
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,700
Now drop the link in chat, so we can all get our hats and Sport your swag.

444
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,300
Absolutely, that's awesome.

445
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,300
So talking about content.

446
00:39:52,200 --> 00:40:01,300
If we go into your content strategy as an evangelist, like, how do you balance the content strategy that you work on?

447
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,200
Like, how do you think about that from a, like, a Content pillar perspective?

448
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:15,700
You know, Alice has its core product Services offerings and there's a key, you know, direction for that brand, but then there's your brand.

449
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,200
So how does that all work?

450
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,800
In determining prioritization.

451
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,100
And what Is like what's going to hit the mark with your audience's.

452
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:31,400
So I think you know the benefit are a fortunate thing is that the Alice brand is kind of like out there.

453
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:41,000
It's a fun brand like people like we're not like robots like even like when you look at the stuff from our corporate handle it's value-add it's like fun.

454
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,100
It's Christina.

455
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:51,400
Does a great job with like are like social media but like there's we don't try to be stuffy or something that were not and I think that's why it.

456
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,200
Me so well because that's how I am.

457
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,400
It's authentic.

458
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,900
And if you can't be authentic in the content that you create, people are going to see right through it.

459
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,600
Same as marketers.

460
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:10,200
It's like when someone prospects me, it hits a copy and paste job that anyone could see from a million miles away and then gets mad that you're not going to take a 30-minute meeting with them.

461
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,500
Like come on, do a little bit of research on me.

462
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:18,700
I give you all of this information on my LinkedIn and yet people still don't do research like in the last.

463
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,800
I would say two weeks.

464
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,300
I have gotten about 45.

465
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,900
Five prospecting emails and Linkedin.

466
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,200
DM's guess, how many of those have been personalized one?

467
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,300
And it's crazy because I give those all this information is in my LinkedIn profile.

468
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,900
If you just took five minutes of your time to check some things out, you know, I love baseball.

469
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:46,600
You know that I have a daughter, you know, I love New England Sports and that I am devastated about the Red Sox right now but people aren't doing that.

470
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,200
And so for me like the content that I create, it's all about authenticity.

471
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:51,800
Nicely.

472
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,100
And so, you know, good example, when I have been doing this for three years.

473
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,400
So, when I started three years ago, I only talked about field marketing, and I was the only one on LinkedIn.

474
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,000
The talked about field marketing on a consistent basis and what it actually meant to a revenue organization.

475
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,300
So think about that one person out of 650 million users at the time.

476
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,000
Crazy.

477
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:20,400
And then I started my podcast at the time, which was on personal branding and I started to talk more about that and I lost being associated with the marketer.

478
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,400
People would reach out to me and want to talk personal branding building an audience, but they didn't want to talk marketing.

479
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:33,200
And I was like, oh, man, that kind of devastates me because like, I feel like the content I want to create is really around marketing.

480
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,400
And so a couple months ago, I said, you know what, I feel like personal branding.

481
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:38,900
Yeah.

482
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:45,900
You should absolutely do it, but I said, I feel like it's so played out, like, you can't scroll LinkedIn more than five minutes without seeing a post around it.

483
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,800
And so, I said, I said to my production team that does my podcast.

484
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,300
I said, I want to end the podcast.

485
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,600
I want to create a new one.

486
00:42:52,800 --> 00:43:03,100
I want to get back to being known as a marketer, and I said, I am going to start to create content around customer marketing influencer marketing, Creator economy, interest Marketing, in general.

487
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,600
And I said, this will help me get back to being associated to a marketer.

488
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,100
And the new podcast is a marketing podcast.

489
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:18,100
And I feel like all of these things, it's starting to tip the tables a little bit more, and it's going to take a little bit of time.

490
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:25,000
But like I am trying to avoid talking about personal branding and building an audience, like, at least first.

491
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,100
I want it to be marketing first that second, mmm.

492
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,600
That's good.

493
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,800
Thanks for breaking that down.

494
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
We have a question that's relevant to this.

495
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:35,800
Let us pull up.

496
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,600
Spencer's, question, what's the best way to generate authentic content?

497
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,700
Whoo, yeah, conversations is definitely important.

498
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,800
Like, I feel like we're all working on projects and ultimately the best LinkedIn.

499
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:57,400
Is when you're sharing your experiences Lessons, Learned things that you're doing in your everyday life.

500
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:04,200
So that me as a marketer, if I see what you're doing, and I am like, who like and you talked about a failure or something like that.

501
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,500
I try to avoid those steps so that I am not making the same mistake.

502
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:14,600
Or if you're having a huge success, you're sharing that I am trying to replicate it myself to whatever process that I need.

503
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,400
And I feel like that is the most authentic content.

504
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:29,100
Like when people are sharing hey these are the five things that At I did that resulted in XYZ cool and I will give you another good example, cute.

505
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,700
I think it was cute to aq3.

506
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:38,800
I drove a bunch of G2 reviews, I think it was like, 83 that ultimately drove and I drove with 70 something in two days, and I am credible.

507
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,400
Thank you.

508
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:39,700
Yeah.

509
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,500
And I posted the entire Playbook on a LinkedIn post.

510
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,900
I said, this is the exact email I sent.

511
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,400
This is how I segmented the audience.

512
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,200
This is how I got the MPS.

513
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,000
This is literally the email and everything and it blew up.

514
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,900
It had almost 2,000 likes on it.

515
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,400
Hundreds of comments on it.

516
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,700
I got a lot of hate from G2 competitors.

517
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:16,800
Actually, people that tried to Blackmail me and like, tell me that I was doing like illegal that it was crazy, but ultimately that drove over 100,000 views with just one post.

518
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:30,000
Well, I feel like those types that type of content is something that I personally love to put out there in any role that I go building and public is incredibly important to me and like having a company support that.

519
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,600
And yeah I am not out there.

520
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:40,100
Sharing are you know, growth numbers or anything like that, but I am sharing exactly what I am working on and sharing it as much as I can.

521
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:45,400
Because I feel like that's going to help the next marketer, hopefully be in a better spot than they are today.

522
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,300
Wow, that's great.

523
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,000
You will have to share that g to review.

524
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,200
LinkedIn's post with us early, so we can pull that Playbook.

525
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,400
Wow, this is incredible.

526
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:02,800
So evangelism works as a channel for you and the, and we're seeing some direct Roi.

527
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,300
Direct Revenue come through.

528
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,900
Let us talk a little bit.

529
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,300
I know we have only got 15 minutes left, believe it or not.

530
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,300
Let us talk about customer marketing.

531
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,000
A little bit more.

532
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,500
You touched it at the beginning of our conversation.

533
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:31,900
And when you and I spoke prior to this convo, you're really unpacking some of the processes and like, how you work with the customer success team and how your structured organizationally with them?

534
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,300
Can you give us a little double?

535
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,000
Click into the customer marketing strategy?

536
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,200
Yeah, absolutely.

537
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:46,000
So I guess kind of little bit of background, so we went through a layoff a couple weeks ago and so marketing was a 10-person team down.

538
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:46,800
On 24.

539
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,700
So we have basically dissolved marketing and I report to our VP of Cs now.

540
00:46:52,700 --> 00:47:01,100
So I am incredibly aligned on the retention side of the business, the other members of the marketing team report to our VP of sales.

541
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,900
And that's another whole conversation.

542
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,500
I don't know if I personally believe with it, but it is what it is.

543
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:13,000
So, I am incredibly aligned to the programs that customer success is running.

544
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,400
I understand the process is, I understand I am literally, A huge part of their team.

545
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,200
And like, we all work really, really well together.

546
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,700
And so, for me, I try to break down what I am working on through three different things.

547
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,100
Really?

548
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:34,400
So customer communication emails and I, so I send them out from our VP of CS2, all yet.

549
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,600
End users on a bi-weekly basis.

550
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:48,600
I create the email for her, and I am really trying to keep these short and concise with the video from her and then kind of little bit about product updates or features or Things like that or things that they should know about.

551
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:59,600
I am actually I just wrote one today that's going out next week that kind of is like a year in rear interview, talks about all the Integrations, all the donations that we did, things like that.

552
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:10,400
So I am really excited about that and the feedback from customers has been through the roof one, the part of the issue is you can use in-app messaging which is awesome.

553
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:22,600
However, with our product specifically, we if you are using Integrations, you We don't need to go into Alice which means that in at messaging is only getting the 30 to 40% of our users.

554
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
Which what happens to the rest of them?

555
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,300
We weren't actually emailing anyone before that.

556
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,600
We were just relying on in-app messages.

557
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,800
So them hearing from us is a huge win.

558
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,500
The other piece is g 2 reviews.

559
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,400
Understand, social proof is incredibly important.

560
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:46,000
Plus all these gold nuggets that you can then pull out and start to use for the sales team for the Cs team start to figure.

561
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:51,900
Out what features in what use cases are more prevalent than not has been huge?

562
00:48:51,900 --> 00:49:01,300
And, so I mean in the last two quarters I think I have about 140 reviews into quarters.

563
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:07,200
That has given us tremendous feedback in tremendous results and it comes specifically for me.

564
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,500
So I record a video that says, hey I am I am asking for a GT review in exchange.

565
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:28,200
I am going to send you a gift, not a gift card because I think things should be But Power of Choice, you can use it if you exchange it for a gift card, if you want and I say email me back, if you want to give me feedback on the product, hop, on call, whatever.

566
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:39,600
And I can't tell you how many customers want to hop on a call, want to talk through things wanting to just get better insights, we were able to up sell a bunch of companies.

567
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:47,400
We were able to retain earlier in the contract companies that maybe we wouldn't have I have done till like later.

568
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,300
So that's another huge thing and then the third thing is the customer stories.

569
00:49:51,300 --> 00:50:08,200
So again, we had customer case studies, I feel like they were fluffy, and I am going to give you a good example because I like giving examples, Sixth Sense is a customer of ours, and so we released a story last fall and it said 6 and sees five hundred and thirty-seven percent ROI increase.

570
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,100
And as a marketer, I read that headline.

571
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,100
Is it click baby?

572
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,000
Maybe I didn't come up with it but I want to know exactly.

573
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,100
We how they did that.

574
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:27,000
What is the Tactical like step-by-step that they did to get that Roi because we serve a similar audience like I want to replicate that and it didn't talk about that.

575
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:35,800
And I said, you know what, when I took this rollover I said I want to redo these stories and I want to focus on the Tactical aspect, and so we have released four of them so far.

576
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:45,900
I am redoing the six cents, one, it's actually just in production right now should be coming out next week, but I can tell you it is very, very tactical, goes into their secrets.

577
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:53,800
Sauce, how they do everything, and I feel like these stories have been tremendous, because we're running paid ads around them.

578
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,800
Now, we're running them for our sales team in Cadence's.

579
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,500
It rbdr team RCS.

580
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,800
Team is leveraging them.

581
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,500
Our website, traffic has been through the roof.

582
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,000
Oh, no.

583
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,800
Did I disappear?

584
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,300
You did?

585
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:08,700
Hold on.

586
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,600
Sorry, it's all good.

587
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,400
It's your fancy setup over there.

588
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,000
I think I am that you could try refreshing.

589
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,800
That's weird.

590
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,800
Hold on, I don't know what that's never happened before.

591
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,100
There's your little Avatar.

592
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,300
Oh, most there, there you are.

593
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,200
That's weird.

594
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,400
That's never happened before.

595
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,500
Sorry about that.

596
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,100
Oh, it's all good.

597
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:53,900
Cool.

598
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,700
But yeah, that's, you know, that's, that's the base of what I am doing.

599
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:12,000
I am actually building on a customer Advisory board right now as well, because again, why be reactive in the feedback that you're getting, why not be proactive and seek this information out from your top customers.

600
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:18,800
So I have uh, I built a few versions of decks, and we're going to start to explore that as a 2023 initiative as well.

601
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:27,600
Love that there are some definite actionable strategic tactical points you offered here.

602
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,000
We have got about nine minutes left.

603
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,100
I did want to answer Janet's.

604
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,900
Got a question here.

605
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,800
And it has to do with employees.

606
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:41,100
How do you give your employees the parameters for posting content?

607
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,600
What do you think of AI for generating content?

608
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,900
So I don't think you should give parameters to employees for posting content honestly.

609
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:57,100
Because why would you want 30 employees saying the same exact thing that's just copy and pasted?

610
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:04,100
And I can tell you I did an in a vent and I started to get tagged the other day.

611
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:21,600
From about 20 employees that must have used some type of software and just clicked repost because it was literally the same wording from all of them in the same video clip and like yeah like that's cool but like you know there's no authenticity behind it's like you know someone's basically telling you.

612
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,500
This is what you have to post whereas with no parameters.

613
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,300
Hey like everything is fair game like yeah, talk about things that you're passionate about.

614
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,200
Ultimately, it's still going to impact the business.

615
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:43,900
I am not saying like don't go out and like, Not talk about the company to share cool stuff because ultimately people buy from people, and if you can showcase that and build relationships with people, that's going to be awesome.

616
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:54,600
On the AI side, I have been playing around with the chat G PT, 3 things, and it's interesting because I actually wrote I wrote anything.

617
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,200
I said, what does evangelism and be to be mean to you.

618
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,400
And I must have stumped it because I got like a blinking cursor.

619
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,500
That came back at me, and I was like, oh yeah, this thing is Going to steal my job.

620
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:12,900
I am not, I am not too worried so, but yeah, I mean, it's honestly it's way better than anything that's out there right now.

621
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:27,800
I can tell you that, like, I have used it for I am seeing like Tick Tock videos that Engineers are using it to basically like figure out like coding and all it just basically writes code for you and like all these other things, I think it's going to be really cute cool.

622
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:33,600
But I don't think you should 100% rely on it because it goes back to your point of authenticity, right?

623
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:41,200
And at some point, I mean, the challenge is some of these AI generated content pieces to feel authentic.

624
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,500
But then, at some point you can start to see, like, oh, is this a?

625
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,900
I generated like, as a person, consuming the content, I will question it.

626
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,500
You know, actually so awesome.

627
00:54:52,500 --> 00:55:02,200
All right, well, I would love to close our time with a point of advice or encouragement that you have for the B2B community.

628
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:03,800
Yeah.

629
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:15,100
It's you know, I would say going back to my new pad podcast, which is called the anonymous marketer people submit questions anonymously, like the it's not about the right or the wrong answer.

630
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:22,500
It's about starting a conversation for the B2B marketing community and I would say, don't be afraid to ask these questions.

631
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:29,800
I feel like so many people when the pandemic happened, they turned to communities, and they were asking questions in there because they didn't want to be judged by the companies.

632
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,500
They worked for now.

633
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,800
There's so many of your colleagues in bosses that are in these communities as well.

634
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,600
People are still feeling uncomfortable.

635
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:47,400
So I wanted to start something that allows people to create anonymous questions and hopefully myself and a guest can dive into this.

636
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,800
And a good example, I am releasing the first episode next week, but it's around career growth.

637
00:55:53,100 --> 00:56:01,800
And one of the questions I got was it's so hard to find a mentor if, especially, if you're not in a big city, like Boston, New York or San Francisco.

638
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,400
How do I go about?

639
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:02,700
Out.

640
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,100
Finding a mentor because I feel like I need one.

641
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,700
And it was like, that's so many people are dealing with that as a marker.

642
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,900
It hits home because I haven't had a mentor up until a couple few years ago.

643
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,300
I didn't know where to turn.

644
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:18,300
No one told me where to go, find him our mentor and then the second question was around.

645
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,100
I actually feel like I know more than my boss at this point.

646
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,600
What do I do?

647
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:31,700
I could sit here in Coast for another year, but I feel like I am doing myself a disservice by doing that and I feel like that's again.

648
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:36,000
I mean I have been in That spot where I feel like I knew more than my boss but like what do you do?

649
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,100
If there's no other ways to go around like you're just kind of stuck there.

650
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:52,900
Yeah you could Coast but it's we go deep on to these types of questions and I think it's going to be really helpful for B2B marketers to kind of explore like hey this is impactful for me.

651
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,300
In this does help me in my career.

652
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,700
Disappear again.

653
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,200
Right, next.

654
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:07,900
We lost your video again, but we could still hear you say, okay, your podcast is coming out.

655
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,900
Is it next week?

656
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,400
Yeah.

657
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,300
Next Wednesday.

658
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:10,700
Yep.

659
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:11,400

660
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,400
