34
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,000
Awesome.

I handed over to you, Emily.

36
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,000
Hi, everyone.

37
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,100
I am Emily.

38
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,000
I am a technical marketing manager.

39
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,400
Over a troll Works where an account based platform focused on helping our customers deliver or in find and deliver.

40
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,300
Their most high-quality leads, I have been a troll works for about three years and super excited to chat with you all today.

41
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,800
Thanks, Emily.

42
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,600
Daniel.

43
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:15,100
Oh, hey, sorry, I am having some technical difficulties here but hopefully everybody can hear me.

44
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,500
I head up the SDR team here at roll.

45
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,600
Works been doing it for it.

46
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,900
Would take about 15 or so years and just love the space.

47
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,200
I have been with companies like Marketo, semantics Aruba Networks and so forth.

48
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,800
So very happy to be here and To be with this amazing panel.

49
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,900
Thanks, Daniel asuman.

50
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,800
Hey, Gina Suman CEO and co-founder of Marco equally excited to be here.

51
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
As part of the panel.

52
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:55,800
Similar to what Brian said, what we're building at Marco is really centered around, making the human kind of connection through experiences more accessible.

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,200
So, so excited to be here Great, thank you all.

54
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Alright, so, you know, in this age of big data and automation, it's so important.

55
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,400
I mean, even more than that, let us layer on what's Happening across Tech with layoffs and recession uncertainty.

56
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,600
So, even more.

57
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:28,300
So, in the sea of emails ads calls, it's like, I feel like every B2B marketer is completely Reinventing how they approach marketing with tighter budgets and being a lot smarter.

58
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,500
Smarter and more performance data driven.

59
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:42,900
So human centricity across the customer journey is going to stand out over the others and you know, how we're defining human to human marketing.

60
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:54,000
And I would love to hear each of your definitions to this too, but it's a way you can see and interact with your customers as human first and customers second.

61
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,300
So let us unpack this a little more how to each of you.

62
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,500
Human to human experiences.

63
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,300
In go-to-market across each of your relative areas of responsibility.

64
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,300
I can hop in here.

65
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,300
So I think I was thinking about how to answer this question.

66
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,800
And first of all, in my opinion, how you think about like marketing or sales?

67
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:28,400
Just generally is helpful and so to us, you know, marketing and sales is really educating customers and then kind of selling your offering ultimately.

68
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,600
But a lot of people talk about sales and marketing really is being able to find customer pain.

69
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,900
And so they're not going to folks are going to listen to you as customers and purchase from you.

70
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,799
If you don't really Understand their problems.

71
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:51,500
So for us I think you're much more likely to find that pain if you come at it from a human angle so you actually have empathy for your customers and I think you mentioned a couple of themes.

72
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,900
One is like big data and how do you kind of Leverage that but also, how do you be human at the same time?

73
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,000
And I think those aren't mutually exclusive to us, right?

74
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:18,700
So you can still have a robust kind of data me, analytics, and use those to measure kind of how ethicacy of your marketing programs but still show up as a human still listen to your Various still use that to inform how you show up in individual interactions, as well as how that manifests in your overall brand and your value proposition.

75
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,200
So yeah, I think fundamentally, you know, having that as part of how you view marketing is a function to us is super important.

76
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,200
Little bit duplicative to that is, it's all about the connections.

77
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:49,700
You create with the people you're speaking to and, you know, in an age of video that has completely turned our Outreach upside down, the human connection is much harder to make without walking through the hallways and sitting in a conference room with your clients and Prospects.

78
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,700
So finding new ways to make those connections is vital to the growth of, you know, marketing and sales organizations.

79
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,400
So having I am these new opportunities to do.

80
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,100
So, through companies like mine.

81
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,500
It's a do.

82
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:11,000
So, and Marco and roll words, these are just things you have to have in your Tech stack in order to create these connections moving forward.

83
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,500
So it's all to me and to us, it's know so it's all about.

84
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,500
What is that human connection mean and how do you get there quickly?

85
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:27,900
For me, for me, from a marketing perspective, I really do think about human to human experiences.

86
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:35,600
Like I think all of you said is as finding those pain points that your customers are having and really providing them with those actionable Solutions.

87
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,700
And then I am also thinking about how we can get really focused on the Right audience for those programs.

88
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:49,200
So using all the data at our fingertips, thinking about how I can make my programs be more one-to-one or one too few?

89
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Even if they are one of the few, how can I make them feel more one-to-one?

90
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:04,700
So part of that is just getting really focused on who has the highest likelihood of buying right now who's raising their hands wanting to talk to sales and then really tightening up that messaging.

91
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,900
So you know what your audience cares about?

92
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:13,400
You're not throwing out 20 different messages at once and just hoping one sticks were able to deliver the right message every time.

93
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,900
Yeah, that's something that I just wanted to Echo.

94
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,000
You know what Emily said, right?

95
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,100
We tend to talk about, you know, being empathetic, being personalized and so forth in our Outreach.

96
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,700
But like before you even get to that point, right?

97
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:39,700
I think you need to take a, you know, broader, you know, look at things and really think about it from a 30,000 foot view what that really means, right?

98
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,700
So for us it's really taking that customer Obsession that everybody.

99
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,900
It's about its one of those buzzwords and operationalizing it, right?

100
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,000
So what I mean by that is you know Emily talked about this, right?

101
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,300
Reaching out to the right people with the topic that they care about, at that time, right?

102
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:04,400
So we have Technologies today that are available to help us get a lot more focused, you know.

103
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,200
So we're not, you know, spraying and praying sort of speak, right?

104
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,300
Or even in a situation where you try and personalize the message, but it's not the right message at that time.

105
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,000
It's a miss, right?

106
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:33,600
So as much as you want to do that, you know, good work of, you know, getting into the weeds personalizing really looking up, you know, someone's background or doing research on the company, you got to step back a little bit and just make sure is this the right company and the right person to reach out to at this point, right?

107
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,200
Because that's going to be a huge, huge piece of it.

108
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:44,700
The other thing that I like to think about that, we do really well here internally, you know a troll works, is it?

109
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,800
Not just about the handoff these days, right?

110
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,500
It's a lot about the cross functional overlap, right?

111
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,600
It may be a situation, Emily, what?

112
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,200
Then I will talk about this later where, you know, there is an initial hand off, but then it gets Revisited, right?

113
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,600
Like she's just going to jump in afterwards then nasty.

114
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,900
Our team is going to jump in and so forth, right?

115
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:13,100
So you really got to think through this in terms of the human to human component, from operational perspective as well.

116
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,700
And not just coach people.

117
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:21,100
People to talk about, you know, specific items that, you know, or messaging that's going to be relevant.

118
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,100
Yeah.

119
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,600
Oh, go ahead, jump in.

120
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:32,900
No, I was just going to say I think it's sometimes helpful to giving anecdotes for some of these things we can't talk about it.

121
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,400
Conceptually.

122
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,100
So give one which is what we something we were doing with internally with their team.

123
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:44,300
So Marco helps companies build culture through event so that could be virtual personal TD Retreat.

124
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:58,700
And one of the things we do, and we're trying to operationalize to delete danilo's point is we did a retreat for a company went well but then now we're operationalizing kind of pre and post sale kind of conversations and Vague.

125
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:28,000
And I joined one yesterday with a great company and mental health space and learned a lot from a human who was a customer and a happy customer but then walked away with their from the conversation with the head of sales saying, oh these are you know various things we did clarify within our offering or improve and this is how we're going to sell again, but that's almost like a nice knock-on effect but really the important thing was we were able to form a human connection and really View.

126
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:36,800
Do the relationship as a partnership versus just kind of transactional sale, which I think is really helpful, particularly, we're fairly early stage, right?

127
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:51,000
So for us, getting feedback from customers is truly, I mean, I think it is always a gift, but it's particularly more so a gift as you're, as you're really kind of iterating on the product in the offering to us, that to me, that's a good example.

128
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:58,000
And then I attended an event yesterday with a company called Mutiny, which is basically they optimize your landing pages with kind of AI.

129
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,100
Really cool company.

130
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:06,300
And one of the individuals there have looked into me and, you know, looked into what Market was, and that sort of thing.

131
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,100
And, and we had a good conversation.

132
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,500
And then we both talked about how we might build work together, help each other, and so that, but I will remember that person, right?

133
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
And kind of their story.

134
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,800
And so, at the end of the day, we are all human rights.

135
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,400
All of us on this call and all the folks listening.

136
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,800
So, I think that's important to keep in mind, especially in a time when things can be quite stressful.

137
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:41,600
And you're kind of Doom scrolling on the news and Twitter and then just sometimes reminding yourself that like the person on the other side of the conversation is in kind of row in a spreadsheet that you're trying to optimize, but they're human being is helpful.

138
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:53,500
Yeah, and I want to Echo that, right because a lot of times, you know, what happens is people you know really fixate on the short-term, right?

139
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:53,700
Sure.

140
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,600
We all have a quarter.

141
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,200
We need a head, right?

142
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,000
It's cute for we got a closed business.

143
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
CL from a Str perspective.

144
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,400
How do we build that pipeline, right?

145
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:11,600
And see that immediacy but, you know, to your point sumon on this one, you got to think about, you know, building that relationship.

146
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,800
You got to think about the long game and a lot of people on the collar like, well, that doesn't help me right now.

147
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
Yeah, it doesn't.

148
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:28,000
But it will come around right, and so I always, you know, talk about this from an SD, our perspective, it's not just about book in the meeting right now.

149
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:35,400
Oh, it's about, you know, incorporating, you know, the nurture piece of it into the equation.

150
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,400
It's not just the responsibility of the marketing team to do that.

151
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,300
You got to do that from a sales perspective.

152
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:49,000
You got to do that from a Str perspective, you know, so much spot on man with building that relationship.

153
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
That's, that's, that's what it's about.

154
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,900
That's really powerful.

155
00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:06,700
What you're beginning to describe, especially with the I meant the one team alignment between sales and marketing to really make that human touch authentic and meaningful across the funnel.

156
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:23,000
I would love to double-click a little bit more into the strategies like a cross across a process, but before we go into strategies and tactics, you know, we were talking a little bit about some of the vital qualities of human-to-human marketing.

157
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,400
So just continuing to unravel a little bit more of that.

158
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:33,900
Meaning like, okay, so we're talking about being human and yeah, it's like, duh, we should know what that's like.

159
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,100
But what is that?

160
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,700
What are some of the key qualities that you all are seeing?

161
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,800
That's translating over into the work that you do?

162
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,000
I think the human to human interactions.

163
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,100
Are obviously their personalized, transparent authentic, but at the same time, something really important.

164
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,000
There's their also really timely.

165
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:14,100
So, as marketers and the salespeople, we have so many data at our fingertips, that we can use to really Target somebody with the right message at the right time, the right buying Persona, so I Rovers freezing, our own product to define journey stages, basically, buying stages that I work with Noah, and his team on defining.

166
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,100
It's kind of two-way street.

167
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,700
There were able to get a really clear picture by a combined combining data from our CRM.

168
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,000
So that's like sales engagement or marketing.

169
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,800
Automation platform, more of those like form fills campaign responses, intent data and then website engagement to get a really clear picture of where somebody's at in their buying journey.

170
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:44,400
And from there, we can really zero in on, you know, the people that are sales ready, raising their hands and from the marketing side we're going after those folks with air cover.

171
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:56,900
Odds, nurture, emails Etc but then from the sales side, Nolan has teams using that information to really reach out to those people at the right time and were able to identify what message is going to work right for them.

172
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:10,100
And then even create Dynamic campaigns that can change the offer or message depending on when the final stage changes to really, just support the sales team and stay top of Mind against competition.

173
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,800
Yeah, just to add to that, just very basic things that are really important.

174
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,600
It's, you know, I think the know who you're talking to piece really helps create that experience.

175
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:37,100
If you know, you're going to be speaking to someone who is in a VM, why you talk, while you tell them how your use cases for sales of Client Services can benefit them, they don't care, right?

176
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,300
So if you create the conversation on what they care about, that's really important.

177
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,900
And that alone will create this personal Human Experience because now you're having a conversation about what they really care about.

178
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,700
Sometimes you just miss the basics.

179
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,900
Hmm.

180
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,900
So can we dive into some of the tools?

181
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,100
Like what our strategy and tools that you're starting to touch it?

182
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:11,000
Emily, you know, cross funnel, but what are some key strategies and tools that, and we can start from even at the awareness part of the funnel and let us make our way all the way through.

183
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:19,200
So just from that initial touch point because there was a recent Forrester stat that said that it requires close to 27.

184
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,700
All touch points for the average B2B buyer.

185
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,400
These days post pandemic.

186
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,200
It might even be more than that.

187
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,400
And majority of that exploration of the buyer is taking place so low and that's how they want it.

188
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,400
So how are we making that experience human?

189
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:48,900
Well, I mean, I am a little passionate around this, you know, in and I get a little irritated by the stats.

190
00:20:49,100 --> 00:21:02,300
You know, because I will be honest, you know, you hear these stats and it's, you know, and what happens, you know, you have the SDR is that are basically adopting that, right?

191
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:12,700
And you got Str teams that are like emulating that and, you know, quite honestly, you know, Actuated and reinforcing that narrative, right?

192
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:23,700
Because will hero, you got to have a sequence as, you know, 13, 14 touches, right and Outreach or salesloft, or, you know, whatever tool you're using out there.

193
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:36,300
And as opposed to figuring out a way to cut that amount of interaction down, we just actually create those sequences that long and just reinforce it, right?

194
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,300
And that's brutal.

195
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:46,000
Because if you're on the other end of it, It, you know, you're opting for more of a, you know, quantity than a quality approach, right?

196
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:53,100
And so, you know, the goodness is, in the details doubles, not in the details, it's a goodness.

197
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
That's in the details right now, like that.

198
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:08,400
Well, you know, that just to give a shot out to get O'Brien of the team out there at Sand, do, so we use the heck out of, so do, so I don't care what our budget is forced to do.

199
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,900
So if we're booking Things like let us get that budget as big as possible.

200
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,400
So Brian and closing some deals here for you.

201
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,400
But like, that's the approach you want to take, right?

202
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,900
Is it's not about throwing out a, you know, Amazon gift card.

203
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,300
Right?

204
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,400
It's about, you know, maybe doing a, you know, Wellness kit.

205
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,500
Emily can talk a little bit about that or you see somebody that you know, has you know pets.

206
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,200
You know you're doing a kit for, you know for dogs.

207
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I got three of them.

208
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:47,200
So if I am getting a Centos will gift, you know, that's pet-related got one of those lazy dogs, right next?

209
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,000
To me, sleep in a way as I am on a webinar, right?

210
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,400
So you just got to get more relevant with what you're actually putting out there, right?

211
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,800
And not taking the, you know, oh, it's sticking to take 27 touches.

212
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,000
Okay, well that maybe you know what we're doing.

213
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,700
Now, how do we get that?

214
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,300
Like 12 or a Right?

215
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:26,500
So that we're providing a lot more relevancy to what they're going to digest versus that, you know, mentality of like, I am going to choke you with so much information until you know, scream uncle and okay.

216
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,200
Sure you're going to.

217
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,900
You're going to hear back from me, right?

218
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,700
But it's going to be a no, right?

219
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,100
Or it's going to be a knock-down.

220
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,100
So I know I went off there a little bit, but I am just passionate about this.

221
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:52,100
Yeah, it's Really, really important to me that our team is providing value to the folks on the other end and be mindful of when do we get those replies?

222
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:58,100
Are we getting them on step 3, or is it 9:00, you know, and how do we get better?

223
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,100
So I will shut up and pass the someone else greens.

224
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,400
I think you missed the fine print on that survey.

225
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,100
It said, if you're doing things, the way you were 10 years ago, it's going to take you 27.

226
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,500
Right?

227
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,300
We need to change the way you're doing your Outreach, and lean on the new things that are in Market to help you get there.

228
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,600
So do so obviously being one of them.

229
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,400
So, thank you for the shout out but there are things you can be doing differently.

230
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,100
It's the stale organizations that are still happy.

231
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,600
That's trouble.

232
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,400
That's kind of funny.

233
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,500
So I sent an email to a we're doing it.

234
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,100
We do events for internal and external use cases.

235
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
So, we're doing ahead of community of that.

236
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:44,900
We will often sell to VCS or heads of community at companies, and they do a bunch of events to activate their Community as commercial interest and so forth.

237
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,100
But we're doing this really curated event with Robert.

238
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,000
Who's the founder of daybreaker?

239
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,800
It's amazing Community.

240
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,900
She's also an entrepreneur.

241
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:02,300
She wrote a book called The Long, which is about community building, and then we invited the head of Immunity who hadn't responded to a few emails of mine in a bit for this BC.

242
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,000
And she immediately goes, oh my gosh, this looks amazing.

243
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,100
I actually can't make it.

244
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,700
But thank you so much for the invite.

245
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:14,100
I am going to invite this, you know, had a couple of my people from my firm join unless definitely catch up as soon as possible.

246
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:21,600
So it's kind of interesting because, of course, we have certain sequences, and we're figuring out who to Target, but that resonated, right?

247
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,000
And so, it resonated because we thought about the actual format of what that what we're asking.

248
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,400
Yeah.

249
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:34,200
Ask given a skit, hopefully that experience should be providing value to them the same way.

250
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,500
I mean, Junior putting this together.

251
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:41,100
Hopefully folks, on this, on this call can get some value, and it's not just a one-way value Street.

252
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,200
You're asking, and receiving as well, but So good.

253
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:53,100
So what are some strategies and tactics that we have a sense?

254
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,200
Clearly not working.

255
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:05,600
So that's the inundation all of us are experiencing right now with emails ads and it's not really resonating, you know, but what is working.

256
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,800
So what have you all been doing it?

257
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:13,500
Like, are there any strategies or creative ideas that you're currently implementing?

258
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,400
That's really working?

259
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Well, I can touch on the wellness kit that Danilo mentioned.

260
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:25,900
So basically all of our reps have this Wellness kit has like chicken noodle soup.

261
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:33,900
Like all things kind of comfort related in this Wellness kit and all of our reps have access to some this, to their customers and their prospects.

262
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:45,800
But we initially launched this, it was because we were getting a lot of feedback from Danilo and his team that they were seeing open rates were down, reply rates were down, and we really needed to find a way.

263
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,900
To re-engage this audience.

264
00:26:48,600 --> 00:27:01,000
So we pulled our Target account list of all the people that had been not responding to emails but had responded to us in the past and basically acknowledged that it was, it was early winter.

265
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,200
A lot of people were under the weather understanding that when they kind of come back, they're probably going to have a really increased workload.

266
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,500
So what can we do to help them on both friends there?

267
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,800
So, we sent them this Wellness kit to help them kind of recover as they come back into work.

268
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:22,500
And then we're also pairing that with something helpful to help them, you know, hit the ground running once they come back into the office.

269
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,800
So we paired it with our AVM play generator.

270
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,600
Hello and his team were going out to customize and Prospects that way.

271
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,100
But then on the marketing side we were providing air cover ads with very, very simple.

272
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,500
Add to this audience with no CTA.

273
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,400
It just had some text on it.

274
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,800
That said, check your email from us, this actually increased open rates about 20% across this email program.

275
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:53,000
And then, after once, once the people started redeeming, we started targeting them with those a VM play generator ads.

276
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:04,200
We were able to see about an 11% redeemed opportunity, right on this, just by getting sales to open the or just by getting this gift, kind of opened the door for sales to really build those relationships.

277
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,400
Right on.

278
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,600
Stephen were even jumping?

279
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,400
No, I was purely saying that.

280
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,100
I think I love that.

281
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,000
That's a great idea.

282
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,400
That was the extent of my reaction but I can say some other stuff if you'd like.

283
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,700
I mean if you have got anything else to contribute to what's working for you all.

284
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,100
Yeah, it's interesting.

285
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,100
I guess so, you know, on this subject of tools for us.

286
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,800
So we are doing a lot of testing on paid marketing and growth rate.

287
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:42,400
And what we have realized is from our experiences, the interesting thing for us is even though we're beat to be part of what we do.

288
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,700
Feels consumer II.

289
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,500
Yeah, consumer-friendly in nature.

290
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:52,900
It's B2B to see the ultimate consumer is the employee or the Community member from the experiences events kind of standpoint.

291
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:03,600
So, some folks actually don't necessarily from a product experience perspective, actually, just want to shop as they would normally, on a Marketplace, like Airbnb experiences or whatever it is.

292
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:09,500
And then we have higher complexity products whether it's like a venue by outdoor Retreat or some newer.

293
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,200
He's spending a lot of money and it's more.

294
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:17,800
Flex where you really want to talk to someone and then it's like, how do we actually structure our lead flow?

295
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,800
And we only have so many people right?

296
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,100
Steph.

297
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,600
So then with that multi kind of variable equation we're thinking about.

298
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,000
Okay.

299
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,300
How do we how does that inform product roadmap around?

300
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,400
What should be what ought to be self cert?

301
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:47,100
And I think this applies for mobile view be SAS as well, which is okay, you know, how really there should be damned for eternity to perhaps, you know, learn as much as you can and then at the right moment, bringing that human because you may not want to have a certain interaction and you may want to.

302
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,100
I can actually mutiny is an example where they have a really great product.

303
00:29:51,100 --> 00:30:02,500
LED growth component, where you can actually literally redesign your website with beauty and so you can see the value of it and that I am like, oh gosh, I really want to talk to someone over there.

304
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:11,200
And so it's this interesting Dynamic around human centricity, doesn't have to mean also to nil.

305
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:23,400
Point, you know, let us just talk to people as much as we can and now I heard this buzzword called human to human interaction and how we were going to throw all our humans out to interact with many people as possible.

306
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,500
I think if you hear some of these buzzwords that I think it's the same way of like growth hacking.

307
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:33,600
People are right about growth hacking, and then they're like okay cool, we're gonna like create all these tests we're going to get all these customers.

308
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,800
I think it's really taking that phrase in understanding how it ought to apply to your customer.

309
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:49,900
So in our case, it's kind of like okay well Who do we, who should we talk to both from, you know, ability to solve their problems and bandwidth of our team.

310
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,900
And that's how we're prioritizing kind of sales interactions.

311
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,000
It?

312
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:02,100
Ultimately, when we build more product is features for the high complexity stuff within our business, it will also still serve up human interaction in the right time.

313
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:09,600
So we think about it in the context of not only sales and marketing but also product and other kind of areas of our business.

314
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,800
But one other thing to touch on, just following up on what Emily said.

315
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:30,000
And as you can see, you know, just from the examples that Emily share, and we're very spoiled here, we have got an amazing marketing team and it's just amazing partnership, right?

316
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,800
So it just goes back to what I was saying.

317
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:38,900
I think when we first started about, you know, the cross-functional team work, right?

318
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,600
The overlap, right?

319
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,500
So you No Emily shared.

320
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:50,400
You know, an example or two, there are a couple things that stand out to me, you know, is you know, the high engagers, right?

321
00:31:50,400 --> 00:32:04,600
So if we have, you know, folks that are out there, you know, and you can tell this through Outreach or salesloft, or any of these platforms who's clicking on your links who's opening and multiple times, and so forth.

322
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:11,100
So, you know, that those folks are interested, but there's something that's preventing them from, you know, replying to you.

323
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:19,900
And Aim, you know whether it's hey, we're not quite ready this quarter, or we may be, you know, there's a budget constraint.

324
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:25,500
I mean, that's your the climate that we're in, you know, today, for example.

325
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:41,400
But you know, we do a really, really good job of marketing providing that are cover and jumping in with additional channels to really unstuck those folks, right?

326
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:52,000
And so we will try a few different messages and depending on which message, they resonate, we kind of shift our mindset here to address that pain point.

327
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,800
Right?

328
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:58,100
Because, you know, typically you have that messaging that's like industry-focused, right?

329
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:04,000
You have messaging, that's, you know, related to a particular product or so forth, right?

330
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:10,800
But that's just doesn't cut it these days anymore, you got to go the Step Beyond and understand.

331
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,400
Okay.

332
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,700
Well, maybe it's dependent on the tech that they use, right?

333
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,800
Could that be a trigger for what you know, messaging we want to use, right?

334
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,600
So we have an amazing integration with HubSpot, for example, right?

335
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,000
That you know, we want to know if that's a driver, right?

336
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So our marketing team does incredible job, you know, providing that are cover and putting those messages in and depending on what they're actually clicking on.

337
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,800
You know, we're able to actually then get even a lot more.

338
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,100
Or you know what the messaging Emily.

339
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:57,100
I don't know if you want to jump in with an additional comment on that, but I think you all do an amazing job when it comes to that type of stuff to harm us with, you know, necessary tools from a messaging perspective.

340
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,100
Thanks, Noah.

341
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,900
Well, I grew I can definitely touch on that.

342
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,200
I definitely think that we use our marketing automation platform.

343
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:20,500
So much to kind of identify when these customers are responding to campaigns that are relevant to you know, certain topics certain Integrations, and then we also track who's visiting those pages, and we have trigger set up.

344
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:35,400
So if somebody lands on a page that talks about are how spotted integration they're immediately going to be getting an email, it's usually going to From that assigned sales rep, just kind of continue building that relationship and make it feel like it's a human talking to another human.

345
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,900
Just going to be giving them more information.

346
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:52,199
It's very like light message just acknowledging that they have been looking at some of this content across the web and what can we do to help their experience be a little bit better and what can we do to help them?

347
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,400
So rich, these are, these are like some amazing key insights and tips.

348
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,700
Brian, where you go to say something?

349
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:02,600
Yeah.

350
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:29,000
Just going to add some of the a really focused on internally is to make sure we're focused on the full customer journey and where, as Danilo said, not just sending stuff to send stuff, I think the only other good thing about having a sending strategy within your Outreach programs is if I is to send, you know, a few ten emails to Danilo, and he wasn't getting back to me.

351
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,800
But then I sent him a bone for his dog.

352
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,700
We might be like, well for one second, that's creepy, but then he's like my dog.

353
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:44,100
So I think the one place where you can get beyond the creepy is by sending someone a gift if it's going to work.

354
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:50,000
And if this personalized and it's something that they can use, then all the creepiness goes away.

355
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,400
So using the data to learn about people, and then using that as a benefit to you, We will break through the Clutter.

356
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:09,200
Yeah, I think is, is again why we built what we built its and do so, but the externally, you know, you want to make sure that you're getting into our clients workflows.

357
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:25,100
So, to Emily's point the usage of or Danilo uses of HubSpot and all these other Technologies, we want to make sure that the doses available to you in those platforms so that as a client, you're able to streamline her entire process without having to go into multiple that forms.

358
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,900
So I think that's a really big way we personalize for our clients.

359
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,100
That's great.

360
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,500
Yeah, that's a really good point that Brian just brought up, right?

361
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:50,600
Because, you know, the more you need to go into, you know, different areas, you know, to find information, you know, human nature, right?

362
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,800
The less you're going to do it.

363
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,100
Hey, you know, let us be honest, right?

364
00:36:54,100 --> 00:37:05,700
We can preach, you know, about it, and we will get a lot of head nods but you know, you have to have a platform that's going to be, you know, Little more inclusive, right?

365
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,800
That's going to be in the tools that you're currently, you know, your sales team in your SD, our team live it, right?

366
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:20,400
So whether its sales force was, its HubSpot or, you know, one of the other, you know, crms out there and, you know, that's, that's what we do here.

367
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:27,400
You know, a troll works as well as you know if you think about sales, you think about, you know, the Str realm.

368
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,000
You want to be multi-threaded, right?

369
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:40,500
What you don't want is You know, going after something that is very, very specific to that one particular person.

370
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:40,800
Sure.

371
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,500
You can personalize it, based on, you know, send me a bone Brian any time for my dogs, by the way.

372
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:52,000
But you don't want to just rely on that piece of information, right?

373
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:59,300
There's buying committees that these days are, you know if you're looking at strategic accounts, right?

374
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:09,800
I mean could be 1520 people even with smaller organizations when You know, all our sales team pulls me in on calls to say, hey, how does Roller Shoes roll works?

375
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,800
You know, there's two to three people on those calls, right at the very minimum, right?

376
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,500
And that's just, you know, people that are into buying committee that are on the sales side, right?

377
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:25,700
So, you want to make sure that as you're personalizing, this approach, you don't lose sight of that, right?

378
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,400
It's not just about that individual.

379
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:33,900
It's about, you know how that individual, you know, is basically.

380
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,100
We interact with other people within that organization.

381
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,900
So if you can see those data points, bring that into the conversation, right?

382
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:50,500
Because they have got folks that they're working with internally, just like I work very, very closely with Emily and the rest of the marketing team.

383
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,800
I think one app one interesting point is to throw back, but how to win, friends and influence people?

384
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,300
I see a lot of folks have read the book, and I was just pulling it up to.

385
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,900
There're six ways to make people, like you or become genuinely interested.

386
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,800
In other people.

387
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,500
Another really interesting is remembered the person's name.

388
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Be a good listener.

389
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,500
Talk in terms of other people's interest and make the other person feel important sincerely.

390
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,900
So you think about those lessons?

391
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:25,800
Those are few that have always people always known What is the anecdote that Carnegie would write people's Nate?

392
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,700
They have got on a note card and practice, you know what they're interested in now?

393
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,000
We have all these tools, right?

394
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:44,400
So we have C, we have sophisticated crms, we have multiple systems that can tell you, when you should say all that stuff with technology, whether it's in whatever Channel, it is, right, whether it's email or SMS, or whatever, whatever channel.

395
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:50,400
So I think taking those lessons and then taking, you know, with a beginner's mind set around.

396
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,000
Okay, now I have all this technology.

397
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,400
How do I do that?

398
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,400
And then do it authentically because if you just take it and then you're like, cool.

399
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,800
Now, I am going to send everyone dog bones and like Willie, that's right, not going to work, right?

400
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:09,300
But if you do it the right way, then with Brian and Danielle of might work, but Love that book.

401
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,500
If you got the lake, feel free to drop it in chat for us.

402
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,000
Human.

403
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,800
I have I just put up the best summary of How to Win Friends and Influence People to well, alright, whatever you got, I think this is irrelevant.

404
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:31,400
So, talking about high intent and really being able to identify that across a buyer Journey.

405
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,300
Some of you have mentioned using your current CRM tools.

406
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,200
Like what are you guys using like, a sixth sense?

407
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,300
What tools are you using to track that?

408
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:46,900
And how are you continuing to keep tabs and alignment with your marketing and sales teams?

409
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:55,200
We're using our own tool roll Works to do a lot of this from a marketing perspective.

410
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,100
We're able to create Dynamic campaigns.

411
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:08,300
Based that change the messaging based on what Journey stage or what buying stage somebody might be in and then that information is also being transferred over to our CRM.

412
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:17,900
So our sales reps are also able to see the same thing and use that to really prioritize which accounts to reach out to First and what kinds of messages might resonate with those customers or prospects.

413
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,700
Yeah, just to follow up on what Emily said, right?

414
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:37,000
You know what's great about having a, you know, comprehensive ABM platform is that, you know, it can you know, really coordinate help coordinate those efforts right?

415
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,900
So what you know Emily was talking about in terms of Journey stages right?

416
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:52,400
What them you know for us means is you know think of as an accounts for right like an account stage score You know, whatever term you want to use.

417
00:41:52,800 --> 00:42:12,200
So, you know, it helps us, you know, from a perspective of, you know, those additional signals, you know, understand you know, for example whether it's Marketo that you're using as a marketing automation platform or whether it's HubSpot, we want to understand those signals, right?

418
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,900
We want to understand, you know what links they're clicking on, right?

419
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:23,000
And we want to take, you know, T dat up and our product is called sales insights to the Str team.

420
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:32,400
So that way, as they're really reaching out and trying to personalize that message, you know, we do have that human a human, you know, connection, right?

421
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,800
So if I am reaching out, for example to Emily, I can say, hey, I notice your colleague.

422
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,600
Yeah.

423
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,900
You know, Susan or Bill, we're on the website.

424
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,900
There were checking out these pieces of content and so forth.

425
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,700
So it's a lot more relative you know, interaction.

426
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:53,900
Much more personalized that Of all the people at the organization and the buying committee, right?

427
00:42:53,900 --> 00:43:03,800
And tees it up for, you know, our sales development rep to have all those, you know, right there in the tool at their fingertips.

428
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,000
So that way we can, we can reference it right?

429
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,200
Because that's a piece of that personalization, right?

430
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,600
That we don't talk about.

431
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,400
It's like, the person that's kind of raising.

432
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:27,900
Their hand may not be the right person to reach out to, but you can certainly use their interaction with your Brand and your organization to actually make it a much more human conversation with the person that is relevant.

433
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:44,300
And that's become even more important today because of the economy that we're in, because of the layoffs that were going through, you know, marketing as a general profession is a rapid, you know as a revolving door.

434
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:54,500
So if you're only the multi-threading I think the no you said before has become even more important and there's there has to be a focus on that through these organizations.

435
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,700
Because number one, you might be talking to the wrong person, it doesn't have a decision ability.

436
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,800
Number two, that person your Champion might not be there tomorrow and then, what do you do?

437
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,100
Key point it's real.

438
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,300
All right.

439
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,600
Well we're going to have a magic show soon.

440
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:25,400
So just to wrap this time up, could each of you share any point of encouragement or advice or tip for the B2B go-to-market Community?

441
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,600
Brian, you just touched it.

442
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,500
It's a hard time right now, we're seeing on LinkedIn.

443
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,100
It's like a doom.

444
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:40,700
Scroll of just some of our friends in Tech, getting let go left and right at the same time we're seeing a lot of hiring opportunities also open up.

445
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:45,500
So it's a really up and down kind of experience.

446
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,400
What advice would you give to our community in just had to show up?

447
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,500
And any other pots.

448
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,400
This is there's a very open for you.

449
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,300
I could be a tactical point of advice as well.

450
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:08,100
Well, I will start as been mentioned but find the problem that you can solve and help the person solve it and then the biggest thing is don't waste anyone's time.

451
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,500
No one has a lot of time anymore to waste or to be wasted.

452
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:22,000
So if you come with a Subjective in a bowl that you can help them solve as a problem they're facing and their daily work life.

453
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,300
They're going to be more active listening into it.

454
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:32,500
So I think that's really important, especially in the first conversation Yeah, I would touch on that.

455
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,300
I just to give a shot out to, you know, our VP of sales here.

456
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:42,200
Sean you know, he's got an approach of like Choose Your Own Adventure, right?

457
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:51,600
So a lot of times, you know, you go into, you know, these sales Cycles would organizations right?

458
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,100
Yeah.

459
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:58,000
And you know it's helpful to just you know as Brian mentioned don't waste people's time, right?

460
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,400
Help them understand what.

461
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,600
It's the best course of action.

462
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:19,200
You know for them in terms of like an evaluation process right help guide them along the way and you know, we have got, you know, for different, you know, choose your adventures, you know, kind of, you know, sales cycle that we have walk people through, and we guide them, right?

463
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:27,800
So it's, you know, you hear a lot about, you know, solution selling walking people through it, but rarely do people live that right?

464
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,600
And really, you know, It's something like that.

465
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:40,200
So that's probably my advice is just, you know, give the folks out there a little more guidance in terms of, you know, how to go about it.

466
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,000
Right?

467
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:59,000
There's a lot of products out there a lot of confusing, you know, sometimes, you know, everybody sounds the same so help people walk through it and you know what they should look for, they should evaluate it and just be very genuine about it.

468
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:07,600
Thinking about what Brian and Danielle said to, I think, from a marketing perspective.

469
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:17,100
Like once, you have that account list really, really, well, defined what I often do when I am creating new campaigns, is just reading it over again and asking myself.

470
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:25,600
Like, is this actually helping the customer Prospect do their job and meet their personal and professional goals.

471
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,200
So we get oftentimes really wrapped up in our day-to-day work.

472
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,000
We sometimes forget, we're talking to another human.

473
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:39,700
On the other the side of the screen even if you're serving ads to an entire buying committee, there's only one person on the other side of the screen that's going to be looking at that ad.

474
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:52,500
So throughout the jargon really tighten up, your messaging focus on individuals, pain points and how your business can really help them achieve their professional and personal goals and hopefully close their laptop.

475
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,600
At the end of the day, just feeling a little bit less stress off their shoulders.

476
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,100
I would say so I live in New York.

477
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:15,800
One positive thing that happened recently was I didn't run the marathon, but I went to Central Park and solve like we're running a marathon, and they're just people just on the side just like cheering and Hi-Fi vegan and, you know, cheering honored strangers.

478
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,400
And, so I thought that was kind of uplifting because I was like, alright, Humanity, still not so bad.

479
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:27,300
You got hundreds of thousands of people out here just like happy to be kind of physically able to go on a run.

480
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:42,600
So I was like, That's doesn't have anything to be marketing but I think that was encouraging for me to see that and then also just you know marketing and sales you're talking to folks on the other side it's important for me is someone who's working with a great team at Marco.

481
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:55,600
To also remember to treat and get better and better at treating folks within our company as humans because I think you just mentioned like multi-threading and how are we all going to speak to the prospect in this in the certain way?

482
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,800
And I think it's important to speak to each other.

483
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,800
You have people that you work with super frequently in that way.

484
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,100
So then they can take that ethos and bring it forward to the End customer.

485
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:15,000
So it might be, it might be kind of rocky time in the economy but I think everything is cyclical and ways that I think just also remember that.

486
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,200
So, Right on.

487
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,100
Thank you all for sharing those insights.

488
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,100
My heart already.

489
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,600
Feels lifted from that.

490
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,800
Alright, so again, thank you to all our panelists.

491
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:34,700
We're going to transition now Suman, I am going to hand it over to you, because we have got a pretty exciting magic show with Kevin Blake.

492
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,500
So, hey everyone.

493
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,800
Let us see, do we?

494
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:49,700
I will tell him I will do a little kind of intro injury here because we have known each other for a while and it will cut to video.

495
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:59,300
So I said a little bit about Marco what we do is we help companies build culture through events that started off with like six hosts on a PDF, Kevin Blake was one of them.

496
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:09,000
And so he's been a great part of our journey, on the subject of kind of humanizing experiences, super talented, but really has this amazing ability to connect.

497
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,700
People through stories and 4-bit, suspend reality with magic.

498
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,900
So he's going to share a bit of that with us today.

499
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,500
Just a bit about his background.

500
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,200
Yeah, there we go.

501
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,500
There's Kevin, he is an Illusionist that Palace Theater.

502
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:33,900
He has performed in front of crowds from companies, as big as kind of Google and is Amazon, as small as Marco, and his done tons of shows with us virtually.

503
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:39,000
And in person throughout the pandemic and excited to call him a friend, as they one thing to Kevin.

504
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:45,300
Is he wrote hand wrote three people on our team, a letter once to Express gratitude for our partnership?

505
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,200
And so that I will always have had the thing is, Kevin has lost his voice.

506
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:56,200
So on the subject of being a human, Kevin is a wizard but also a human as well.

507
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:02,500
So he's been kind enough to join us still and figure out how to do some somewhat of a silent show here.

508
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:07,800
And, so I just wanted to come on really quickly and brag about Kevin and do it a bit.

509
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,800
A bit of an intro.

510
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:39,400
And so with that, I will pass it over to Kevin and Gina, perhaps we can bring someone from the, from the stage or I will I am so sorry.

511
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:10,100
Prophecy about deal.

512
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,800
All right, I got it.

513
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,700
Santa Claus.

514
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,000
I am curious.

515
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,000

Wow, that was amazing.

527
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,600
I was not expecting that to happen.

528
