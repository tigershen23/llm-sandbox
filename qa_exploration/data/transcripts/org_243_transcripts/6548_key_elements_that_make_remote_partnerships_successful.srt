1
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:20,200
Hello everyone, I am Gina, and I am so stoked to be here with you all tuning in from Ewa Beach.

2
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,700
White, which is on Oahu about 30 minutes from Honolulu.

3
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,300
If you all know and are familiar today, we have a really special guest.

4
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,700
Her name is Mateo, and she is the partner manager at tight form.

5
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,600
So we're going to dive into her story.

6
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,500
But before we go into that, let you see.

7
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,300
Is tuning in.

8
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,100
We have got Laura from Texas, Janet Mendocino.

9
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,300
Hello.

10
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,200
Ivan from Jersey City.

11
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,600
So glad that you're here, feel free to drop.

12
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,100
What city you're tuning in from and chat?

13
00:02:52,200 --> 00:03:08,200
There's also a Q&A tab, so as you're going through and listening to Mathias story, and if you got questions for her, feel free to drop them in the Q&A, and we will be sure to pull those on stage as we're getting to know, Mattea.

14
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,700
So with that, I would love to introduce Matea to the stage for free to join me up here.

15
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,400
Hello.

16
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,400
Hey Tina, how are you?

17
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,400
I am doing great.

18
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,300
Thanks for having me.

19
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,200
Good, good.

20
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,100
And you're tuning in from where today?

21
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,400
I am from Seattle awesome.

22
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:43,800
And what's the weather like It's sunny, but deceivingly cold, and it's about 40 degrees, so Seattle will get you that way.

23
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,600
Yeah, absolutely.

24
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,100
But we will take it over the rain.

25
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,300
Okay, nice.

26
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,900
Nice, great.

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,600
Well, before we kick off into this really great breakdown of your story that we have got here outlined.

28
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,400
We wanted to play a quick little game to get to know you a little bit.

29
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,800
It's called two truths and a lie.

30
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,000
And basically, there are going to be three facts.

31
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,900
So let us go ahead and get that on stage.

32
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a quick poll, okay?

33
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,800
So of these two of them are the truth and one will be a lie.

34
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:30,200
So Mattea could you break down these troops and what of one of these?

35
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,700
It's a lie and folks, feel free to vote wherever you think the LIE is.

36
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,300
So what are these fun facts about?

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,600
My brothers, are the fifth generation of twins in my family.

38
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,600
I was a D1 athlete and my favorite food is hamburgers.

39
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,500
All right, go ahead and drop your votes.

40
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,700
Like D1 athlete?

41
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,400
Hmm.

42
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,300
And twit fifth generation of twins.

43
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,300
That's like, I don't know.

44
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,300
Hamburgers.

45
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,300
I love hamburgers.

46
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,700
Hmm.

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,800
All right.

48
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,900
Okay, so votes are in All right, Mattea, reveal of these?

49
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,000
Which one is the LIE?

50
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,600
My favorite food is not hamburgers.

51
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,300
I have been a vegetarian my entire life, so definitely out of the question.

52
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,900
But someone put in the chat and no cheese, I love cheese, so I am not vegan, but yeah, I was a D1 athlete.

53
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:45,300
I played tennis University of Dayton and my brothers are the fifth generation of twins in my family.

54
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,600
It actually didn't skip a generation either, so pretty crazy.

55
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,700
Wow, that is crazy.

56
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,100
And how long do you were a D1 athlete?

57
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,000
We're at again.

58
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
University of Dayton in Ohio.

59
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,600
Wow.

60
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,900
Very cool.

61
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Tennis head-to-head.

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:14,400
I don't think got, I think, you'd totally slam me in that and I would not want to make very cool.

63
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:22,600
Well Mattea, tell us a little bit about your journey getting into partner management.

64
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,200
And, you know, I would love to hear a little bit of your story getting into Tech as well.

65
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,600
Well.

66
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,700
Yeah, definitely.

67
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:40,900
So I majored in entrepreneurship and Supply Chain management when I was at Dayton and then I went directly into a sales role.

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,400
After college, my dad has been in sales pretty much his entire career.

69
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:56,100
So, followed in his footsteps and I worked at AWS started in their sales internship program and then into a full-time role.

70
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:28,900
So, had a couple years there where I was helping on the inbound sales team and then on the outbound sales team and then I transitioned into an account manager role, Amazon's on the other side, not on the cloud services anymore, where I was working with our vendors in Latin America for Amazon Explorer, which is a virtual travel experience, and it happened to launch kind of right around covid, even though it wasn't really a covid play.

71
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,300
Say, and so I was in that role for a bit working with folks in Latin America that were providing those travel experiences which is wow.

72
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,400
Okay, so describe that a little bit.

73
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,900
Because we're yeah, we're in the events world as well.

74
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:55,300
So you all were providing virtual experiences like what kind of experiences Yeah, so, in Buried.

75
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:04,000
So you can have a shopping experience if you wanted to go to local shops in Argentina, and they would send you a pair of earrings.

76
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You could have that or you could have one of my vendors in.

77
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:20,600
My favorite experience was visiting a rescue ranch in Costa Rica where you got to see like toucans loss of all these animals up close.

78
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,500
So I was yeah, it was pretty cool.

79
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,000
Well, unfortunately, they're they have shut down.

80
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,200
I think a couple weeks ago but yeah, the time being it was yeah various thought.

81
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,500
They tried something out.

82
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,100
Yeah.

83
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,900
And you said yeah, an experience to we did after.

84
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:54,800
So after you mention that Katie and I were just like, so curious about this, we went on AWS, we're like whoa, they actually do offer these virtual experiences there was like a tour in Israel and a Sorry and all these things.

85
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:03,200
So we signed up for one just to try it out and it was an amazing, just whole rundown with this with the Safari.

86
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Dude, that walked us through different animals that he brought up to the camera.

87
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,500
There were like these exotic animals, it was really fun.

88
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:20,100
So very cool experiment by AWS and you know, unfortunate that it had to get shut down.

89
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:30,900
But so you were reading that and were you managing and identifying and getting all of the different vendors and partners that would be part of this program.

90
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,600
Yeah, so it was an interesting time because it happened all around covid.

91
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:45,400
A lot of travel companies were starting to go out of business or looking for ways to make up that Revenue that they weren't getting within person travel.

92
00:09:45,400 --> 00:10:06,100
And so it was a very, I would say easy way for us to get involved with them in the beginning, because they wanted to diversify how they were making revenue and oh, well, we can off, we can solve our tour guides, you can pay them, they can offer these experiences like they would Good in person and have them on Amazon.

93
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,000
So, Gotcha.

94
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,600
Wow.

95
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,100
So interesting was that hard to identify them or like, how would you go about demon find?

96
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,400
Yeah, somebody that gives you a tour and Israel, or how do you find?

97
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,700
Yeah.

98
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:30,600
Most of them were major tour companies and then a lot of them have individual hosts, that do the experience.

99
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,800
And so we started with a bigger ones, and then scaled down to smaller tour companies as well.

100
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,900
Because some were just not built for the virtual experience environment.

101
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:52,600
Like getting them, they had to get a phone, download our app and go through training with our team and everything and it was somewhere just not built for that.

102
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,400
So It was a Rancher.

103
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,900
All right.

104
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,300
Okay.

105
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:04,800
So then fast-forward you're working with AWS managing these incredible epic experiences and then.

106
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,300
And then what Yeah, and then I joined type Forum, which is where I am now as a partner manager.

107
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:22,200
And I kind of wanted to switch out of a sales role and go more into business development Partnerships because I think that's kind of the way of the future of selling.

108
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:36,400
And luckily I have had a really good team of mentors to coach me through the process of Partnerships and kind of get me up to speed because I was coming from a sales back.

109
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,800
Round, but a lot of (Mike) my skills were really transferable, I think.

110
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,800
How long have you been with typeform?

111
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,300
In this.

112
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,500
Just over a year now.

113
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,100
Yeah, yes.

114
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,500
Okay, so break it down a little bit because Partnerships, you know, there're Partnerships and marketing, there're Partnerships and product.

115
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
There's so many different types of Partnerships.

116
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,200
How do you define it with the role that you're in at tight form?

117
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,200
Yeah, that's a good question.

118
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,900
I think Partnerships could sit under sales.

119
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,600
They can send or Business Development.

120
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,800
They can sit under product depending on the type of partnership.

121
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,100
We're under business development, but we work with all of those cross-functional teams.

122
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,300
So we have, I would say two major types of Partnerships out type form.

123
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,700
We have our Tech integration Partners.

124
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:33,300
So, for example, HubSpot you can build a type form and then push your responses in top spot.

125
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,400
Or we have our referral Partners.

126
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,300
So marketing agencies that we work with that refer typeform to their clients.

127
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,900
Those are our two main partner types.

128
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,600
We have you know affiliate style like a few others.

129
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,700
But those are our main focus.

130
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,100
Gotcha.

131
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,600
Okay.

132
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,900
And then, where is your main focus?

133
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
It's a great, it's a great question.

134
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:06,200
I would say, mainly on our marketing agency referral Partners, it's who I work most closely with gotcha.

135
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,500
Okay, so can you walk us through what, what's a day in the life?

136
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,000
Like are you identifying agencies talking to them?

137
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,500
And then ultimately what does a win-win look like?

138
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:30,300
Yeah, definitely, so most of our partners right now come in organically, they love type warm, and they want to be a partner.

139
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:42,900
So they apply on our landing page, we get them review the application, put them into our partner relationship management tool which is partner stack, and then we will work with them and have like an onboarding call work.

140
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,800
With them to get up to speed and different enablement material certified.

141
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,900
And then from there, that's when they're referring clients.

142
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,700
It's to type form, and then we're sharing leads to them because they will go up on our directory.

143
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:08,500
And so for example, if someone needs help with their typeform, they can go on our directory and find a certified partner to work with and get that started on their own.

144
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,100
Gotcha.

145
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:18,300
So, when, when you're trying to get a win-win going, what does, what does that look like for you?

146
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,400
And also for the partner?

147
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:35,900
Yeah, definitely I think the most important thing about Partnerships and if you don't take anything else away from this entire conversation is that it has to be mutually beneficial and it has to be a win-win for both us and for the partner, otherwise, it's not going to be successful.

148
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:44,400
And so, you know, kind of what we look for in a good partner is having a shared ideal customer profile or ICP.

149
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:53,300
If we don't have that it's not going to be successful and then also an overlap in our Text, a core ecosystem is also really helpful.

150
00:14:53,300 --> 00:15:10,700
So if we have an agency, that is also certified in HubSpot, for example, and type form, then were continually growing that customer base, and it's kind of win-win for all types of Partners and that's the ideal situation.

151
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,400
Gotcha.

152
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,000
Okay, that, that's interesting.

153
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:29,800
And at a given time, are you meeting to manage like X number of relationships, you know, and how do you do that well, especially remotely and, or do you go in person and meet with some of these Partners sometimes?

154
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,900
Or, I mean, how, how do you all keep the relationship?

155
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,900
Good.

156
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Yeah, I think it's a tricky question and something that everyone's figuring out in the remote environment.

157
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,200
I have actually been I think over 90% of my time.

158
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,800
Working has been remote and building relationships.

159
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,500
Pretty much through a little square on the screen.

160
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:05,900
So I think the biggest thing for us is Obviously developing a personal relationship and figuring out little things that you can take away from a call with someone really listening.

161
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:17,500
You know maybe it's something personal to not related to the deal or what you're working on but you can pull that into the next conversation and just show that you're a human being and you care about them.

162
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:41,500
But also automating our program where possible and so obviously, for getting a lot of inbound interest into our program, we still want our partners to feel You know, like they have this personal connection, but we can use tools like type form where it feels like a more genuine connection and video, ask is our other tool and so, it's a synchronous video.

163
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,100
And we have right now.

164
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,900
We have a welcome video to all of our partners and it's basically me on the screen, so they don't just get an email.

165
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,800
Hey, what's up?

166
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,200
They get me on the screen and it's talking them through the program, what to expect and it's just definitely a more personal way to do it.

167
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:10,000
And so, if you can find But always to do that for Automation and it helps you scale the program because obviously, we can't have a one-to-one relationship with every single partner that we have.

168
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,300
There're certain ones that will get that, and then certain ones, that it will be more automated that makes sense.

169
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:18,900
Wow, that's interesting.

170
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:36,200
So you have got this process dialed in, and we touched that a little bit about your process in starting the Bishop all the way through to nurturing it and then continuing to maintain the win-wins and the checkpoints along the way to know.

171
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,700
Okay, this is a good partner to keep, or this is probably a partner that we should probably part ways with.

172
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,800
So, could you just walk through that process?

173
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:55,300
Like, you know, once the request comes through, then you started to touch like the video intro do, does everybody get that?

174
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,400
Like, just walk us through that, that experience.

175
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,500
Yeah, so first is figuring out.

176
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Is this going to be a beneficial relationship for both parties because you can have a pretty simple process there?

177
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,700
If it's not just walk away, no hard feelings.

178
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,800
But if it is then we would kind of go through.

179
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,200
They would join our program, they get the video, Welcome, everyone does get that.

180
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:29,400
And then we have time set with me and my colleagues so that they can put a face to the name of who's messaging them when I have questions.

181
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,700
And stuff like that.

182
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:42,500
But I would say as far as the process goes for ass off identifying if it's a win-win second is building off of our current ecosystem, kind of smarter not harder approach.

183
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:57,300
So you know, we have our Tech partners, and we want to make sure that we're utilizing them and creating a better relationship and that's how we get a lot of our agencies and then Third.

184
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:05,300
It would be building the personal relationship where we can identify which partner is really fit under our ideal partner profile.

185
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:16,700
Because there are some that we get that apply that might not be exactly what we think is going to be the best, but they will still get in our program, they will get all the resources and information that they need.

186
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,700
And then the ones that we think will be really successful will develop that personal relationship with kind of that give to get mentality.

187
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:36,900
And then really creating an open line of communication, so making sure that they get product updates, and they are in the know of what's going on.

188
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,500
And they feel like they're really an extension of our team, pretty much as how we want them to feel.

189
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,100
And then I would say the last piece of that is continuously asking for feedback.

190
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:54,200
So we can improve the program and implementing changes where Hospital.

191
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,200
Gotcha, thank you so much for breaking that down, A-Z, that could be your white paper.

192
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,000
You just turn on Partner management.

193
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,400
This from Matea Matias, key Magical elements that make partnership successful remotely.

194
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,100
Yeah, so that's interesting.

195
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:26,100
Now, as far as the agencies that come through, are they already customers a type form or are they folks are just interested in Snoring?

196
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,300
It's a mixed bag.

197
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:37,300
I would say, probably 60% of them actually, probably 80% of them, at least have a free plan with us.

198
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,900
So they were familiar with type form.

199
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,200
And that's how they found us.

200
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:46,000
They love the product, and they really want to be a partner, which is awesome for us.

201
00:20:46,000 --> 00:21:03,100
And it's a really easy way to start that relationship when you don't have to explain you know the solution that your product solves But then the ones that don't, they're usually from us reaching out, so they might have hurt.

202
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,000
Usually they have heard of type form, but they might not use the tool yet.

203
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,800
Gotcha.

204
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,500
Okay.

205
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,100
So do you guys take both?

206
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:24,600
Like almost like an AVM approach in identifying, certain accounts that you want to partner with along with, you have got sort of that product lead, growth motion of folks, just coming.

207
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,500
To you asking to be partners.

208
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,000
So is it a mix of both?

209
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:36,700
Yeah, I would say for a long time, it's just been in Bound which has been a great way to grow the program.

210
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,000
Just because we have that organic interest, and we have a pretty small and mighty team over here.

211
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,900
So it's nice to have, you know, that organic growth coming in.

212
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:55,100
But now we're starting to be a little bit more strategic on the types of partners that we want to add as well as what's organically coming in.

213
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,500
And for typeform, like what would that?

214
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,500
What's your ideal partner?

215
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:18,500
Yeah, so for our referral partner, it's pretty much a digital marketing agency or digital experience agency and a lot of times they already use our ecosystem Partners.

216
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:25,700
So HubSpot slack MailChimp, they are very well versed in that Tech stack.

217
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,700
And yeah, I would say mostly that inbound marketing.

218
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,500
They do branding design.

219
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
Web design.

220
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,100
That's pretty much our ideal partner profile.

221
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,000
And they're mostly agencies.

222
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,300
They're not necessarily.

223
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,400
Yeah, they're always okay, gotcha, very interesting.

224
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,800
Wow.

225
00:22:49,800 --> 00:23:03,900
Okay so quick question here on like key outcomes of success so when you're looking your in a journey with the partner and you're like oh this is like exactly what we want to see happen.

226
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,000
What does that look like for you all?

227
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:37,200
Yeah, I think the key the major key outcome is sustainable growth for us and for them like if they're growing their client base because now they offer type form or refer type form to their clients and their certified in it, and they know how to use it, and they know the ins and outs, and they can be a champion for us and that grows their client base while also growing our client base, because we're getting more lie.

228
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,800
Needs more clients that are interested in type form because they work with that agency.

229
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:51,800
And also they are getting more leads from us to by being honored being on our directory being a certified partner.

230
00:23:51,900 --> 00:24:02,200
I think it's comes back to the win-win, and we look for just that sustainable growth instead of just oh, they referred one big client, which is great.

231
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:08,600
But we want to see like, repeatable, motions, and beautiful clients.

232
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,700
That's good.

233
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,600
And you mentioned earlier an ecosystem.

234
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,300
Partners.

235
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,400
And you were saying, like, MailChimp and HubSpot.

236
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:22,200
All these others is that a different type of partnership, relationship versus the agency relationships that you have like, went what is it?

237
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,900
How do you define your ecosystem partners?

238
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:33,300
Yeah, I think ecosystem is kind of buzz word thrown around in insides for now.

239
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:38,700
But basically, our ecosystem, I think it includes are all of our partner type.

240
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:44,800
So if you think of it like a circle type forms in the middle, for our Circle, not for everyone else's.

241
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,500
But we have, you know, HubSpot MailChimp on there, and then we have our marketing agencies on there.

242
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,800
We have our Affiliates on there, so that's that kind of encompasses the entire ecosystem.

243
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:02,900
And then when I think of our Tech stack or figure Partners like that, HubSpot MailChimp, etc.

244
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,500
Those are our integration Partners.

245
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:16,800
So the partnership is much different because they're not exact, it's more about because we integrate with HubSpot.

246
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:25,300
A lot of their clients want to use type form or vice versa because they're using type form, and they see, oh, I can actually add this into my CRM.

247
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,200
That's awesome.

248
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,900
And so it kind of goes both ways like that.

249
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:37,200
Instead of a direct referral model, it's more of like an influence model that makes sense.

250
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,500
Gotcha.

251
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,800
Yeah, that makes sense.

252
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,500
Wow, that's interesting.

253
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:50,000
So your team needs to strategically be aligned on all the different types of partners that you all are managing.

254
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,500
What is that even look like for your team's alignment?

255
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,900
You know you got different folks that are managing different types of Partnerships.

256
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,000
Do you guys all aligned on goals together and meet on a weekly stand up?

257
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,600
Like how does that work remotely?

258
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,200
Yeah definitely.

259
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:15,200
I would say We're really lucky because we're all on the same team even though we manage different types of Partnerships.

260
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,400
So we work really closely together and there's, we're a pretty lean team.

261
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:30,500
So we're in touch at least obviously once a week when we go over when or what everyone's working on and what people should know about.

262
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:42,400
But we're also trying to go forward work a lot more closely together because for example, if we have a new product features, Launch with one of those Tech Partners.

263
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:49,100
How do we get an agency involved as maybe as a spotlight story, for example?

264
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:58,000
And so there's a lot more that can be done with using the different partner types and making a bigger Splash per se on that.

265
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,400
Very nice.

266
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,300
Alright, if anybody has questions for Mattea, feel free to drop them in Q&A.

267
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:28,500
Otherwise, you know, I think for those that are interested in getting into partnership like how where do you start I think that you can come from a lot of different backgrounds because the skill set is transferable.

268
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:53,700
Obviously sales is a pretty natural fit, but say if you worked in product before you'd be a great fit for our product level Partnerships because a lot more of that is more technical base or if you're like a customer success manager, for example, you could switch into Partnerships because you're working with a customer To deliver on an outcome together.

269
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,800
And that's really similar to partnership.

270
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,900
So I don't think it's, I think it's similar, but different.

271
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,900
And if you can apply your skills, I mean, we're all of us are learning every day.

272
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:10,000
And, so I have been lucky to learn from my co-workers a lot that have had more experience in Partnerships.

273
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:18,700
But if you can just bring your transferable skills and interpersonal skills, I think a lot of different people could go into Partnerships.

274
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,700
That's great.

275
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:31,600
Yeah, so basically like if you're if you have got a background in, go to market or even in product management, it could be a really good get path.

276
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:41,100
If you're interested in getting into Partnerships, all right, we have a question that is popped on what was your best partnership and why?

277
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,200
That's a good question.

278
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,700
I would say.

279
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:59,200
I don't want to say exactly who are what it is, because I don't want other ones of our partners to be sad or offended.

280
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:20,600
But I would say, the reason why it's great, and one of our best is because there's an open line of communication and the relationship, I mean Partnerships take time and so developing that if you have an open line of communication and you're sharing, when's, you're sharing things that are working things that aren't working.

281
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,600
Being and you're constantly changing and developing off of that.

282
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,800
There's a lot of partners that aren't as open with the communication.

283
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,300
I think that's the biggest thing.

284
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,500
Hmm.

285
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,700
Gotcha.

286
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:34,900
Yeah.

287
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,300
Maintaining.

288
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,800
That Communications both ways.

289
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,400
It's not just yeah, on your side.

290
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,200
It's also on their side as well.

291
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Yeah, it looks like we have another question from Brielle.

292
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,100
What are the main types of Partnerships?

293
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:59,900
If you had to categorize at a high level, and do you take a different strategy for each inbound versus outbound?

294
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,200
That's a good question.

295
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:11,700
I think the main types of Partnerships depend on the company and where you're at and your stage of growth.

296
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:18,600
But overall, I would say Tech partners are or product Partnerships or integration Partners.

297
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:31,700
That's all pretty much synonymous for the same thing and then referral Partnerships and affiliate Partnerships or kind of the main three and four.

298
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,000
Taking a different strategy for each.

299
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,400
I would say that again, depends on where you are in your stage of growth.

300
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:51,100
So for us in the beginning of starting our program, we realize that a lot of our customers using type form where agencies and so that was a perfect way to get started and bringing them in as partners.

301
00:30:51,400 --> 00:31:01,800
Whereas now that we have grown a lot more we can identify what is our, you know, best partner type look like and how do we get more of those and it becomes more of an outbound?

302
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,100
Sound strategy but in the beginning, it was more inbound.

303
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:14,700
So I think it depends on where you're at in the journey and it's hard to know what your ideal partner type is until you get started.

304
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:23,600
You can say, you know, do research and say, I think it's going to be this type of company and get really specific and then you start working with those types of companies.

305
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,600
You don't you realize it's not ideal.

306
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,900
So then you have to Pivot and go to a different partner time.

307
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,700
So I think casting a wide net.

308
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:39,700
When you're first starting out is probably the best way to do it and then over time realizing what is the best partner type and focusing in on that?

309
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,900
And going more of an outbound strategy.

310
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:45,900
That's great.

311
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,200
All right.

312
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,000
Angela's got a question.

313
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,700
How do you manage Outreach to new potential partners and then how do you prioritize who to approach?

314
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,400
Yeah.

315
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:09,800
So I think that being methodical with your Outreach is the most important, instead of, you know, kind of doing a mass blast on LinkedIn.

316
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,700
Like, I think we have all received those messages and you realize it wasn't just meant for you.

317
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,100
So I think focusing in, on obviously understanding who their target audiences and making sure that's the same as yours.

318
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,600
Because then, you can say, I really do think this is going to be a positive.

319
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,400
Relationship.

320
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,500
And we're going to grow, because we have the same types of customer.

321
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:51,200
And so, you will get more of your time working with us, and we will get more working with you and prioritizing who to approach is kind of, if you are able to see customer overlap, like in tools like crossbeam and reveal, those are ways to prioritize, kind of whom to work with.

322
00:32:51,200 --> 00:33:03,000
You can see how much overlap you have, but if you don't have that, You kind of just have to do trial and error and see what works best and who's the most responsive?

323
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:08,900
And what types of partners are providing the best relationship?

324
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,300
That's great.

325
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:21,100
So you mentioned crossbeam as a tool that you used to identify strategically partners that are using type form a 10, our customers.

326
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,800
Yep.

327
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:32,500
Yeah, so you can share your overlap with a potential partner and you can see what your overlap is and Prospects.

328
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,700
You can see what it is and paying customers.

329
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,800
You can kind of see that full picture which definitely helps prioritize.

330
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:54,800
I know it's a way that we have prioritized our Integrations and kind of what product level work goes into it as well, because we can see, you know, once the we want To get the biggest bang for our efforts.

331
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,700
Oh, because it takes a lot of work.

332
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,200
Yeah, to have to get these Partnerships.

333
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,500
I mean, the process you walked us through, you know, that takes some work to get done.

334
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:12,400
So it makes sense that you guys want to be very strategic with where you place your resources time and efforts.

335
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,400
Awesome.

336
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,000
Okay, here's another question from Angela.

337
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,500
Do you manage referral reward programs?

338
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:27,199
If so, do you use any tools to manage those programs and awarding perks to your Partnerships?

339
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,000
Yeah.

340
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,800
So it's a great question.

341
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:43,600
We do have a referral reward programs, it's a rev-share model with those agencies that I spoke about, and we managed that all through partner stack which is a partner or CRM tool.

342
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:58,200
And so they will see their rewards referrals, they will see click signups, and they will also get our we have a certification program that also lives in partner stack so it's a way for us to kind of how's everything?

343
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,700
And if we wanted to email a bunch of our partners all at once, we can do that.

344
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,800
Also, through Partner stock That's great.

345
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,200
So then go piggybacking off of Angela's question.

346
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:19,100
As far as your Tech stack of what helps you get, your day-to-day work done, how would you map that out?

347
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,800
Yeah, I would say I use partner sock, the most for sure, and then type form.

348
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:37,800
We use a lot for our or like, for applications for working with cross-functional teams for, you know, our sales, team needs, a partner to get involved to close a deal.

349
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,900
They submitted type form to us and that, and then we connect that with slack.

350
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:48,700
So I think there's a lot of productivity hacks and you could almost have an entire session on that.

351
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,000
I love learning more productivity hacks and all about automation that you can use.

352
00:35:54,300 --> 00:36:01,300
And, so I would say, partner stack, typeform, slack, those are the most that I personally use.

353
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:12,500
I know on the other side of our Partnerships team, they use crossbeam a lot and seeing overlap more for their Partnerships make sense, okay?

354
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,300
Great.

355
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,200
And then as far as slack, do you create slack groups for each of your partners?

356
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,000
Or how do you manage communication with Partners in Slack?

357
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,700
That's a great question.

358
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:36,000
We have I think it depends on we try and stay away from it unless that's exactly how the partner wants to communicate.

359
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:44,000
The reason being is you don't want to have a million slack messages from your partner is just Vic.

360
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,200
A lot of times they will ask a question where it will build, you know resolve it on their own as well.

361
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,900
So we encourage them to reach out to us on Partner stack.

362
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,300
Messaging because it's just easier.

363
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,100
And that's where all their referrals and information is.

364
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:08,000
So it's one platform, but we do, you know, make exceptions for a certain Partners if that's kind of the only way to communicate with them.

365
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Then we will make it work but That's great.

366
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:24,500
It's always, you know, these details of how you work together, how we work to the community that can either like make or break these experiences and ultimately the productivity.

367
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,900
So that's why I ask those kind of questions.

368
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:40,700
Yeah, and I think, I mean, I think traditional ways of communicating are kind of being thrown out the window now and it's all what works best for a partner or for yourself and your own productivity.

369
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:52,900
So I think it's just Being flexible on what people like to do, some people don't like to get on Zoom or like, some people are video shy, and they prefer to go over email, you know?

370
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,000
You just have to be flexible.

371
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:09,100
So with that, we would love to wrap up with a point of advice or any encouragement that you have for the overall B2B Tech Community.

372
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:15,600
This morning, we heard the news about meta Letting Go almost 11,000 employees.

373
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:26,000
Salesforce, there's a lot of these lip layoffs, taking place left and right and it's just a hard time to see your friends and fellow colleagues go through all of this.

374
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,700
So you know, just being mindful of what's happening today.

375
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:40,100
And then also just, you know, with the best practices that we're all learning they today, is there anything that you would offer out there as advice or encouragement?

376
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:51,300
Yeah, I would say, as far as the layoffs and everything going on in the tech world, that can be kind of nerve-racking to see everything that's going on.

377
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:57,000
But you are not defined by your job, you know, you bring a lot of skills to the table.

378
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,500
So even if you are laid off, you know, there's a lot of opportunities out there.

379
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,300
There are areas of tech that are still growing a ton.

380
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:12,300
And, so I would say just kind of keep your head up and it's not you.

381
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,100
It's your fault and yeah, keep pushing forward.

382
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,000
And see, where can you go from here?

383
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,100
That's awesome.

384
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,100
Alright well thank you so much Mattea, really appreciate your time.
