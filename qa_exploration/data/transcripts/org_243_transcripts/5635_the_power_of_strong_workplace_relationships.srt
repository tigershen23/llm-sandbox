So, thank you so much for tuning in.

8
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:27,960
We have got a power panel today and the topic is going to be fire.

9
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:33,960
It's all about developing strong relationships in the workplace, you know?

10
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,260
Actually before I jump in note that there is Q&A because people have submitted their this is a Hot Topic.

11
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:50,560
So we have had folks submit questions in advance, upvote your most burning questions and feel free to drop questions because we're going to answer them as we go.

12
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,660
So I want to start with this pole and I have got Katie.

13
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,260
Thank you.

14
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,460
She's in the Green Room, our event producer lead, can you pull up that pole for us?

15
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,560
And let us just take this quick.

16
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:02,960
Pull.

17
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:11,360
What's the workplace relationship that has had the most significant and positive impact on you?

18
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,360
Is it a mentor?

19
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,760
A coach, a manager appear a direct report or other feel free to drop in your votes.

20
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,160
Interesting.

21
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,660
Okay, so we're seeing manager as highest wow.

22
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,660
That is probably one of the most significant relationships.

23
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,760
We're going to unpack that email a bit more, and then we got peer and Mentor.

24
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,660
Very cool.

25
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,260
Okay.

26
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Thank you for placing those votes recently Gallop had just released this study of the increasing importance of having the best friend at work.

27
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,460
And I don't know if that's necessarily your manager, or maybe it's more of a Here.

28
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,260
But take a look at that Nifty overlay there.

29
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:05,360
You can see the statistics and you know, the statistics are mentioning and you can see, you know, year over a year how much having the best friend at work?

30
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:18,660
Can truly tie back to retention and happiness at work and it's essential for social emotional support and ultimately supporting strong business outcomes.

31
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,860
And, so I want to unpack this a little bit more with our amazing.

32
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,160
Amazing panel.

33
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:36,460
If we can enter bring them up on to the stage here we have got a me who's the VP of people success that torch Elizabeth who's the head of Behavioral Science insights at torch and Vicki.

34
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,560
The VP of people Ops at bonus Lee, will you join me on stage?

35
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,960
Hello.

36
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,960
Anyway, Harry great, to be here to view.

37
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,260
Where are you tuning in from and what time is it?

38
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,860
Just curious.

39
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,360
We will start with you.

40
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,960
Vicki, I am in Colorado, and it is lunchtime.

41
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,760
Noon, noon o'clock.

42
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,660
Nice have a UAV.

43
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,360
Also, coming to you from Mountain Time Zone.

44
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:12,160
It's not very common that we have to, from Mountain Time Zone, but I am in Park City Utah.

45
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,760
Great.

46
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,960
And I am in the Bay area.

47
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,260
So I saw a lot of folks who are also in the Bay Area.

48
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:27,060
Hello, but I am on SO West Coast time so it's just a little after 11 year awesome and Elizabeth.

49
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:35,160
I am going to pause on you could you tell us a little bit about yourself and about torch, and then we will go backwards to go to a me then Vicki?

50
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,060
Yeah, absolutely.

51
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,560
So I am the head of behavioural science.

52
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,060
Insights that torch and torch is we really Torch?

53
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,860
We feel growth through the power of relationships and feel professional growth.

54
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,960
So we do mentoring coaching, and we have a Collaborative Learning platform.

55
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,660
And what I do in my role, my background is a little non-traditional.

56
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,260
I worked as a journalist for many years and then found the field of Behavioral Science and became an applied behavioral scientist.

57
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:21,860
But I think what really ties all of my interests together is this curiosity about why people do what they do and really want to understand human motivation and kind of how we learn how we grow and how we really kind of can reach our full potential as people.

58
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:42,060
So what I do at torch is I work with, lots of different teams are Behavioral Science team, our marketing team our sales team to really understand what are we learning from our platform about how people learn to grow and change over time and hopefully share things that really helped all of us do that better in our professional lives.

59
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,160
Love it.

60
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,860
Thank you.

61
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,260
Amy.

62
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,360
Maybe tell us a little about what you do with torch.

63
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,160
Yes.

64
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,060
Also hear from Team torch.

65
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:12,760
I lead our people success team at torch and people success is essentially another word for our people or human resources team, but it was really important to me as I came into this role to signal that we are here too.

66
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,660
Ali fuel, people's happiness, and success at work.

67
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:33,460
So, we actually use in part of why I work so closely with the amazing Elizabeth is, we use a lot of the science behind happiness and success at work, to organize our team and to really help people to bring their best selves to work so that they can do their best work.

68
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:43,360
So I am really excited about this topic because relationships and connection are such a huge part of our engagement and happiness at work.

69
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,860
Thanks, Amy Vicky.

70
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,060
So my name is Vicky young.

71
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,560
I am the VP of operations at bonus Lee.

72
00:22:51,560 --> 00:23:05,860
Also, another word for HR and it's also interesting is my first time working in a company that sells a product primarily to HR people, to that talks about engagement and how recognition can enhance culture.

73
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,460
So definitely it's a bit meta.

74
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,760
I think, working at places probably like, torching bonus lie, where we do a lot of research, we share a lot of information.

75
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,360
We also have to make sure that we're living that inside our company so a lot of fun to be able to do that and to do work.

76
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,260
I think (differently) than how we fizz it happens.

77
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,060
That's great.

78
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:37,260
So I want to kick off with just a very real question right now, you know, we're in this time of a lot of change uncertainty.

79
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,460
Downturn is what it can feel like so.

80
00:23:41,460 --> 00:24:04,360
So then why is building strong work relationships business critical during times like this, Yeah, I mean, I would say building strong workplace relationships is always really important but it is especially important now, and we can get into a little bit as far as what the research says on this.

81
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,160
Even though I think one of the reasons why this topic is so powerful is because we all kind of intuitively.

82
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,560
Also know, this is true.

83
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,360
We know that when we have strong relationships at work, right?

84
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,360
We're just happier people we do better but in terms of what some of the Nina sighs.

85
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,260
Let us start with kind of to Big Business outcomes.

86
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,260
That folks are looking at one is performance and the other is retention.

87
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:39,260
So, we know from, there's some great research from this research, Consortium called, connected Commons, and they have looked at the relationship skills of their.

88
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,660
They have looked at kind of what is critical to Performance.

89
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:49,360
And they found that relationship skills are really cored to individual performance team, performance and organizational performance.

90
00:24:49,760 --> 00:25:01,360
And specifically what they have found is that somebody's ability to generate energy and enthusiasm within their network is the largest predictor of being a high performer at work.

91
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,660
And they found that leaders do this.

92
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:21,160
Basically, in three ways, one is by building a foundation of trust, the other is helping others, find a sense of purpose in their work and the third is really creating energy and daily interactions and I can go into any Those in a little bit more detail.

93
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:34,060
But I really thought that was super interesting that this is, you know, when we think about high performer and what a high performer, looks like that ability to generate energy enthusiasm within their network is so huge.

94
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,760
And you know what?

95
00:25:36,760 --> 00:26:01,260
They have also found in other research and this was based on interviews, conducted with 160 liters across 20, different organizations kind of talked about the connection between Ation ships and retention and said that the willingness to stay in an organization is really impacted dramatically by the quality of relationships and somebody's Network.

96
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:09,160
So, according to these researchers, and I will quote them here because I think it's really powerful, and they found in their research.

97
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:19,360
Is that thriving at work is often as much or more about the relationships and quality of interactions with others as the type or Pace of work?

98
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:19,760
Eight.

99
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:35,060
So, and I think this gets at this kind of myth that a lot of us, hold around, hold around work which is that, you know, we have this idea of what a dream job looks like and like, oh, I really want to, you know, work on this particular topic and that's what's going to make me happy.

100
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,860
And sure that's important to your Wellness, you know, and kind of well-being and happiness at work.

101
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,560
But even more important is the relationships.

102
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:49,360
You have and so many of you responded, you know, to that opening question, how important a manager relation?

103
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,460
Essentia Paz, right?

104
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,660
Like you could be working on the topic that you think is so interesting and important to you.

105
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:02,460
But if your relationship with your manager isn't where you'd like it to be, you're probably not going to care very much about that.

106
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:20,460
Super interesting topic that you're working on the one final thing that I will say here before I turn it over to Amy who I know, has some other great information about this is they did a study, researchers did a study where they looked at connectivity across 40,000 people.

107
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:40,460
And they looked at voluntary turnover, and they found that when they looked at employees who had been there for less than one year when they looked at kind of what predicted them leaving, it wasn't the number of ties they had to other people but what did predict it was?

108
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,860
How many other people in the organization sought them out for help and advice?

109
00:27:44,860 --> 00:28:02,560
So it's not necessarily oh I have this huge Network and that's the thing that It matters what matters even more was are other people saying or other people trying to bring this person in for help and advice, which is this really interesting indicator of trust, right?

110
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,760
And of kind of wanting to keep somebody around, pull them into your teams or groups.

111
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:17,160
So, I will let a me to take it from here and share a little bit more about what we know about why relationships are so business-critical.

112
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:18,960
Yeah.

113
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,560
Thanks, Elizabeth and such powerful data, and I am already seeing lots of people asking for links to the studies.

114
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:31,760
You know, I think one thing I would just add to that is how this need is kind of universal need.

115
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,360
That's probably always been there.

116
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:43,560
But we have seen it really spike in the last couple of years with you know a move to a lot of people moving to a hybrid work situation.

117
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,760
A lot of just challenging things happening in the world.

118
00:28:46,760 --> 00:29:06,660
A lot of people soul-searching and Thinking about the purpose and the work that they do and in some, some research that LinkedIn and glint did at the end of 2020, that really struck me is looking at what drives whether or not people think that they have a great culture at their company.

119
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:28,360
And looking at the top drivers of a great culture, we actually saw that belonging increase to the number two, most important thing that drives They're not peopled love their culture and, you know, we have always known that belonging is important but that actually went up four spots in terms of impact, which is a pretty significant shift.

120
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:36,460
You don't often see that data shift as significantly usually stays pretty stable and you know it makes a lot of sense.

121
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:54,360
What people want to feel like I have so much going on in the world and in my life and where I am spending so much of my waking hours, I want to feel like I belong here and I will say to That the only thing that we ranked higher in terms of the impact on a great culture is opportunities to learn and grow.

122
00:29:54,660 --> 00:30:04,460
And I think that's just both of those like number one and number two are so critical to relationships are so critical to people's ability to feel like they belong.

123
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:22,760
And we also know that relationships have an outsized impact on whether or not people feel like they can grow at an organization you more so than a training course or formal programs having someone that invests in you and that you trust And that can help you navigate and in many cases that might be a manager.

124
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:30,260
So, those are again things that have always been important, but that have really increased in importance that people are looking to more and more.

125
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:45,160
As you know, the world of work is changing dramatically and it gets really interesting when you try to think about how to create and facilitate belonging and what often is feels like a two-dimensional screen for many people.

126
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:52,360
So I am looking forward to talking about that, that more So rich.

127
00:30:52,460 --> 00:31:01,460
I feel like I am processing all of those data points and thank you for Brian for sharing some of that research in the chat Vicki.

128
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,560
Yeah, I would plus one, everything.

129
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,460
Elizabeth and Amy are saying, I think, you know, just specially the last two years.

130
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,660
We were spending a lot more time.

131
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,660
Evaluating what we want to spend our time on?

132
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:21,760
And also I think going from a lot of office work to suddenly remote, for many people has been drastically different.

133
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,360
And how are we making those connections?

134
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,660
And I have noticed how when there is a lack of connection, you do see that attrition, you see the burnout?

135
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,160
You see the feeling of being alone.

136
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,760
Own when you're in the office you can kind of vent over the same type of thing.

137
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,060
They can talk to each other, and so we actually our company had our in two years.

138
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:49,160
Our first get to human get together in person at the end of July and the energy coming out of that was just so different.

139
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:55,360
And even before that, I think to the Elizabeth or eating might have mentioned this earlier, this is always been the case, right?

140
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,960
You have those connections with each other has always been important.

141
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:07,660
Anytime I see teams, especially cross-functionally, when they're not Working well together if you start putting them together to so that they get to know each other as human beings.

142
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,660
So it's not about work, right?

143
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:14,360
Like we literally took the team, bowling, put them on different teams, had them, you know, we put in by games and stuff.

144
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:20,060
So the team that scored the most points or do the most whatever's got kind of prizes, right?

145
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,360
And it changed the dynamic.

146
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,960
When they headed back into the office, to actually do the work stuff.

147
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:34,860
So there's a lot of, I think more empathy building, when you create those relationships, and a lot of more trust-building, when you create those relationships, That's huge.

148
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:54,260
So, you know, managers came up high in the pole and obviously, there's an opportunity and that relationship manager to employee even across department leaders to employee how if we're leader manager here, what can we do to help create?

149
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:12,560
And facilitate that environment that does build healthy team relationships Yeah, I think being a manager is really hard, especially right now and it's not often something that you're kind of taught.

150
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:18,460
Think most people are really thrown into it before they even get any training and there's a lot you could do.

151
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:25,160
So there's the building, I think of psychological safety and trust with the individual and then creating that on the team too.

152
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,860
So how are you creating space to actually make mistakes?

153
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,960
We talk about a lot of this all the time.

154
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,060
How you're supposed to do these things but How do you actually do?

155
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,160
It is a lot more difficult and sometimes not as clear.

156
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:44,560
And so being able to create Clarity for the team, helped create expectations, right?

157
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:52,660
A talking about the places where you have messed up or even how you react when someone messes up and especially under stress lately.

158
00:33:53,560 --> 00:34:04,060
So, it's a lot about, you know, you show up as a leader you and your people manager showing up you talk and just I think talking about it often times, we're trying To almost spin things.

159
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:08,360
A little too much and I think if we just show a little bit more of our human side and be a little bit more vulnerable.

160
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,360
As people managers, it goes a long way saying, you know, I care.

161
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:21,860
I do have a question about psychological safety since you brought that up is there.

162
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:29,159
Things we can do is managers today to encourage and create an environment of psychological safety.

163
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:37,159
Yeah, I would say the biggest thing is consistency in how you and oftentimes how you react to things they need to.

164
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,659
Like, our brains are wired to go and look for everything that is wrong in our environment, right?

165
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:46,360
It's kind of natural, it's just in our brain.

166
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,060
So our amygdala goes off and were like, oh my God, is that rustling in the trees?

167
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,159
Going to be this giant thing that's going to eat me.

168
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,560
And now in the workplace is it is this going to hurt me somehow?

169
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,660
And it's not so much physical anymore, right?

170
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:11,560
But psychological, so, I think creating as much space for reducing that anxiety so like hey if something is you make a mistake I will bring it up in this way with you.

171
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:25,460
So that way they know what's coming or if it's you know this is what I expect like how much vacation time for you to take so that way they're not even worried about like oh it should I even ask for this or not, right?

172
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,960
I think it's just calling out those things and saying this is how I work.

173
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,060
Here's what I look like on.

174
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,860
Distress.

175
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,960
Here's what will happen.

176
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,360
If something goes wrong, this is how I am going to support you.

177
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:40,060
So, so just really kind of opening up that box of this is how I am going to support you.

178
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:46,160
This is how you can exploit, you can expect me to do, how you can expect me to react and just reduces that kind of magdala.

179
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,960
Feeling of like, oh, I don't know what's coming next, you do because I am going to help, hopefully clarify and tell you what's coming next.

180
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,860
I think that creates a lot of safety.

181
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:02,160
The other piece is really I hate giving you're trying not to be judgmental when someone's telling you something.

182
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:10,860
So that way, they can know that they can bring things to you, that you are going to partner with them, to talk through, whatever it is, that they're going through, whether that is personal or not.

183
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,760
And sometimes, you know, we're not therapists or most of us are not there because people managers.

184
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,160
So there's a line there for sure, but it goes a long way to even just listen and empathize with like, okay.

185
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:29,860
Yeah, your kid can't go to daycare right now because there's a covid outbreak and you probably We are so distracted.

186
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,960
So let us talk about what we can do to help you kind of threw that piece.

187
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,460
It's huge.

188
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:46,960
Amy Elizabeth, is you have anything to say, regarding psychological safety, or even the previous question about, how managers can create an environment of relationship building?

189
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,960
Yeah, it I think that so many good points.

190
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,060
Thanks so much for sharing video.

191
00:36:54,060 --> 00:37:02,660
I think that the one thing I would add on the psychological safety front is also showing vulnerability yourself as a manager or a leader.

192
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:19,560
I think that can also go a long way and I think you know, so often we as managers and leaders think like we're supposed to sort of appear to have it all together, and we're supposed to have all of the answers, and we don't you know we don't want to bring up a topic and You know, exactly how to respond.

193
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:26,460
And it's just this sort of myth of management and Leadership that is what our people want from us.

194
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:35,060
When in fact, so much of relationships and human connection comes down to our shared Humanity, which is that we are fragile.

195
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:41,760
You know, people who have struggles and aspirations, and things that we're dealing with as well.

196
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,860
And so, you know, I think as much as possible creating space, you know, too.

197
00:37:47,960 --> 00:38:23,160
To be able to, to not only hear from the employee but also to share, when it's been a hard time or I have got to take off early, to go be with my kids or, you know, some of that I think makes it safe because often what I hear and what I see is that we as, as managers and leaders can feel like we are open to people giving us all of the feedback and all of the information, and we might even ask the question, but if we never see leaders role, Modeling it in then the sort of subtext is.

198
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,360
It's not safe to share that here.

199
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:34,960
So that's one thing that has been a big learning for me, personally, is just the power of sharing.

200
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,460
You know, that two-way dialogue a couple other just quick things.

201
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:52,060
I will add that kind of just piggyback on what Vicky was sharing as well is that you know there's just one of my kind of Monitors this to try to, you know, create meaning in the things we're already doing.

202
00:38:52,060 --> 00:39:02,460
So like one-on-ones are often just kind of firefighting to do's and it's so easy to get in that trap, but really making sure that you are once a month.

203
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:10,660
Creating space for that like deeper conversation and it's all like the power of great questions is always something.

204
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,960
You know, like having those teed up, I think is so important because you can always do the small talk.

205
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,860
You can always do the firefighting but it's the like really going deep.

206
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:26,760
Are one really powerful question that, especially after the pandemic, I found had a huge impact was asking, how are you doing?

207
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:49,260
And then stopping and saying, no, really how are you doing and pausing and being quiet and letting people share and that's where some of those other challenges that you know, just people can't shut off as soon as they turn on their computer can come up but then also asking meaningful questions that like get to our aspirations in the Workplace things.

208
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,460
One of my favorite questions is.

209
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,760
When do you think this is the best job for you?

210
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,560
And when do you think it's not?

211
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,260
That can just open up a world of like here is where I am so energized.

212
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:14,760
And here's this thing that just drains me and makes me feel like I am not doing my best work and that the, the data that gives you a lot as a manager allows you to then, you know, really start to, to cater to what is unique for this individual.

213
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,860
And by the way, very often, those answers could be very different for every person.

214
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,660
Not the team.

215
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:24,660
So you know I think so often what we want is to not just be one other person on the team.

216
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:42,260
One number, we want to be seen as humans and so as much as you can, facilitate questions that really get to that deeper connection than I think, you know, a lot of things start to naturally happen in your so much more empowered as a manager to really have a positive impact on your people.

217
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,160
Yeah, I love everything that you both have said.

218
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:53,760
I think just to add to this kind of question of, you know, how to create psychological safety.

219
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,060
I think building on Amy's point about powerful questions.

220
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:06,360
You know, one of the things that we also know really works is this process of active listening and part of that process is asking questions.

221
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,660
But part of it is repeating back.

222
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,260
What you think?

223
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,760
You have heard to someone just kind of pausing and saying okay.

224
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:25,860
This is this what you're saying, which is an incredibly powerful tool for to Amy's Point making people really feel heard and seen and creating that sense of safety.

225
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:31,860
Because you can really feel assured that somebody's listening to you, they understand where you're coming from.

226
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,860
And if you don't, if you don't get it right, then, there's that.

227
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,260
Powerful.

228
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,760
Question of, can you help me understand what I am missing?

229
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:43,760
Right, and I think that too, and we think about how do you, you know, kind of create those.

230
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:51,160
Conditions of psychological safety can be really powerful and also can help teach you as a manager, right?

231
00:41:51,160 --> 00:42:00,860
Like what you might be missing or what you're what, you're not totally understanding about the person in front of you and reveal some of the assumptions that you might have in those interactions.

232
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,060
So I think it's kind of win-win in that sense.

233
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,960
So good.

234
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:14,960
I see an up voted question under Q&A Katie, if you can pull that first question up, I think it's related.

235
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:23,860
But now from the employees perspective, the question is, how do I develop a good relationship with a new manager remotely?

236
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:32,460
So now then remote brings on another layer and this is from the employee perspective manage, you know, trying to build the relationship with their manager.

237
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,060
What are your thoughts to this question?

238
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:48,760
Most of my team is actually remote, and I think This goes back to the I often find we ask these questions or will go to HR and ask these questions.

239
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,060
And like, we will have you asked your manager?

240
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,860
I have you ask the employee yet, and I am like, no.

241
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,660
Not yet.

242
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:55,660
Go talk.

243
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,760
Go talk about it.

244
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,360
There's no right or wrong answer here.

245
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,260
And I think it's like, hey manager.

246
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,860
I would love to develop a relationship with you.

247
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,160
This is typically how I have done it.

248
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,760
I am curious.

249
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:14,760
Like what can we do together to, to do better there and, and I think it's Lucky that in.

250
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,460
And this might say something about my hiring practices.

251
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,660
I have to look into that, but most of my team is very relationships, based on strengths finder.

252
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:29,860
So naturally we will, we have conversations, we know, kind of what generates connections on our team and so, we will do more of that.

253
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:40,760
I make my one-on-ones extra-long now because the conversations I would typically have maybe just randomly in the hallway or because our desks are next to each other, don't happen anymore.

254
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:46,360
So I am going to make sure that happens, and we even have just It's a monthly hangout that we keep on the calendar.

255
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:57,460
We can have lunch together and just talk about just, you know, sit around and talk but I think, you know if you have got a new manager, and they haven't done any of those things yet, it's bringing it up with them.

256
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:03,060
You know, saying, hey, if and if there's a problem already like, it's making me feel a little bit isolated.

257
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,060
I don't feel connected, is there stuff we could do that.

258
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:15,860
I think that can at least generate more conversation and then idea building from not just you, but then two to the two of you Iran, how to do that better?

259
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:20,560
Or if you have got colleagues that you can already trust, always great to run things by people.

260
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,560
I don't think we crowdsource enough information and that can be super useful.

261
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,960
So, first things first, I think to start the conversation and see where it goes.

262
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,060
Yeah, I love that.

263
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,560
I know it's funny.

264
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,360
I always really big on.

265
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,560
We need our managers to like start this conversation because it can be so intimidating.

266
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,760
As you know, you come into this organization and you're trying to do these things and like, and you don't know what's.

267
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,560
Okay, and what's not, okay.

268
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,260
And so I have like four questions.

269
00:44:50,260 --> 00:45:03,060
I ask any time, I have a new employee start on my team and all of them have been remote for me, for the last probably six or seven years, because I work remotely for a while, and I was just reading through them and thinking whether I should share them or not.

270
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:08,460
And I actually think you could flip them is If your manager doesn't ask these that you could actually flip them, and they could still be productive.

271
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,760
So I will just share them really quickly.

272
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:31,460
So, first one on one, I have with a new employee, I first asked about their family and like, what's important to them and what I try to just you know, get a little bit of like they're their life like who are the people you're working for or most important relationship smoothie and your life and then you know also just kind of asked about like, what times were Work for you.

273
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,960
What's like the ideal?

274
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:41,960
You know, ideal Cadence because everybody, I seem to work with these days is pretty worried about work-life balance and like, trying to draw boundaries, especially if they're working remotely for the first time.

275
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,460
So we will kind of talk about some of that personal stuff, then I will say fast-forward to a year in the future.

276
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,160
You're thinking, I love this job.

277
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,260
I am so happy.

278
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,860
I feel so successful.

279
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,560
I am really happy.

280
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,960
I made this move like what are the conditions that made you make you feel that way?

281
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:06,160
So often when people join a company they have this like you know, really A sort of like true north and big picture of what they see, and they want to be with this company for a long time.

282
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,160
So I try to kind of get some of that out.

283
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,160
Then I asked, what are you most excited about?

284
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,760
And what are you most nervous about?

285
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,960
And the nervous one is really helpful to me, because then I can like nowhere, I need to lean in more and support them.

286
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,360
And then I will ask like, what are the qualities of the best manager for you and what doesn't work?

287
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,760
But yeah, I was just thinking I share that because I think there's some of those questions you could ask.

288
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:38,760
About, like, if I am the employee and the manager, you could say fast-forward a year in the future and you're so happy that you hired me, like, what has happened?

289
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,060
What does that look like?

290
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:43,160
Or you know, what are you manager?

291
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,060
Most excited about with me starting.

292
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,560
What are you nervous about?

293
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,860
What are the things that are top of mind for you?

294
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:56,460
So I can help you support them, but I always find that I need like 90 minutes for that first conversation because we get into a lot of (Rich) dialogue.

295
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,960
Could you drop those questions in chat?

296
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,560
Oh yeah.

297
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,560
It's a Polish them a little bit there.

298
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:06,560
Yep.

299
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,760
I would also say just to kind of build on this theme of question.

300
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:21,660
Asking one thing that's really interesting about this, is that there's actually quite a lot of evidence about why question asking works so well, to build relationships.

301
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,060
So, I don't know if folks are familiar with.

302
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:42,360
There was a New York Times article several years ago, 36 questions to fall in love, and it was based on This research by psychologist or there, Aaron who developed questions to help create Kind of intimacy and like relationship closeness in a lab, right?

303
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:53,260
And the idea being that questions, really helped create this environment of mutual vulnerability and that, that's what really makes people feel closer to each other.

304
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,660
So you know, it makes sense that across different context.

305
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,660
When we're asking people questions, I share a little bit about myself.

306
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:09,160
You share a little bit about yourself, and we kind of continue to get closer in that way as we reveal kind of more about each other.

307
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:17,760
So I think those questions that the Amy mentioned, you know, could also set the foundation for other questions.

308
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:29,160
You know, later on as you develop that relationship, that maybe get a little bit, even more into, kind of who you are, as people, what your values are what you're doing outside of work great.

309
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,860
But there's just one kind of bring that in as well.

310
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,860
And that's a really good.

311
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,260
It's a really good article to.

312
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,960
We can drop the link in there in case folks.

313
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,560
Haven't Just drop it.

314
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,560
Oh great.

315
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,860
Awesome in chat.

316
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,360
That's awesome.

317
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:53,160
Wow, there's like so much Rich information in the data behind this as well with some of these insights that my mind is processing a lot.

318
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:59,060
And in fact I would like to bring up one of the questions that came up about.

319
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,560
It's the second one Katie.

320
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:05,260
How do you communicate and interact well with difficult colleagues?

321
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,260
I am open to new ways to approach this challenge.

322
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:16,360
So I have seen some of that in chat as well, you know if there is a difficult period Where do you start?

323
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,160
I can, I can share some thoughts.

324
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:47,860
I mean, I think there's like some level of also just sort of knowing when someone's opened and with their dad and sometimes like there're some relationships where people just they're looking for something different in terms of what they come to work to get and there might be other things that are like, leading to that.

325
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:52,960
So, just trying to like, lead with curiosity, but also be aware when it might not be a relief.

326
00:49:53,160 --> 00:50:04,360
Check that is going to go beyond, you know, the day-to-day one of my new favorite questions is what would need to be true for dot.

327
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:10,460
So, you know if you felt like there was a colleague where we're struggling to work together.

328
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:22,160
Well, like perhaps a question, like what would need to be true for you to feel like we're collaborating really well or, you know, you're getting what you need from me or you know, something along those lines.

329
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:30,760
To kind of get into some of the way that they're thinking about the relationship, and they might be like, things are great.

330
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:43,460
I don't have any challenges here or well, you know, I just feel like I need to like, really get down to business more quickly or you like there could be, there could be so many things and I think it's just really hard to guess.

331
00:50:43,460 --> 00:51:01,060
And, so I think coming from a place of, I really want us to have a great working relationship and then you know, asking them what Yes, you can do could potentially give some insight that you just wouldn't be able to guess on your own.

332
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:11,860
First one is I love that Amy and it also reminds me of, and I am not sure the specific context that this person is asking about.

333
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:20,060
But I do think in times when you are maybe disagreeing on something or have two different perspectives kind of coming Head to Head.

334
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:28,260
Another interesting question is What would, what would you have to learn for you to change your mind?

335
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:37,560
And, you know, I think that's an interesting one, too, because it can help you get a sense of is this person open or not to that kind of first point that Amy was making.

336
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:48,360
Sometimes folks really might not be open to engaging in might be pretty, you know, stuck on what they think is true, or you know what they think is the way forward and that's fine.

337
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,560
But then that also gets to this question of what is going to be within your control and what's outside of your Troll.

338
00:51:53,560 --> 00:52:06,060
And so, I think that there are certain aspects of a relationship where to save yourself kind of that emotional, you know, involvement recognizing kind of what the boundaries are.

339
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:11,060
What you're actually going to be able to change in that other person or in your inner relationship.

340
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:26,660
But I love that perspective of leading with curiosity and really trying to understand the actual kind of kinship that you have first and kind of dive into some of your assumptions.

341
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:33,160
And what they kind of think is true and what might be better than well as a starting place.

342
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:49,460
Yeah, and I Dad if you can, I have seen this work, a couple of times as find someone, you know, a coach or a mentor started to talk through this with is even better if you can kind of find someone who you think may be.

343
00:52:49,760 --> 00:53:07,260
If the pain point is around, maybe the way you communicate or the way you think through things, finding someone that might think in that same way to get an idea of like it gave, this were you, what would, what would be some of that reaction because maybe there's something I am missing here and Why we keep butting heads or whatever, it is.

344
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:23,060
My husband's very different from me, and we act, I constantly use him for a lot of this stuff because he just thinks and processes kind of the same situation in a different way and it helps me catch stuff that I may not catch and then it's also a safe space to have that conversation.

345
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:30,360
So you can also process I think what you're feeling because I imagine as you go into the conversation, there's already probably emotions coming up to.

346
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:37,560
So it's hard to maybe step sometimes back and say okay I have Saying this between the two of us, like how can we fix this?

347
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:42,060
Because now we're just both frustrated in it and kind of maybe angry or something.

348
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:48,160
So, finding ways to step back a little bit, you know, look at kind of what you're reacting to and why.

349
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,160
So that way, you can figure out what their response kind of is or me.

350
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,360
What's going through their mind?

351
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:59,660
I would say huge plus, 1 to the coach or Mentor being able to help with this.

352
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:33,660
I personally have a coach who has helped me with A couple of conversations recently and one of the Frameworks that she shared as well is just kind of the ability to talk about if you are talking about a particular situation to really clearly articulate like the facts of the situation, and then the impact and the, the story you might be telling yourself as well about kind of why something why you think something happened and so detaching.

353
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:42,060
It If you can from your own assumptions or even just making those assumptions really clear, sure the person.

354
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,160
So, this is what I saw happen.

355
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,260
These are the facts.

356
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,060
This was the impact that I saw that have kind of objectively.

357
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,960
And this is why I may be, I think this happened or why you know that this is a story I am telling myself.

358
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,360
So and I think Amy you're probably familiar with that too.

359
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:07,460
I think it's it comes from some folks who Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

360
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:25,760
But I think that can also be a great way to share and a way to kind of again, try to not necessarily let your assumptions or your emotions kind of completely drive the conversation.

361
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,060
Not easy.

362
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,160
No, not easy at all.

363
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,160
To your coach and mentorship point.

364
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:44,560
What if someone is looking for a good coach or Mentor, like, where do they start to find identify a strong relationship like that?

365
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:53,160
Yeah, so I think one great place to start is, you know, a torch.

366
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,560
We do facilitate those relationships with folks.

367
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:03,560
So we have a network of many hundreds of coaches and thousands of mentors.

368
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,160
And I think what can be really great about that.

369
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:15,560
Are you end up in some cases getting paired with somebody who maybe is not?

370
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:28,260
Ready at your organization and can kind of offer that different perspectives at the same time, I think there can be a lot of value in finding somebody in your organization and being able to kind of learn from that person.

371
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:35,160
That's maybe a level or two above you, and that person kind of helping you grow in that and that role.

372
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:47,260
But I think there are, you know, they're both kind of formal ways to go about finding a coach or Mentor, maybe through like a Platform or a program.

373
00:56:47,960 --> 00:57:00,360
But then, you know, I think there's a lot to be said for identifying a person in your organization or maybe in your broader Network and, and suggesting to that person.

374
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,560
Hey, I really admire you, I really admire the work that you're doing.

375
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:18,260
Would you consider having a conversation with me every month or so or every couple weeks when I would be asking some questions and you don't necessarily if it makes you feel strange or awkward, you don't have done Really frame it in terms of like, will you be my mentor, right?

376
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,060
It can kind of evolved into that.

377
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:24,460
I know I have talked to some people who have told me like, well that sounds really weird.

378
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:31,460
I want to just ask somebody to be my mentor you know but you can take a lot of the strategies that we were talking about earlier about.

379
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,460
How do you start to build a relationship with someone, right?

380
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,160
So I think it's the same thing.

381
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:45,460
Here can kind of start slow and start by telling that person why they matter to you and why you are impressed with them and why you want to learn with them which I think can go.

382
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,560
A long way.

383
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:56,860
But really kind of starting to identify who are the people that I want to work with or who are the people that I kind of admire and why and what might I want to learn from them.

384
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:57,260
And how am I?

385
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:03,560
What I want to model those types of relationships but would love to hear from Amy and Vicki to how they think about that?

386
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,560
Vicky's anything else that you would share?

387
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,860
I don't think anything extra.

388
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,860
It's yeah.

389
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:20,560
Just kind of reinforcing everything y'all were saying too yeah.

390
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:34,860
And I mean, you know, we a lot more companies are offering coaching benefits, and so I think even if yours does not, you know, sharing asking your HR business partner or a leader like is there.

391
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:35,960
Some do we offer?

392
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,160
Like this is there anyone that you would recommend is good to?

393
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:46,360
I sometimes think for especially if you're new to an organization, you know, finding the hardest part, is finding the person.

394
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:56,460
And so, you know, that's the power of the network and part of white towards exist is because we want to make it easier for people to find those connections.

395
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:01,060
So, just would encourage sharing and looking into those types of benefits.

396
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:03,360
That's great to know.

397
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,560
So we have got believe or not, 15 minutes left.

398
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:09,160
So I want to start tackling some of these questions in queue.

399
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:31,060
A we have one that's upvoted, pretty high with the world shifting more and more digital, what more can should companies do for those who prefer an in-person work environment, especially for people, earlier on in their careers, that is such a good question.

400
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,360
And an Engineering Management.

401
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,960
Came to me, he's like, Vicki, I think we need two ships counselor.

402
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:42,260
He's a Star Trek fan, so he's saying we need a Deanna Troi, and I was like, all right, tell me more.

403
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:47,860
We started talking through all this stuff, and we realize what we're actually we brought in another manager Iranians of employees.

404
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:59,560
And we all had this discussion has been going on for months now of like, you know what we actually want is in person connection, and we are trying to mimic it as good as we can and is virtual environment.

405
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:00,860
But it is hard.

406
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:07,360
We are on when you're on resume call or meet call or teens, call all day long, you don't want to be on that screen anymore.

407
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:14,460
And so what we have been talking about is actually, all right, if we do this all company get together once a year.

408
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,060
What's the half-life of that?

409
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:22,360
Can it be kind of boosted in other ways we virtual events, and then, when do we need to get together again?

410
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,560
And then at what, what size is it?

411
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,760
Just our own team.

412
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,560
So manager and their direct team.

413
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,560
Is it, maybe the department coming together?

414
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,060
So we're still figuring a lot.

415
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,360
That out but one thing we're actually going to test.

416
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:43,260
So I can't tell you if it's going to work or not, but we have a hypothesis is we haven't really been doing kind of get togethers around like an affinity topic.

417
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:46,060
So we do these social hours right?

418
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,160
And it's like, okay everyone get together.

419
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:56,860
Most of our virtual events are in there cooking or trivia or some kind of show like one of those three things lately and so you get the same people kind of going to all those things.

420
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:01,960
So now we're like well, what if we did one where hey crocheters Knitters come?

421
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:02,960
Grab your stuff.

422
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,060
Come hang out for an hour.

423
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:04,960
We're just going to get on Zoom.

424
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,860
You're going to work on, whatever it is.

425
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:06,560
You're going to work on it.

426
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:12,460
We're going to talk because we realized because the four or five of us out cared so much about the ship's counselor topic.

427
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:18,160
We have begun closer because we have these conversations and there's a topic to be discussed.

428
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:26,360
So we're going to actually try this with kind of more things and maybe I will be like a video game night or something like that and see kind of how that goes.

429
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,960
So I don't think I have got an answer yet, but there's a whole lot of stuff that we're going to test to see if this works.

430
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:35,360
I love that.

431
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,560
I love that afraid.

432
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,460
He topic groups.

433
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,560
Yeah.

434
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,160
Yeah, it's you really well.

435
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:46,160
I have lots of opinions on this but I think it's important like contextually.

436
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:51,560
Every organization is definitely different and has different set of circumstances at torch.

437
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,560
We are remote first at this point.

438
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,960
Most of our growth has happened since the pandemic.

439
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:04,060
And so most of our teammates have basically joined Julie and stayed virtually.

440
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:16,060
We do have a few hubs and regions where we have a concentration of people, and we still have a little bit of office presents, but we're at the point now where that's kind of all we do.

441
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:26,360
But to the point of the question, I mean, you know, I think everyone a lot of people actually my head of recruiting always tells me one of the first questions people often ask is, are you really remote?

442
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:35,160
And that's like there are people that really want this and even those of us who really like working remotely Like and I really want to see human beings at some point.

443
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:41,660
So I think that largely what I am seeing is everyone's realizing is that it's not either/or.

444
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:47,960
It's really, how do you kind of facilitate both things, and so I will just share one thing that we're.

445
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,160
So we're given that we're remote.

446
01:02:50,160 --> 01:03:05,660
First were thinking about how do we really put some systems around getting together and seeing other human beings in person, it naturally happens in the places where we had office space but It's everywhere else where it's not naturally happening.

447
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:17,260
And so outside of to Vicki's point the org-wide Retreat, and then we also do functional or like smaller team retreats in between we are working on.

448
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:27,360
We have not figured out exactly how to structure this yet, but we're working on trying to make it easy for people to get together with others in their area, grab lunch, or if they're traveling.

449
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,760
Be able to Ping people that are in the Chicago area and say I am in town.

450
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,260
Anyone want to go grab dinner?

451
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:47,960
And actually like having some funds associated with that, that were actively encouraging it because very often those like one-on-one I live in a place where, like, I have had several people have come in and out to visit go skiing or something.

452
01:03:47,960 --> 01:04:12,960
And I mean, I remember the lunch that I had with this person or the coffee that I grabbed, this other person in a way that I sometimes, can't remember what meetings I was on, you know, all week, but I will remember and actually there's a lot of research around the way our brain works and that sort of spatial change can actually help things to stick in a way that being on the same, you know, computer screen, like it starts to just really run together.

453
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:26,760
So, we want to look for those like serendipitous put a little bit of structure behind it, but let people, you know, find each other and find those clusters again, we haven't figured out exactly to structure that because it gets really complicated and the funding of it and the policy and all of that.

454
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,560
But we know there's something there.

455
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:31,460
I love that.

456
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:34,960
It was serendipitous moments and changing the environment.

457
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,260
It's good.

458
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:39,760
Is there anything else?

459
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,460
Elizabeth would you add?

460
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,160
I don't think I would add anything else.

461
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,560
I think they covered it.

462
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,360
I would just say that this is a, it's a challenging thing.

463
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:52,460
And I think I don't know any organization that really feels like they have figured it out.

464
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,260
So I was just kind of validate.

465
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:58,960
The fact that everybody, if you're feeling confused going through this, I think you're not.

466
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,760
You're not alone.

467
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:13,760
Let us go on to this next question, here, how can you scale relationship building processes programs and events within a company from small departments across company-wide?

468
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:34,260
Yeah, so I think one of the first things that I would say here is relationship kind of relationship building program is one that can really help to scale those efforts.

469
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:40,660
So for instance, a mentorship program rate is one where you have some formality around.

470
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:49,460
How people are paired up, for instance, and then maybe there's some guiding questions you have a past that you're kind of being gay.

471
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:50,260
It through.

472
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:54,960
So it's not quite as much to you as either the mentor and the mentee to figure out.

473
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,860
What am I doing?

474
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,360
How does this thing even work?

475
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:02,760
But you're kind of really LED through that process and hopefully that's going to lead to better outcomes for you.

476
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:14,360
And that also means that if it is an organizational by program, you might get an opportunity to meet with and talk to people from different parts of the organization different functions.

477
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:23,560
So really kind of creating that type of relationship building that might not happen organically which can be really, really powerful.

478
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:39,660
So I think that's, that's one thing that I would share that can really be useful and kind of scaling up some of those processes and making it so that it's not just on the onus of or it's not the onus isn't just on individual managers to do all this work individual employees.

479
01:06:44,660 --> 01:07:05,560
I can add a couple of quick thoughts, one, when I think about sort of larger team size, something that, that is a really simple intervention that I love is something that I call question of the day and it's just starting out every meeting every like team meeting or formal meeting.

480
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,060
So, not necessarily a huge group at sometimes.

481
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:10,360
Well, actually even do it in the chat and our company.

482
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,060
All Hands.

483
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,860
That's just a completely non-work-related.

484
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:14,960
Added question.

485
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:17,360
That is just fun.

486
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:40,860
I have like a spreadsheet of questions that will ask that, just kind of can get people talking and sharing and sometimes I have some crazy stories of how that's like turned into US learning about something that someone, you know, someone turns out that there are musicians, and they have this amazing talent, and then they share the video that they made and then suddenly like Elite one thing leads to another and you just know someone at a much deeper level.

487
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:53,460
And I think we just I always try to think with HR programs and interventions like, just enough to help people do the right thing and it doesn't need to be this huge program, but just like plant the question and then see what happens.

488
01:07:54,260 --> 01:08:00,660
Another thing I will add is a technology that we just invested in, which is a, a start-up that's called whisk.

489
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:23,359
And it's w is q and it is essentially their mission is all around bringing more life to work and it is essentially kind of like this combination of Instagram and Pinterest but for The work environment where people can post pictures and share ideas or like a funny podcast that they listen to and people can comment on it.

490
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:30,560
There're groups and boards that you can join if you're interested in pets or woodworking or knitting or whatever that might be.

491
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:37,359
And you know, so we're trying to kind of to Vicki's point about around like getting together to work on a common interest.

492
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:51,260
We're trying to kind of create a place for those things to Bubble Up and populate, and They have a lot of cool things on their road map to where they're going to like create lounges and kind of version of donut dates that people can do through virtual interaction.

493
01:08:52,260 --> 01:09:12,760
It's a there's just trying to we're trying to it doesn't solve the like need for in person but again if you can start to see people outside of their title and there, there's a new screen that can often lead to just these connection points that get people together more, and get them seeing each other as more.

494
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:20,859
Then just, you know, that, that product manager, that keeps telling me, no, or that HR person that keeps asking me to do this thing.

495
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,359
And so we're trying to just find a lot of different ways to do that.

496
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:26,560
Yeah.

497
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:31,560
I think a lot of this is also, you know, do you have someone who can own creating this or not?

498
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,460
And if so, then what is the remit for that?

499
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:38,460
Like what, you know, what are you trying to accomplish from a program wide level?

500
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:55,060
Because that does require budget, it does require someone to kind of drive it forward and I have noticed when we have tried to do some things that are like overly consistent, it almost Burns people out, and they don't want to do it anymore, which is you think about how we interact in life, it's very organic and kind of just comes and goes and Ebbs and flows.

501
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,460
And so how do we create more of that?

502
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,360
And I think a lot of it goes back to Leading by example to.

503
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:07,060
So we have donut installed in our slack to kind of create those conversations with each other.

504
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,760
To create those questions.

505
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:12,760
I set, slack reminders, in my own team, meetings of like, you know, what are you excited?

506
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,160
About for the weekend, it comes out on Friday.

507
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:22,460
What, you know what are you looking forward to getting done on Monday and just trying to Pepper things in like that?

508
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:31,460
We even do things were randomly someone might say in the plant Channel like, hey show us your favorite plant today or in the Dog Channel.

509
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:31,860
Alright.

510
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:41,260
It's Friday afternoon with the animals and it's just a spontaneous moment that we try to generate and encourage other people to do random things.

511
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:54,760
So to Generate some of that and I think it's it is a little bit difficult but just trying to find different ways and just creative ideas and just trying it and if it does is you do it once.

512
01:10:54,760 --> 01:11:00,060
And that's it, I don't think there's anything wrong with that because again goes back to the ebbing and flowing of that's how we talk.

513
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:20,760
Speaking of Select channels, our team just started a social yell slack Channel where all you can do is type in all caps and it is probably one of the funnest slack channels that you have currently peopled are like, happy Monday and it's like shouting at you, right?

514
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:25,660
That's so fun.

515
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:30,360
I am speaking of slack, the one thing that I want to call out, this may be a less.

516
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:41,560
Exciting scaling opportunity but one that I think is really important, and we were kind of getting at the beginning to is just the consistency of communications, right?

517
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:53,260
Like I think just if you have a team, making sure that you're responding to people on slack or just kind of doing simple things every day that lead to more trust in relationships.

518
01:11:53,260 --> 01:12:20,660
So I think there's this aspect of it that can be more formal and kind of more planned right around some of these amazing questions that I am beginning even bringing up but then there's also just if my manager responds to me in a timely way that's going to also impact how I feel about my relationship with them or if I am in a meeting with them, and they hear me, and they support an idea, or they kind of give me space to speak about an idea.

519
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:23,160
That's also going to really impact my relationship with them.

520
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:30,460
So I think it's important to take into account some of those other smaller, like kind of micro behaviors to that happened throughout the day.

521
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:31,260
Additional.

522
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:39,860
And in addition to these kind of special relationship, building things that we might think about doing, So good.

523
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,760
We're already at time.

524
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,960
This topic has been so rich.

525
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:47,960

It is so rich, so thank you for the insights, the questions you have dropped.

531
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:24,660
Their, I want to go through the chat and maybe pull some of those insights.

532
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,360
Have a wonderful day, we have our next event coming up.

533
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,660
It will be a few weeks from now with a team.

And with HR transform We have got McGraw-Hill the CEO of a team, the co-founder of HR transform and Kim Roar, who we got that amazing social yell slack Channel idea from she's gonna be on this panel, and we're talking about the rise of cloud based companies, attracting and unleashing top talent in the new world of work.

535
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,760
