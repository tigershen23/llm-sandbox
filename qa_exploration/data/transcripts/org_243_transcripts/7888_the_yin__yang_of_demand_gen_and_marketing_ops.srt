1
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,600
Still, enough time to figure out how to Chase.

2
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,700
When?

3
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,800
Who loves me?

4
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,200
Aloha.

5
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,900
How's everyone doing?

6
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,100
It's so great to be here with you all.

7
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,100
I see that some of you are tuning in from places that are super cold.

8
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,000
So make sure you're bundling up, sorry to say I am in Hawaii over here.

9
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,100
So I complain too much about the weather today, but I am really excited about the conversation.

10
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,300
We have a special guest.

11
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,600
Her name is Julie.

12
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,899
Ginchy is the VP of demand gen at lob, and she's going to be joining very shortly.

13
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:24,800
But we're going to be talking about the yin-yang relationship of demand gen and marketing.

14
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,700
Ops believe it or not, that there are such synergies when you can bring them together.

15
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:38,300
Because so often we are all running, you know, millions of miles per hour with all the things going on these days.

16
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,300
So it's like, okay, well I am gonna do my thing here.

17
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,900
You're gonna do your thing here and it's so often that we operate inside.

18
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,500
Lows.

19
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:56,200
And so today, we're going to dive deep into the synergies of bringing demand gen and marketing Ops together along with the significance of getting the data, right?

20
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,400
Connecting the demand channels, adding data intelligence getting the mark Tech Integrations, right?

21
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,500
And then delivering the campaign in sight.

22
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,200
So with that Julie, come join me on stage.

23
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,800
Hello, hello there.

24
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,900
Thank you for having me.

25
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,900
How are you?

26
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,300
I am good.

27
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,500
I am very cold.

28
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,700
I am freezing.

29
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,600
My, my tush off outside of Portland Oregon, but other than that I am doing great.

30
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,300
Well stay warm get a lot of lattes bundle up.

31
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,100
It is beautiful.

32
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,600
I like your plant behind you.

33
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,100
So you're tuning in from Portland.

34
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,000
I have got this fun little map here that kind of shows like where were at time zone wise.

35
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,300
If Sal, you don't mind pulling that up there.

36
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,300
So I have got this here where we're just, you know, ocean and ocean apart, Julie.

37
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,500
I am so jealous.

38
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,700
I wish I was closer to you.

39
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:10,000
You're welcome, anytime, and another fun fact that you recently shared with me, is that you're quite tall.

40
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,800
Yeah.

41
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,900
So that's another way we're opposites, right?

42
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:26,700
You know, I think Now that I meet most people over Zoom, they have no idea that I am actually 6 feet tall which makes me taller than you know 99% of the women on the planet but yeah, it's funny.

43
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,200
Nobody knows.

44
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,000
I think it's some point I could start telling people.

45
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I am actually a centaur and that the bottom half of me is a mythical creature, and they went no, and I am like 5 feet tall.

46
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,500
So like you said Polar Opposites opposite sides of the you know spectrum and location and height.

47
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,800
So that's so awesome.

48
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,400
Okay.

49
00:06:49,700 --> 00:07:02,600
Well Julie, I would love to hear a little bit about your story and how you got into, first of all, B2B marketing and demand gen of all things.

50
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,700
Yeah, true.

51
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:05,900
Yeah.

52
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,900
So okay.

53
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,000
So origin story in a nutshell.

54
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,700
I got into B2B marketing by way of graphic design.

55
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,000
So I actually started my career with working with a lot of really wonderful B2B.

56
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:27,500
Marketing leaders who became very good friends and I work with them to launch campaigns and it didn't take me very long to realize, I want to do more than just the visual communication style.

57
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,500
So I wanted to work on targeting channel strategy analytics in the content.

58
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,200
So, for the first few years of my career, I took this kind of yes.

59
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:46,500
And approach like yes, I will design your brochure and I want to have some say in how we go to market with this product and that was over 20 years ago, right?

60
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:56,200
And that led me to transition from corporate marketing role to eventually went to an agency role and then I got two Dimensions specifically and once I was in demand, and I was pretty much hooked.

61
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:08,900
I mean, it was that magical combination of data and creativity which is my sweet spot and I haven't looked back And we're going to dive into the data and creativity with some of the insights going to share with us.

62
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,600
That's great.

63
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,300
And can you share with us today?

64
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,200
What do you do at lob?

65
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,600
What Is Love?

66
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Who do you want sir?

67
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,400
Yeah so a lob is Direct Mail automation platform.

68
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:32,500
I joined about a year and a half ago as you mentioned, the VP of demand gen, and I am responsible for everything from net, new name acquisition to the handoff of qualified sales.

69
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,200
Opportunities.

70
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,100
Gotcha, awesome.

71
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,600
All right, well I would love to jump right into our topic for today.

72
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:48,900
And we're going to be talking about the yin-yang relationship of demand, gen and marketing Ops.

73
00:08:48,900 --> 00:09:03,700
And, you know, one of the first questions that comes to mind is, what is it that creates the misalignment between demand gen and marketing Ops, What a great question.

74
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:19,900
So you know, first I have to start here and tell you that I have had the honor of working with amazing marketing operations people throughout my career and I have learned so much from them and I credit them for helping me move her forward in my career but I have seen this a lot of right?

75
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,100
The two teams think very differently so the mop steam often.

76
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,800
Lee thinks often thinks orchestration right?

77
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,800
And the demand gen team is thinking by your experience.

78
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,800
So, I will share a story from a colleague from a while ago, which I think really illustrates this.

79
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:47,600
She was really upset because her Ops team had decided to add two additional forms to our website because it was necessary for lead routing, and they were focused on how to operate operationalize.

80
00:09:47,600 --> 00:10:05,100
This asked about the leads, so they were thinking of data from her point of view, that was a horrible, customer experience that she was worried, it would torpedo her conversion rates, she was thinking of the customer experience first and the funnel and that I think in a nutshell is Can cause friction success.

81
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,300
Such a good way to describe it.

82
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:24,000
So, like, even when you go into organizations and, you know, first marketing leader that's coming in to fix things, for example, what's, what's the first thing that you do to start Bridging?

83
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,200
The two Well, the first thing is, I always ask to people that presumption of good intent, right?

84
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,400
We're all trying to solve the problem.

85
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:42,100
And then, I have actually done this exercise where I tell people visualize the problem, and then realize it is not between the demand gen people and the marketing Ops people.

86
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,700
It's not, it's not between you, it's over here and you guys have to both turn and look at that and solve it together.

87
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,500
It's really good.

88
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,100
Okay.

89
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,800
And what's the response?

90
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,900
Because they're wired differently.

91
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,400
So how do you get them to work together?

92
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,600
Part of it is its very similar.

93
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,300
Actually I have seen a similar friction point between demand Jed and like the web development team.

94
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,600
They speak different languages, right?

95
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,800
So to the best of your ability, if you can be that language translator between demand and marketing hops, right?

96
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,300
And help them understand what their goals are not how to get their vote there.

97
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,000
Or what you're trying to achieve?

98
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,400
That goes a long way too, kind of healing that friction.

99
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,700
Mmm, that's good.

100
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:39,700
And then from a, just a team structure perspective, what does that usually look like is there, is it one person responsible for all of demand gen one person responsible for marketing Ops, or could there be multiple people on each team and what are their roles?

101
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,700
So that depends very heavily on the size of your team, the team maturity, right?

102
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,300
Your growth and all of that, you know, but I think what is works really well.

103
00:11:49,400 --> 00:12:01,500
Well, if you can get to the place where you can have one person, who is the head of operations, and has an analytics person, and also like a campaign operation person reporting into her, then that works very well.

104
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:10,700
And then you have a person who is the head of demand gen and also has maybe a BM person, underneath them, growth marketing, customer marketing, all of that reporting into them.

105
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,300
So then you have a single person who heads up both of those areas that can hopefully be in lock step towards your goals, interesting.

106
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,700
So what I am hearing Because you mentioned ABM growth and customer marketing.

107
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:30,900
That's pretty much the customer lifecycle, like, you see, that whole life cycle then reporting into the head of the Mansion.

108
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,200
Yeah.

109
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,500
And so, again, that goes back to what the purpose of demand gen is right.

110
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,000
So, in my current role, I am very much focused on that new logo acquisition.

111
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,400
But in other positions, I have been responsible for full pipeline creation across the entire funnel, right?

112
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,200
Including upselling cross-selling, after a customer purchase.

113
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,700
Has.

114
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:57,600
So in that case, I do think it makes sense for the customer marketing person to report a dimension Very interesting.

115
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:04,800
Okay, I got another question here and this is all about getting the data, right?

116
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,300
And I think it goes back to what you said about aligning on goals once that's done.

117
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,700
Then, you know, first of all, describe to us why it's important to get the data, right?

118
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:23,100
Like we all kind of know this, but if you could explain the benefits of that, then that would be very helpful.

119
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,800
Then I will, then we're going to ask some other questions I have about data.

120
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,800
So I mean data hygiene is near and dear to my heart.

121
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:36,400
I believe that it is everybody's responsibility who touches the data, to keep it clean to the best of their ability.

122
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,700
It's not just marketing, it's not just sales, right?

123
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:49,400
Think of like your customer success team and everybody else who is interacting with your CRM, you have got to get the whole company aligned that it's everyone's responsible to make sure the data is accurate.

124
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,400
And here's why, right?

125
00:13:50,500 --> 00:14:02,900
Accurate data makes you did, we basically ensure that the B2B marketing efforts are all targeted to the Right individuals, that results in higher response rates, better Roi better customer experience again, right?

126
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,500
And if you have inaccurate data, you're just wasting resources.

127
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,500
You have got a real possible issue of decreasing.

128
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,800
Trust with your customers.

129
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,600
How awful do you feel when you get an email?

130
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,700
That says hi.

131
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,300
And the name is not yours.

132
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,500
You laugh, right?

133
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,900
And those things decrease trust and it also has a negative impact on your brand reputation.

134
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,200
So you have got the huge potential to Look really.

135
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:36,200
It's like or you have got the potential fall on your face or have egg on your flight face and that's a difference between having accurate and inaccurate data, that's good.

136
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:50,600
Okay, I have an another question just around data and where I guess just as far as dashboards like What tools do you use?

137
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:57,700
And what are some of the key metrics based on your goals that you're tracking with as far as data?

138
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,800
So I will tell you what's on my dashboard.

139
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,200
Typically, and again, that depends on the team's marketing, the maturity, right?

140
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:19,000
And not just a marketing team, but the sales level of maturity, but there's some table Stakes insights that you should have, you know, engagement, conversion, rate, and lead generation.

141
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
That's something that I look at constantly.

142
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:28,400
And then, as the team matures, I add things like, you know, Revenue total revenue generated from campaigns.

143
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,600
The cost per acquisition.

144
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:39,700
I also started to look at customer lifetime value is, I think that's, we tend to be a little bit short-sighted in the marketing team.

145
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:46,500
Like let us get the leads in, let us see if it creates five applied, and then we say yes, we success succeeded but that it's way more than that, right?

146
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:52,400
It's really the return on marketing investment and then I would say next the final level, right?

147
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,800
So that if that's more mature, you got to get down to channel performance.

148
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:07,600
That's incredibly important right now because we're all being asked to do more with less right more Pipeline with less money, in the way that you do that is you invest in the channels that are converting the best.

149
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,700
So, definitely I should be something on your dashboard right now.

150
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,500
That's good.

151
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:22,100
Okay, then this goes right into some of the kpis that marketers should be delivering for campaigns, which you might have answered some of those.

152
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:29,600
But for your team, specifically, what are some of the kpis that you're monitoring?

153
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,900
And how frequently do, you monitor them?

154
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,600
So our first kpi is Pipeline and in dollars.

155
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:49,400
So that's the first thing that we look at, and I would like, I know this sounds a little crazy and I don't know if I want to meet this, but how often do I monitor it every hour or two depending on whether or not?

156
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,700
It's a weekend break away.

157
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,100
So, you know, it's my version of obsessively, refreshing, a dashboard and looking at where we are.

158
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,099
So I think that's probably the number one, right?

159
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:08,099
Then we want to see of all of the pipeline that we created from marketing's effort.

160
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,200
What moves through the funnel and what is the conversion rate from?

161
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,599
You know, sales accepted sales qualified and then eventually bookings.

162
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,599
So that's one of the first things that we Monitor, and then we go back.

163
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,800
And we say, what did it cost to get that pipeline that bookings.

164
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:33,600
So you should have some Benchmark right now, for every dollar that you spend that you're going to return x amount to the business and Pipeline and or x amount in bookings.

165
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,500
So we have that, right?

166
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:42,900
That's a benchmark, and we try to always hit it or improve and that helps me make decisions about again where to spend money over to course, correct?

167
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:53,900
So for example, if we're trying to create let us say, $10 a pipeline for every dollar that we spend, if we as see a Channel or a campaign way below that we first asked, like, we do something wrong.

168
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,800
Can we course correct?

169
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
If not is this valuable, do we want to keep spending our time here?

170
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Because it seems like we could be doing better results in another Channel or another campaign that makes sense, as far as frequency of checking the channel performance per Channel, each Channel, obviously from email to LinkedIn, you know, their SEO.

171
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:25,000
There's like completely different timing of when they're successful or not.

172
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,900
So do you have like a sense of how frequently you check certain channels or any advice on that?

173
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:39,300
Yeah so we recheck most channels for what I would call leading indicators immediately, right?

174
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,600
Like activity metrics.

175
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:52,600
If we're going to send an email, or we're going to send a webinar registration, for example, it's fun to actually look at like, you know, let us take a look at how many people registered but registered as an activity metric.

176
00:18:52,900 --> 00:19:02,200
So, I think as you are in mid-flight for a campaign, you should be looking at your leading indicators in real time, right?

177
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,200
And again, that's just so you can course, correct?

178
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:12,700
Because if you put a lot of money and time into creating a webinar, if you're not hitting your registration and goals, you're not going to hit your attendance goals, you're not going to hit your demo request.

179
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,800
You're not going to arise, just going to keep going down and you want to keep that from happening.

180
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,800
So I think you should be looking at all the time.

181
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,800
Hmm.

182
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,700
It's good.

183
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,700
How do you differentiate then tracking those channels versus campaigns?

184
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:36,100
And can you define even the difference of the two and the type of kpi's that you will look at for each?

185
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,400
Oh yeah.

186
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,600
Okay.

187
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:47,400
So, you know, we think of a campaign as a collection of channels Pride that lasts more than, you know, I would say six months, right?

188
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,900
So let us say a campaign last six months, we're going to use multiple.

189
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,900
Almost because we have an off day Channel approach to get everybody through whatever conversion point we have defined.

190
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:10,800
So for example, right now, we are doing our annual state of direct mail campaign, we use email, social pushing, will, use retargeting will use in product advertising, and all of those are different channels.

191
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,500
And then what we do is all of those channels roll up to the campaign.

192
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:22,300
So we use, you know, UTM, basically parameters to make sure that we are tracking The performance of every channel.

193
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,100
So we can say this is the amount of money that we spent on this channel.

194
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Here is what it returns on investment.

195
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,800
And then we roll up all the channels to the campaign and report on that as a whole.

196
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,400
Mmm.

197
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,500
It would you say a good amount of time for a campaign?

198
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,000
Run is about six months.

199
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Yeah, so I know a lot of people differ on this.

200
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:54,600
I have heard anywhere from three months to a year and for us, what we do is we have different levels of like, basically tears of campaigns, We have some that we expect to run six months, maybe a little bit longer.

201
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,400
You know, they have long tails, nine months, and then we have what we have like, short run campaigns, that could be three to four months.

202
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,500
Can you give some distinguishing factors?

203
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,900
Like what would a short-term campaign sound like even messaging?

204
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,400
Why is versus a six-month campaign?

205
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:23,300
Yeah, so I six-month campaign to us would be like a big top of the funnel thought leadership campaign that has a lot of reach.

206
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,400
We have the potential to get a lot of people really high in the funnel.

207
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:33,600
Then we have shorter campaigns that are usually middle of the A funnel and are targeted towards, for example Industries.

208
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:45,600
So there's a smaller subset of people to talk to but higher potential of conversion rate, but we know we're not going to be going on and on about thought leadership, they know who we are, and then we just want to move them down the funnel.

209
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,800
Gotcha.

210
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,300
Okay, it's very helpful.

211
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,200
Okay.

212
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,400
So then my next section here is around connecting demand channels.

213
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,500
What are some of the things to consider when you're connecting the channels?

214
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,200
This is really good question.

215
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,800
So, you know, I let me start here.

216
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,300
I think most folks don't realize that connecting your channels takes way more than technology.

217
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,700
The goal is to create a seamless tracking, right?

218
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,700
Of customer interactions.

219
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,600
Us all the channels for all of the reasons that I talked about earlier.

220
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
We were talking about database Health, right?

221
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:31,700
You want personalization across all channels and that takes way more than technology, by the way, that takes by in, right?

222
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:46,500
So before you even think about integrating tools, before you get to this question about apis, you have to start by talking to your marketing and sales leadership, get them together right and get the no line on what the goals are for your technology, what?

223
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,600
Fields, you're going to use, right?

224
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:58,200
I mean I honestly I had a dollar for every time I have seen sales, pull a report and marketing say that's not the right field, I could have retired already.

225
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,700
Don't use that feel.

226
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,600
That's the line I hear the most.

227
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,300
We're talking about operations.

228
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:19,200
Then also you have to agree like when you're going to track but how you're going to report on it and most importantly, when you're going to review the data, when you're going to go back and actually, Make recommendations to improve it.

229
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:29,900
So that's a that is a lot of consensuses building and I think that is the part that people miss out on Who's responsible for the consensus building?

230
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,600
How does that work on the marketing side to then the other teams?

231
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,300
Yeah.

232
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:46,500
So if you had that magical person who is leading up the marketing operations person, they should be at a level high enough that they can negotiate that conversation, that would be ideal.

233
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,100
What?

234
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,700
I see and I think a lot of companies are moving towards is a revenue office function, right?

235
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,500
That is integrating marketing and sales Ops together.

236
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,500
And then the revenue Ops person is basically the one who holds the keys to the kingdom.

237
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,600
Hmm.

238
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,600
Mmm, gotcha.

239
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:10,200
So they would be responsible to provide the direction the Insight recommendations on which channels to connect and why.

240
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:26,800
Yeah I mean and I would say specifically they have got to get everybody who is responsible for operations, not just marketing but sales to and leaders who own targets by blind and bookings into a room together and understand what the goal is and then come up with reporting.

241
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,900
That works for both teams.

242
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,400
Hmm.

243
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,100
Okay.

244
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,500
So I want to dig into this.

245
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Have you seen examples where it's not happening consensus isn't happening?

246
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:47,800
What are what does that look like when it's not happening and what are the outcomes versus when it is happening?

247
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,700
And I like to hear some of the attributes of that.

248
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,700
But first, it's like what are the attributes of?

249
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,300
It's not working.

250
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:08,900
So here's what you will hear, what it's not working marking will say, you know, we generated X percentage of the pipeline, this last quarter and you're inside sales team, and your sales people will do this.

251
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,800
No, you did.

252
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:25,100
That's when you know, it's not working that or, you know, we see these conversion rates, and they say, no, that's not what, that's not how it feels, right?

253
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,100
It's all those numbers that nobody Buys in, you know, across the organization.

254
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:45,100
That's when, you know, it's not working when it's working, is when you get a lot of head nodding, and you say, okay, we all agreed that we were going to use this logic to pull marketing's attribution.

255
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:56,800
Whatever it is whatever your look back model is whether it is a multi attribution multi-touch, we agreed going in and since we agreed on that, this is the number that it is turning out.

256
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,100
And now that we have all agreed that this is the right number.

257
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,400
What do we do to get better?

258
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,300
That's what it looks like when it's right.

259
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Ah, I feel like not a lot of orgs, especially when you get into, you know, series a series be right?

260
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:24,500
You may not have time to be able to do this, you may not have resources so in a limited resource, type budget, constraint environment.

261
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,000
How do we build consensus right away?

262
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,700
Well, that is very true, right?

263
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:41,100
Most startups are starting their really far behind on this, right?

264
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,000
And if you can't do multi-touch attribution, at least agree on a single touch, right?

265
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,700
Let us start there, what is the most accurate?

266
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:57,900
Single touch that we can all pinpoint to giving some kind of credit for where the of the pipeline is created.

267
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:07,800
And by the way, you know, I use the word credit because that's what people understand, but the goal isn't really to give one team over another credit is if you're out what's working versus what it isn't.

268
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,100
Right, that's what we want to do, so we can do again more of what's working.

269
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:18,400
So, I think if you can even just get consensus on a single point of attribution, it goes a long way.

270
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,700
That's great advice.

271
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:30,600
All right, adding data intelligence, what are some ways you can enrich your database?

272
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,400
Oh, others.

273
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,100
So there's lots of ways, but before you reach your database, right?

274
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:49,000
First you, start by cleaning it because really were talking about is data intelligence and you get a lot of data intelligence just by removing duplicates, correcting errors, just analyzing data, all of that stuff.

275
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,200
So that should be step one.

276
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,800
Then you look at what systems you have that you can pull data from, right?

277
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,700
Do you have any kind of predictive intense software?

278
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:05,600
So we do we use he's like sixth sense to determine whether or not it.

279
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,700
We're seeing buying signals, right?

280
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,500
That's a way to enrich your database.

281
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:19,500
Do you have any kind of real time data streams, like, your website analytics that you can pull on to gain a more comprehensive understanding of your customer behavior?

282
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:29,000
And then like, basically what other systems do you have already that you can integrate your CRM or Erp, anything else that is a single source of Truth.

283
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
All of those should come in to enrich your data.

284
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:45,000
So, yeah, there's lots of things that you can pull that a lot of companies, even startups have internal processes that have in back for collecting and valuable data that just aren't pulled into fields that we can use and getting them in.

285
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,900
There is very helpful.

286
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,800
That's great.

287
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:56,300
If anybody has questions for Julie, feel free to drop them in the Q&A tab as or going as well.

288
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,800
Okay?

289
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,100
And when you're talking about cleansing and enriching the data, who do you generally partner with to do so?

290
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,200
So if you're asking like a vendor, there are multiple data providers that you can try, right?

291
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,900
So, you know, I think one of the more popular ones is zoom info, but I know seamless AI.

292
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,300
There's a ton that are on the market right now so the goal is to do a test right?

293
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:30,200
I always say do it accuracy test before you partner with any vendor and see you know ask them what their expectations is for leave quality.

294
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,100
So you know we use zoom info.

295
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:43,100
I was pretty happy with it but then there's all are Our inside sales, folks are always updating data in real time when they're interacting with Buyers, or they're out on LinkedIn as well.

296
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,400
Gotcha.

297
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,600
Okay.

298
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,100
Mark Tech Integrations.

299
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
All right.

300
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:04,300
In addition to your CRM and marketing automation platform, what are other integration points marketers should consider Oh boy.

301
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,200
Okay, so there is a there's a ton the depending on whether your B2B or b2c.

302
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,300
Let us say we have our analytics in our data management, platforms attached.

303
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,500
So if you have any kind of data visualization or business intelligence tools, you might want to connect those.

304
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,300
If you were B to C your Ecommerce platform, of course, right?

305
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:37,200
And then there's some other ones that I would say, our state table Stakes, like your social media management, let us see your advertising and paid media, you connect, those one of the ones that People don't think about is that you could Connect customer feedback and surveys.

306
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:37,900
All right?

307
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:44,800
So you could be actually, for example, measuring customer feedback and measuring customer satisfaction it.

308
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,600
Real time off your website, then, connecting that feedback back to your database.

309
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:58,800
And then when you realize that somebody has a positive net promoter score, those are the folks that you go after for the positive reviews on your, you know, software review sites.

310
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,100
For example, So, yeah.

311
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,500
And then, you know, the other thing, I web personalization, right?

312
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:14,900
If you want to have an intelligent conversation online with your key accounts, you have got to make sure that your database is what I clean that everything's connected.

313
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:25,800
Can I ask what tools you're currently using for web personalization, and like, certain things that are you're connecting?

314
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,700
What are tools that you're using today?

315
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,800
So we're actually the evaluation process for Mutiny HQ for our website personalization.

316
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,200
Nice?

317
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,600
Yeah, yeah.

318
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,200
And we want when we want to use it as part of basically are a b x approach.

319
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,600
So, you know, we want to make sure that when somebody from we can identify, when someone comes from one of our key accounts, and we can give them a personalized experience.

320
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:51,700
So, yeah.

321
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,500
So that's our next step back in maturity.

322
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:14,300
So, thinking about that customer life cycle again, and the different tools that you plug in play across the customer life cycle, if you're just start from that initial top of funnel experience and that could be a mutiny personalization experience with your web pages, all the way through.

323
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:23,600
Could you just give us very Typically, what are some of the tools that you're currently deploying and using across the customer life cycle.

324
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,300
Yeah.

325
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:33,300
So we use sixth sense to at the very top of the funnel to look for buying signals.

326
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,300
And we will from there, we put them in different programs, right?

327
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,700
So it could be retargeting ads, we might actually put them into email campaigns.

328
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:55,900
We use Marketo for email, we use Salesforce for our CRM, and we have the added bonus of being able to use Direct Mail, Right since we're a drachma automation platform.

329
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,200
So we use our own software for middle of the funnel conversion.

330
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,200
So we have an integration.

331
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:16,000
Even with a data provider that integrates a pixel on to our web pages to identify individuals, not just accounts and matches them with their home address.

332
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:24,700
So that allows us to basically trigger a postcard to any person who is an anonymous web videos that are two are high value pages.

333
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,100
So that's a really fun integration Point.

334
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,200
I have never got to do anywhere else.

335
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:38,400
I have worked How exciting and then how does that just continuing on that customer lifecycle with once, they're converted as a customer?

336
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,700
What kind of tools do you use their own after a?

337
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,200
So that's where it gets a little bit out of my purview in my organization here.

338
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:58,600
So, you know, we at that point, they actually convert to like, basic that our account management side, and then we think of them as a potential for a new business, right?

339
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,400
So then they go back to the top of our funnel.

340
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,700
Well, and we look at our large customers, and we say, where can we sell at a different business unit?

341
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,800
And we start from the very beginning again, right?

342
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:13,600
We say, where do we see interest, and we start the whole process to try to get another business unit down the funnel, That's great.

343
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,400
Thank you for walking us through each of those.

344
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:22,699
I think that's really helpful for some of us to hear and compare back to the Sixth Sense top of funnel.

345
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:39,000
And when you're looking at intent, what are some of the key signals that indicate low, medium, high intent, Yeah, so we look at both branded searches and unbranded searches.

346
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:48,100
So you know if somebody is looking, for example, lobs Direct Mail software versus film, The competitor named, that would be a high intent, right?

347
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:53,000
They look like they are in the part where they're looking to narrow down the vendors.

348
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:58,000
They try to figure out whether or not they have a problem with a solution is that's a really good indication.

349
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,500
Right?

350
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,200
Versus let us say someone who says what is direct mail or what is direct?

351
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:13,100
An automation there are a lot higher up, and they're going to need some of our educational thought leadership of why direct mails important, how it works as a marketing channel, but they can expect to see for the ROI.

352
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,700
So you get a lot, you can learn a lot from that from just looking at that.

353
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,300
And also you know it's very interesting.

354
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:31,900
One of the things that we're going to be integrating very soon on our website is a search functionality that gives us real time feedback about what people are searching on our website for the same reason, right?

355
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:37,300
We want to understand What people are looking for to get the solutions that they need, right?

356
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,600
And that will also help us figure out where they are in the funnel when they get to our site.

357
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
That's so good.

358
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:52,100
Have has lob thought about using a chatbot, something like drift or qualified ever and maybe you do already, we do.

359
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,300
Yeah.

360
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,000
We use intercom right now.

361
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,600
Gotcha.

362
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,300
Yeah.

363
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,000
So it is, it is a chatbot, although we kind of have a hybrid model.

364
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,600
We have our inside sales folks, moderate sometimes.

365
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,300
And then the chat pod when it's off hours, Yeah.

366
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,300
Great.

367
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:17,500
Wow, so rich, I love how you're taking us from high-level 30,000 feet strategy and getting right into the tactics Julie, it's really great.

368
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:30,000
You know, I am as we're thinking about our B2B community and just the whole Community is rocked right now.

369
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:51,200
And you, and I have talked about this even outside this event of like, wow, it's just such a time of like you said, being able to Each your time and your resources with, you know, you're doing a lot more with less and there's burn out right now and there's, you know, this sense of insecurity or instability.

370
00:36:51,200 --> 00:37:01,400
And so, do you have any words of advice or even encouragement for your fellow B2B marketers today?

371
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,500
Yeah, I mean, I am I am feeling it.

372
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,700
We're all feeling it.

373
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
I can't even go on.

374
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,500
Until the LinkedIn anymore because it feels like Doomsday scrolling right now.

375
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,000
I understand, you know.

376
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,100
So I guess first is the first thing is this too shall pass, right?

377
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,400
I have been doing this a very long time and I know what is unique about.

378
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:34,000
This is that we just have come off a 10-year Bull, Run of Technology, being almost impervious to all of the issues with recession and everything, right?

379
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,100
So it's the first time I have had a lot of people in the workplace have gone.

380
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,900
This, but it isn't for me, right?

381
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,100
I remember the.com bust and lots of marketing.

382
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,600
People went through it back then and we were covered.

383
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:59,100
So I would say right now, here's what I am very much focused on understand your Tamil performance so you can show the value of what you're the value of Pipeline and in bookings of every dollar that you're spending.

384
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:13,200
That's number one, the two is, make sure you are facilitating conversations with the entire Breyer groups rather than just the Decision makers that you have identified because of layoffs and job hopping.

385
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,900
Those people move very, very quickly.

386
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,300
So make sure that you are multi threaded into opportunities.

387
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,300
You know, I am very interesting change that.

388
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,500
I see a lot of marketers make right now, is that there used to be this idea of?

389
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,800
Once you open an opportunity its hands off, right marketing, can't touch it.

390
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,500
Now, it's in the sales horn.

391
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:40,400
And now what we're moving towards is once the opportunity is open now we account warm, right?

392
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:52,400
You have to go back in and get as many different tethers you can into that buying unit because we lose people so quickly now and that's a big shift that people are making and that's probably the best word.

393
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,000
I second I can share right now.

394
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,900
