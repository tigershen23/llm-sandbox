1
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,500
Did a full 180 crazy?

2
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,700
Don't show up.

3
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
Anything could stop me.

4
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,200
Hello everyone and welcome.

5
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,300
I am seeing people are tuning in from not so sunny places from sunny places.

6
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:47,100
It don't matter, you're tuned in, you are here with us today, and that makes us so happy and Overjoyed to have you.

7
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,700
As today's panel discussion, is going to be really hot.

8
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,600
We have got John Miller.

9
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,300
Who is the CMO demand base?

10
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,500
Nate Dame.

11
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,900
The CEO profound.

12
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:07,400
G + MK, the CMO of Loop and tie to talk about the expertise of the joint synergies of ABM and SEO.

13
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,400
So this is going to be a really great discussion with these experts.

14
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,800
You know, B2B buyers we know this 2023.

15
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:28,200
They want personalized self guided experiences, according to this recent stat by trust radius, 87 percent of buyers want the ability to self serve.

16
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,300
Or all of their buying Journey.

17
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,100
87%, okay.

18
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:40,600
Buyers, love it because then they can take their own time and Pace to explore research and purchase on their own terms.

19
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,600
We're seeing those touch points prior to conversion, go up, especially over the last couple of years.

20
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:57,600
And so if SEO and ABM are created in silos and isolated from another, which can happen often times, then these important parts of the buyers process.

21
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,700
It doesn't get the feedback that you need from sales.

22
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,900
There's a lot of other things, I am not the expert on this.

23
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,200
So this is what I want to unpack with our panel today.

24
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,800
So before that, we're going to take a quick poll and let us pull that up it.

25
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,700
I just want to get a check here.

26
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:26,700
How many of you are currently leveraging your SEO and ABM in conjunction with one another?

27
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,300
Go ahead and just drop your votes there.

28
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,200
All right.

29
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,600
Okay, so we see a much greater percentage oh kind of sort.

30
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,600
As we got some maybes and some nose and not as much of the yeses.

31
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:50,200
Okay, all right, all right, well with that, I would love to introduce our wonderful speakers to the stage.

32
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Come enjoy a beer.

33
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Hello, hello.

34
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,200
Hi there.

35
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,900
How's it going?

36
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,500
John 8 MK.

37
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,300
So, great to see where each of you tuning in from.

38
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,400
And could you give us a little introduction?

39
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,600
I will start with you, John?

40
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,300
Yeah.

41
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,300
Hey folks, glad to talk to you.

42
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,800
I am in Burlingame, California, a little South of San Francisco.

43
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,400
I have been in the Mart tech industry for years and years.

44
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:28,800
I was a co-founder of Marketo I was the CEO and founder of a company called engage you in about two and a half years ago, we merge engage you and demand base to create the leading ABM platform.

45
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,900
And now everyone is the CMO there.

46
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,299
I worked with at least one of our other panelists met Fred Marketo and engage you.

47
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh, so it's really great to have the opportunity to chat with him on this panel, as well.

48
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
And where are you tuning in?

49
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,000
From what city Burlingame.

50
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,700
California, a little South of San Francisco.

51
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Nice.

52
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
All right, I will hand it over to you.

53
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,700
Nate.

54
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,100
Sure.

55
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,100
I am in Lake Geneva.

56
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,700
Wisconsin.

57
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,000
Southeast Wisconsin.

58
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,200
Just above Chicago.

59
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,000
Someone already chatted.

60
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
I am not a Packer fan.

61
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,800
I am a Chicago transplant.

62
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,500
Wisconsin.

63
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,000
So I am a die-hard Bears fan.

64
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,500
Although my kids have been stolen over the Packer side.

65
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,600
It's a sad story.

66
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,300
Yeah, John and I worked together years and years.

67
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,100
For quite a while.

68
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Marketo, I run an agency called profound strategy or an SEO results partner, we go high-growth scalable predictable, SEO campaigns for technology companies.

69
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,800
Amazing.

70
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,000
It looks like we just lost MK.

71
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,300
So whenever she jumps back on, well, there you are.

72
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Presto change-o, seems you said money.

73
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,600
Yes.

74
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,800
83 times usually for me to appear but I gave you two.

75
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,300
Gotcha.

76
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,000
Hey, okay, so where are you tuning in from and could you give us a little intro?

77
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,800
I am not tuning in from anywhere.

78
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,400
Nearly as cool as California.

79
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,700
But I am dialing in from Rhode Island today, where we are expecting some snow in a tiny estate.

80
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:00,900
Here in the US, I am the CM 0 here at loop antenna, and I am thrilled to be able to talk to you about Pat top.

81
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,100
I said I am particularly passionate About in a, a VM and SEO.

82
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,100
Awesome, thank you.

83
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,000
All right, well, we're going to jump right into some of our questions here.

84
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:25,000
You know, it was interesting to see those results from that poll where majority of us are probably kinda sorta or not at all, using ABM and SEO in conjunction.

85
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:35,300
So one of my first questions is, where do you start with even thinking about bringing a BM strategy and SEO strategy in alignment?

86
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
And I am going to hand this over.

87
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,200
Huge on initially to kick it off.

88
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Yeah, you know, I mean back when I was starting engage, you know, I used to use this analogy to describe a VM, you know, I talked about the sort of inbound manj and kind of marketing.

89
00:10:50,200 --> 00:11:08,800
We did, it Marketo is fishing with Nets where we'd run our campaigns, and we didn't really care which fish, we caught we just cared if we caught enough fish, whereas ebm is what I like fishing with the spear, where would go identify the big fish that we really wanted, and we would reach out to them kind of proactively.

90
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:18,800
Yeah, and in those early days, you know whether I was intending to are not, I think I was purposely setting up sort of either-or dichotomy, right?

91
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,400
You're either fishing with Nets or you're fishing with Spears, you know, and I think a lot of people struggled with that a little bit.

92
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,300
However, fast-forward.

93
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,900
Gosh, seven plus years later.

94
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,000
I have come to learn that.

95
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,700
That's its more nuanced than that.

96
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:47,400
And what you actually have is something that looks more, like a spectrum of different go-to-market styles, you know, ranging from truly bespoke 1, to 1 atm.

97
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,200
You know, for deals that might be worth 2 million, 10 million, 500 million dollars a year.

98
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,500
You know, or if they talk about 12 few, which is good for deals, maybe half a million a year or so.

99
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:22,000
Um and then one too many ABMs which is appropriate for say a hundred fifty thousand or two hundred fifty thousand dollar deals and then you even have you know, just targeted demand gen where maybe you 50,000 Dollar Deals where, you know, you have a pretty wide universe of companies you're going after but you still want to be a little relevant targeted.

100
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,400
And a lot of companies span across these different deal points.

101
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,300
And so, I think, rather than thinking about it is an ATM strategy or demand gen strategy.

102
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,500
I think the beginning, your to answer your question, specifically about, how do you start by building an AVM strategy?

103
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,100
Aligns with your SEO strategy is to realize they aren't in Conflict.

104
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:52,100
You know, you have one go-to-market strategy, which happens to span different styles and which you just got, you're going to use different tactics for different kinds of deals.

105
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:01,900
And as we will talk about more, you know, some of the tactics and to being very complimentary that's great.

106
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,900
I think it's great.

107
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
I think it's spot on.

108
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,600
And to be honest John has built a framework for thinking about a VM that's still so relevant.

109
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,900
In fact, I saved his engage eoe book and pull it up again.

110
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:25,500
Yesterday, talking to my team about our own AVM programs, our doing scale campaigns to micro segment today, and we're talking about a strategic level Campaign, straight out of John's ebook.

111
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,900
So anything this guy says about a VM is tends to be pure gold.

112
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,700
What's interesting is thinking about, sorry to be over the top.

113
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:40,400
Top John but what's interesting about SEO, and we want SEO to sit next to a BM SEO.

114
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,300
Could be seen as a huge net and ABM could be seen as a spear.

115
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:59,600
And, so I think it's also important to think that these two things should coordinate, but they don't necessarily serve each other exclusively, SEO, conserve, a lot of broad purposes that might tie closer to brand or tie into other objectives.

116
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,200
To just be present when your buyers ask questions, May even be a strategy to plug leaks in a high scale.

117
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,500
ABM program, where you still have a leaky bucket.

118
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:18,000
I just be because people are searching questions as we do on Google, and they find answers that your competitors have answered.

119
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,400
And you got to be there too.

120
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,900
So they can tie together, but they're also quite distinct in the end the spectrum of how you might design your programs.

121
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,300
I love that.

122
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,300
I think when you also meet you're using SEO as I have wide.

123
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:40,600
Expansive, net SEO, coupled with the right engagement tactics through your avian strategy can also be the bait.

124
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,400
So not only your dredging, the ocean floor with some of your SEO strategy, at the highest level of intent.

125
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,300
In your keyword search, you can also be getting a lot more granular with that keyword searching.

126
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,500
How you start optimizing site pages to be hunting down certain fish, so that you can have them in close range?

127
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:05,200
To shoot with your sphere with a BMI think we teased our, the oceanic and fishing and metaphor to its fullest extent.

128
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,800
Right, that's good.

129
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:32,900
I definitely see that complement complementary nature in the way, each of you are describing a VM and SEO and how they can work together, you know, I think about the buyers journey, and from here's my qualified opportunity and then all the way through to conversion and Even post sale, could we get a little bit Technical and that flow?

130
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:40,300
How do you see ABM and SEO working together from even before qualify table?

131
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Like what's that whole experience from awareness all the way through Yeah, I mean I mainly that off.

132
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,000
That's okay.

133
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,000
Sorry.

134
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,500
If MK4 about to speak there, you know?

135
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:59,700
I mean I sort of think I mentioned tactics that were complimentary you know, so I think the first one is there's this concept of.

136
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,700
What's people talk about his intent data, which is a really key part of ABM intent?

137
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,900
Data is your.

138
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:15,800
When you can sort of see what topics your target accounts are researching and reading about.

139
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,600
Out on the open web, I can get into more about how that data is figured out.

140
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:36,300
But, so I think Step 1, Campari tactic is when you have identified your target accounts, using 10 data, to see what topics that read about what keywords they talked about and then that's a pretty good Kion, kind of what you should be focusing, your SEO strategies on.

141
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:45,700
I think second when you, when company comes like a little further down the funnel, a company comes to your website.

142
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,200
You know, 98% of the time, they're going to be anonymous, right?

143
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,400
They just Googled something and they found you another F.

144
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,000
ABM tactic is to DN optimize that web traffic.

145
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,500
You don't, you're not going to hear who the person is, but you can figure out what company they work for based on their IP address and their cookie.

146
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:11,000
And if you see that this is coming to your site and it is a target account, you know.

147
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,300
Now you can actually personalize that webpage to recognize them.

148
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,400
Maybe you just the content based on their industry or other things, you know about them.

149
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:31,700
So you're being more relevant and more personalized for that kind of organic traffic and then last, you know, late in the sales cycle, to me that's all about validation and consensus.

150
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,900
Making the hiring committee feel safe with this purchase.

151
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:53,700
You know, and I think you can often times you're going to have some buyers like an executive who hasn't really been involved with the buying committee whose like, hey, what's this demand-based thing that were purchasing, you know, and they're going to answer that by typing something into Google and see what comes up.

152
00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:01,200
So making sure that your SEO strategies also include late-stage validation, I think would be a third tactic.

153
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,000
I talk about okay.

154
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,900
Looked like you were going to speak right?

155
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:18,100
When I started talking there, I mean you, you summarize it so beautifully, the only, yes, and they have to the framework that you put out there for folks, to look at is also bifurcating.

156
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,700
Some of the data points you have with folks who have boots on the ground talking with your customers.

157
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:34,000
Obviously, I think one of the most important stakeholders in any of your ABM, or ABX strategies, or your sales team that you get to work alongside with, but I actually find it really interesting to spend time.

158
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:42,000
Working with your customer basing teams post-sale to understand a lot more about what is really compelling and helpful for them post.

159
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,500
So where they get hung up, where they get stuck on either product adoption, where they start to gain traction.

160
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,700
That time to Value multiplier.

161
00:18:50,700 --> 00:19:04,000
To post sale is a really interesting way to build a top-down SEO strategy, starting all the way from awareness coming all the way down to decision to understand how to maximize that time to Value quotient.

162
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,400
For your customers.

163
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,300
Success teams?

164
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,200
Yeah, good point points.

165
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,400
It's interesting.

166
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:23,200
I think the intent data is one of the most valuable B, I know, and we're working with clients for kind of sometimes, looking over the fence like, oh, well, your will your ABM, your marketing team over there.

167
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,000
Give us that intent data as well.

168
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,900
We want to just tap into that pipe, it transfers to SEO.

169
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,400
You can think about intent data.

170
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:46,400
When you look at keywords, we think it's important to level that up a bit when you're doing your then getting tactical that Co so you know exactly what you're targeting exactly what you're getting and that Actually tie really well, even to last-minute, validation, with Executives.

171
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:57,500
There's this interesting Trend where many tech companies seem to have this user need at that, we call an SEO, this user need like, what is a BM for Adam and base?

172
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,000
What is what our webinars are?

173
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
What is a webinar platform?

174
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,500
Maybe for something like, welcome, what do they be?

175
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
I am gifting for something like Loop and tie.

176
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,200
What is the name of your category and there's an intent, or we call it a user need far more?

177
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:19,700
Avec than the intent and a modern SEO program will can hone in on the user needs that matter and sometimes he's this Wild Thing Happened.

178
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:26,200
So for many B2B tech companies that we worked with these highly generic user needs their specifically.

179
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:47,000
What is the topic, their core vertical will find that, you know, no one wants a Target that because it's generic a high level, but we often advocate for it and because time and again, we find the highest Revenue attribution to those pages when they gain traffic and earn traffic and keep it.

180
00:20:47,100 --> 00:21:11,200
We see the highest revenue attribution to those pages and our best consensus it from that is we don't find those pages generating leads predominantly early in the process, but I seem to be gaining that attribution late in the stage, or when our best assumption here, the data is hard to always specify, it's a it gets messy, right?

181
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:11,800
Right?

182
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,800
But it's that it really seems like executives are doing exactly.

183
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,000
Like, John, described.

184
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
What's ABM again?

185
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,500
Oh, let me, let me Google it.

186
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,300
Oh, and I got a great answer and by that answer, by the way that answer came from demand base.

187
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,500
So yeah, let us move forward done with that.

188
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
What's my next decision?

189
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,300
So good.

190
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:38,900
Wow, just a Sal had said if there're any questions that, any of you have, feel free to drop them in the Q&A tab, as we're rolling here.

191
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:51,300
So what it comes to optimization throughout that occur throughout the entire funnel, how do you see ABM and SEO working in compliment?

192
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:57,800
I assume that there's going to be feedback loops and how does that happen on a week-to-week monthly?

193
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:09,200
With, but the teams Yeah, I mean they saw you got this one.

194
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,800
Sure.

195
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,700
I think that the right mechanisms are important to the right feedback.

196
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,000
Loops are important rate schedule.

197
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,900
The right, Cadence.

198
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Most importantly, I would say that each program needs to have its own established goals and objectives which are probably not the same.

199
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:37,800
And then we're asking the question to say, how can, you know, now that we're say it's two people running each program, how can we help each other reach your Everett goals by collaborating, right?

200
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,100
I think it's a mistake to say, well, we got these two programs, they should work together and Magic will happen.

201
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,400
We used to hear that all the time.

202
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,500
And sometimes we still do.

203
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:51,600
If you do SEO and you do paid search and like you coordinate them, it's the silver bullet and often.

204
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,400
It's not, I mean, you can do a lot of work that we don't fight.

205
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:02,900
We haven't found a way as or it's like this Silver Bullet of just magical explosion of leads or Revenue, anything, you know that you can coordinate.

206
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,600
So I think maybe I am an SEO.

207
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,800
Aim separate objectives to contribute to higher level company, objectives, and the question for the teams.

208
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:28,000
And for leaders, helping those teams collaborate is, how can these two programs help there, you know, coordinate to help their individual goals being achieved better and that should be the question that drives collaboration and should drive the Cadence should drive how, you know, obviously to share all the data.

209
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You can, you know, make decisions via the written word publish your conversations, you know, don't just have a rambling meeting.

210
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:43,800
Things but use the written material and use document of material so that it's much easier for others to see what's happening and jump in and jump out of different context.

211
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,100
But ultimately the, the goal of collaboration should be.

212
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:52,200
Hey, can you share something so that each team's goals can be reached faster and better?

213
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah, plus a million to that.

214
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I love to think about to what could see be seemingly.

215
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:07,700
Disparate tactics like SEO and sem or sorry, an ABM have mutually shared kpi's.

216
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:17,100
So you have your discrete performance metrics that really, are you roll up metrics the overarching company successes Nate said but there should be mutually own kpi's.

217
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:27,500
I think one really important one is conversion rate, optimization metrics and understanding more about the Enter the audience, that's coming and then how that intent is actually yielding conversions.

218
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,800
And ABM obviously spending a lot of time thinking about conversions and how to get high quality High intent, folks over and into the hand of the sales team.

219
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:50,100
So, by appointing, some of those mutually shared kpis, there's a lot of really good Synergy and how the teams come together to collaborate and share this, Mutual goal to drive forward and actually start to orient themselves around.

220
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,200
One another's discipline.

221
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,300
Sookie.

222
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,200
Right there.

223
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,100
The, the alignment of those objectives.

224
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,400
John did, you have something to add to that?

225
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,400
I have talked a lot already.

226
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:04,900
All right.

227
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,600
Well, we have got a question that came through that I think is also relevant from Jose.

228
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Do you have a framework or template?

229
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,500
That you can share to map, SEO, content, efforts to the ABM Journey.

230
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:42,900
I am going to I mean to me that does start back to the intent keywords and I mean if you get one, you get really sophisticated, you could look at the keywords that the accounts in your kind of early stages, what I would call a qualified or awareness stages.

231
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,200
Are using and are those keywords different from an account?

232
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,700
That's deeper like consideration.

233
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:00,100
What I might call marketing qualified account, you know, and those might be different keywords that the ones late in the stage or using.

234
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,200
And again, this is sort of the magic of intent data.

235
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,600
Are you can actually see what kinds of topics and articles your accounts are reading about?

236
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,100
Out that's how I might think about that.

237
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,800
John could you dive into that a little bit more?

238
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,900
How do you see that with demand Base today?

239
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Like if you were too just to give us some examples of your buyers and what their intent search looks like order?

240
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,300
What does that experience look like?

241
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,800
I want to show me answer the question properly here soon every company that provides intend data follows.

242
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:46,500
The same basic algorithm, you know, it's basically you have got a person on a webpage and step one is UD, anonymize that person's company you know.

243
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:55,900
And again you don't know who that individual is because that would be not part, you know, breaking privacy, you know, ethics if you will but it's okay to figure out what company they work for.

244
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,800
And then you can do some natural language processing on the page.

245
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,700
And lo and behold.

246
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,700
You see, huh?

247
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,400
This person from Dell is researching event Solutions.

248
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,600
And if you saw just one signal of that, it's probably not that interesting.

249
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,700
All right, but when you start seeing, whoa.

250
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,000
Okay.

251
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,800
There are 7 people researching this a lot and that's three times the amount of activity last week.

252
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:32,700
Now sudden you like maybe something's happening, you know, and I want to kind of focus a little bit more time and attention there and so you get kind of two kinds of intent data.

253
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,200
You get kind of just Baseline levels.

254
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:42,900
These accounts are generally reading about these topics and then you get these surges like wow there's a lot more going on.

255
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,800
Something I might want to pay attention to something demand-based.

256
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,000
We get our intent data by mining, the advertising, Midstream.

257
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,500
So we basically are seeing everywhere.

258
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,700
Web page that has a display out of it, you know?

259
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:06,900
So, every article, every news publication, you know, all that kind of stuff, other content providers like G2, or trust radius, their mining, their own review sites.

260
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:15,100
And so we all get intent data using the same basic algorithm, but by mining different data streams.

261
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:16,700
Yeah.

262
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,900
Hopefully that answered your question very helpful.

263
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,700
Yes, thank you.

264
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Yeah, I think Jose another option to depending on where you are in your journey with this is having a centralized document to that looks at, you know your ICP and it could be different types of icps and kind of laying out a matrix of sorts of your SEO and the keywords that you're targeting based on a tent based on the customer journey.

265
00:28:42,600 --> 00:29:07,000
And then also layering right next to it Nea be IM strategies that compliment where that person is in that strategy and ideally, with that Matrix, you will be able to look at your SEO and ABM strategies and find complementary areas for your SEO to do some of the dredging that we talked about earlier in the call and your ABM to really get in there and start spearfishing to capitalize on the intent.

266
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:20,100
When folks actually hit your area, the pond, You know, I have a lot of opinions and a very love-hate relationship with keywords.

267
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,800
I think that they are an excellent start and can take you very far.

268
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:29,500
I also think that if we can take our keywords one step further, we go to be a lot.

269
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,600
We can I think that's what's needed to compete in SEO, and to get heat in SEO today.

270
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,200
A modern SEO versus traditional, kind of throw on the wall SEO.

271
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,400
It will throw spaghetti on the wall.

272
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,400
See What sticks, you know, publish 100 blogs, maybe one of them, kind of ranks.

273
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,500
The rest of them, don't you actually just lost a lot of money and are not ordinary engineer.

274
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,100
Any traffic to show for it?

275
00:29:51,900 --> 00:30:05,000
We use this, we use a model and methodology to hone in, on the user need, which is the, the exact need and exactly how by John described it where, what is the need of page meets?

276
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,300
Not just a keyword but also the need that paid me to.

277
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,600
My, my comparing Solutions am I learning about High level of the solution.

278
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,100
Am I comparing this solution versus another solution category?

279
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:22,000
I am asking specific questions about that solution and so that's we call the user need, which can be of a more specific intent.

280
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,500
Try to we're building software, you tried a lot of NLP.

281
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Algorithms can't find a tool that automates that yet.

282
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,300
It's human.

283
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:39,400
Editors human marketers that are deciphering user need and but once you know, the user need and the SEO world, you know, exactly who's waiting for that need.

284
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,700
It's usually three to five pages.

285
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,000
Has.

286
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:48,500
And then from an SEO standpoint, beating them isn't is not creating just another page with a keyword on it.

287
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,500
But actually a page that is does as good as these guys.

288
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,300
And even better than meeting that need.

289
00:30:54,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Because there're thousands of pages that have met that need and you have to be the very best, you know, because Google is going to see that the people engage with that page even more than the others you have to be better than.

290
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:12,900
And it's just a far cry from traditional approach to SEO that, you know, I would be published a lot of blogs, but the keyword in it, Open pray and you know, you end up losing money.

291
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,200
So if you can transform and align your content strategy is so concentrated.

292
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,100
Use your needs.

293
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,000
You know what pages?

294
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,300
You need or Pages you have that, you need to increase and you can map your intent data to those user needs as well.

295
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:39,100
So that when people are on search with that intent, they're getting, they're getting you as the goal and Jose, you probably know, you know, we're going to be could talk all day long about user needs.

296
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,000
But when, you know, those user needs and can Catalog them and prioritize them.

297
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:53,600
That's the foundation to then winning that traffic and SEO actually winning and then incredibly competitive, you know, world or landscape of search results today.

298
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,800
Such good points.

299
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,300
Wow.

300
00:31:59,400 --> 00:31:59,700
Okay.

301
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,100
My wheels are turning right now, and I am just thinking even about what you just said made about you.

302
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,200
Each of you mentioned user needs.

303
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Is there a good number of needs that we should be identifying?

304
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:32,600
Or is it just based on like okay this is really spiking John like you said, and should we map those needs out then according to each part of the funnel How do you recommend to strategically hone in, as you said on those user needs across each stage?

305
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,100
I would argue that is the sort of most fundamental strategy.

306
00:32:37,100 --> 00:33:02,400
Well, there's two, what are the top two most fundamental strategies behind ABM, you know is understanding where each account isn't as journey and then customizing you know segmenting and customizing your message accordingly you know and therefore Knowing, you know, that an account that you might be interested in, but is not even aware of the pain, right?

307
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,000
That you need to message that company.

308
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,200
Very, very differently from one that's spiking intent for your category.

309
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:21,800
So that's the first core fundamental as the other one is you can't focus your resources equally on the every account so you should know really prioritize interior accounts to put more resources on the more valuable accounts.

310
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,900
Those two things are probably a VM in a nutshell.

311
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,200
Yeah.

312
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,300
And to borrow the analogy of a BM is that spear, you know again, SEO can play with nicely with that.

313
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:43,300
But it is the net next to it where when anyone has a certain user need if you will when anyone has that need and if you win in the search landscape you're going to capture that.

314
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:53,700
So you want to know as again as I was alluding to earlier when people that are Target account land on your site because I went through that need.

315
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,100
You want to be sure you're a VM team.

316
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,700
Knows that and can respond to that even if they're brand-new visitor to your site there otherwise Anonymous, what do we will identify them?

317
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,300
And potentially, take action, SEO, cast that wide net.

318
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:14,199
If you have a good program that can compete in at the, you know, tightly competitive landscape of search today, and be present for that.

319
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,800
Need your hopefully going to capture anyone that's there all the time, right?

320
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,000
You got your booth in the trade show of search results, right?

321
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,300
And you're at the top and you're the biggest Booth, well, your ABM your target accounts.

322
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,800
They only represent 2% 5%.

323
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:38,600
20% of the people that are doing the search which the searching SEO wants to capture all those that are valuable and convert them to Pipeline and opportunity.

324
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:46,300
ABM you want to be sure that your VM team knows that leads to someone that they can should throw a spear at.

325
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,699
I also think the needs are really important way to align your team.

326
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,000
There's intent.

327
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:15,700
There's also the marketing teams, way to harness that intent, but your team's ability to actually action against that intent and use the context of understanding the need fundamentally understanding, the need to match the reaction towards intent is a really important except there's nothing worse than coming into an ABM strategy.

328
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,900
That was so thoughtful.

329
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,600
All men, all of my needs address everything.

330
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:31,400
I needed only to be met with that next human-to-human interaction, that feels so disconnected from the holistic approach, starting all the way from the very beginning until the point that you talk to a person.

331
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:39,800
So don't underestimate how important needs are in need alignment, internally is to create continuity in that customer Journey from dark funnel.

332
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,500
All the way to meeting the first real life human at your organization.

333
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,500
That's huge.

334
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,700
All these points.

335
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,400
Thank Q.

336
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:58,400
When talking about that alignment, how do you see that actually happening across teams just tactically week-to-week like, how, how does that happen?

337
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,900
Meet just to clarify your question a little bit.

338
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,500
Like, how do you align your teams around needs and your ideal customers needs?

339
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:14,900
And making sure we don't, we don't miss, you know, to your point like making sure we don't miss those opportunities.

340
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,900
Yeah, I mean Tales always time it's marketing and being able to align your team's.

341
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,800
That's one of the most foundational things.

342
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:43,100
I think when it comes to a VM or ABX holistically understanding how to really get your team communicating effectively with one another around those needs and understanding their role in shepherding, someone through they need diagnostic problem of the self-diagnostic problem.

343
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,000
I think it's really important, secondary.

344
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,900
Really, I think also too, just it's cannot be understated.

345
00:36:49,900 --> 00:37:01,100
How important documenting the needs are and then documenting every person's role and responsibilities around those needs, are we talked a lot about documenting, SEO ABM?

346
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:06,900
But if you're not sharing those resources, if you are not providing that transparency for alignment around those needs.

347
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:16,100
It's hard for other folks to know how to get involved with the skill sets that are in their repertoire to carry that journey and make that customers experience a seamless and smooth as possible.

348
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:16,400
School.

349
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,100
I think this is, this is huge.

350
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,400
I feel like a lot of the misalignment internally can happen just because of the lack of some of these things.

351
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,800
You're mentioning the lack of documentation, the lack of communicating.

352
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:39,600
And, you know, asynchronously and synchronously aligning from objectives, kpi is all the way through to feedback and optimization.

353
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,300
So I think that's a huge Point.

354
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,200
As a lot of us are probably working remote or hybrid.

355
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,300
So This is, this is good.

356
00:37:50,700 --> 00:38:01,400
You know, one of the questions that I have is around, identifying your perfect buyer Persona and leveraging, both SEO and ABM to do.

357
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:11,700
So, how are you seeing it with your own company and your own Persona is like, how have you seen that honing in process take place?

358
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,900
And what does that look like?

359
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:26,100
I have been lucky to go to worry about ideal account, ideal person ideal account and person.

360
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:36,500
I guess I will tackle the ideal account one first, you know?

361
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,400
So the framework.

362
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,400
I like to use for that is called fire fire1.

363
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:57,000
So the effing fire stands for fit and, you know, this is really if you look at the, just the information about that company, are they a good fit with your other customers?

364
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,800
Their industry, their size, their Station.

365
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:06,100
If you're a technology company turns out, one of the most important factors for fit is what other Technologies do.

366
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:13,800
They already own complementary Technologies, competitive Technologies, one of those Technologies up for Renewal, all those types of good things.

367
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,200
The I stand for intent, which we have talked about, you know, really like where are they?

368
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,500
In their Journey, you know, do they have?

369
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,200
They never heard of this category or they actively research.

370
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,200
The r stands for relationship, you know?

371
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,000
And this is really, you know, do you have contacts in history with this account?

372
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,800
I mean, maybe you.

373
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:38,000
Maybe they just hired somebody who wasn't your customer at a prior company.

374
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,800
You know, maybe you did a close loss deal because they weren't ready to buy six months ago.

375
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:53,200
But now they might be, you know, all that context and relationship and then the he's engagement and this is really representing.

376
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,500
Are they engaging with you and your company?

377
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,800
Are they coming to Website, are they attending your events, do they open your emails?

378
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,800
You know, that kind of thing.

379
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:22,700
Each of these, I think are interesting ingredients to use when your sort of tried to identify that ideal account because all things, you know, obviously want the good fit, but all things being equal, you know, knowing where they are in their journey and what context and how engaged they are also matters as well.

380
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,900
So I will take that on the company one and leave.

381
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,200
The person one may be for others.

382
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,300
That acronym is really strong.

383
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,700
So that's fire stands for fit.

384
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,800
Intent, relationship and engagement correct.

385
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,600
Thank you.

386
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,800
You do on the ABM side, running our own programs.

387
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,300
I only have two small items to throw into that.

388
00:40:48,300 --> 00:41:12,500
Number one is if there are any defacto and I will say automatable if you're trying to scale an ABM program and there're certain aspects of a company's technos technology stack that can be that is existed in your CRM and you can process hundreds or even thousands accounts just to churn out the probable.

389
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,200
That's before you do a manual review.

390
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,800
It's incredibly powerful.

391
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:29,500
So always look to automate as much depth Z as many steps as you can to get down to the right fit accounts and then and frankly leave room for even two for higher scale, ABM programs.

392
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:35,800
You're trying to reach many hundreds, even thousands of accounts leave room for reasonable room for human review.

393
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Don't just grab a proposed list.

394
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,500
That's a team member found, and we're excited about our first.

395
00:41:42,600 --> 00:42:03,300
I am at it but allow yourself and engage and encourage your team to spend time in human review and to those doubts concerns or what about that come up, it's far easier to Target the right accounts and even a smaller list of the right accounts, then a bigger list of mixed accounts.

396
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,900
That's great.

397
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,800
Thank you MK.

398
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:16,100
Did you have anything there about the buyer in particular narrowing in?

399
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,800
Yeah, I am plus ones and Nate suggestion about getting some folks to partner with you.

400
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:32,300
For some real time, testing the Persona that you're using on top of the company fit for your business, I would be remiss if I didn't say that, that fire acronym was fire.

401
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:38,700
John's, I appreciate you sharing that with us, but there is something to be said about some of the feedback loop that you get.

402
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,200
Partnering with your business development teams, if your team has won, I have been lucky.

403
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:51,700
I have worked with a couple of different companies that have been at different stages of implementing a VM, and complementary to their SEO.

404
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:04,800
And some of the need suggestions about great creating smaller list and testing against Persona types of testing, the needs framework testing your messaging framework against certain job types.

405
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:12,900
And job titles has been a really fast feedback loop from marketing to In up additional testing for ebm strategies as well.

406
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Thanks MK.

407
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:28,200
I am going to jump to this question on SEO analytics and how that can provide insights to the ABM campaigns.

408
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,500
As they're progressing, Nate I am going to hand it over to you sure.

409
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:46,800
You know, I think the reality and forgive me for repeating myself, but the reality of the competitive nature of SEO today, modern SEO is about competing with Was it ends, right?

410
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,200
You're trying to win the gold medal.

411
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,400
You're not just trying to go down to the local gym and swim for some exercise.

412
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,400
Like and if that's how you treat SEO, like I am just going down to the gym couple times a week.

413
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:07,700
The reality is that you win and you learn traffic, your SEO campaign delivers Roi when you win the gold medal or the silver or the bronze.

414
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,200
That doesn't mean it's impossible.

415
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:16,000
It means do the right things and really see who's winning and figure out how I can strategically beat them.

416
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,000
And it's very doable and it's a scalable approach.

417
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:25,300
And if you're doing that and you're getting traffic, I think you want to understand what traffic.

418
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,600
What are the what portion that traffic are inside of your target accounts?

419
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,200
What portion that traffic are part of your target account?

420
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:34,700
Set?

421
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:42,000
What portion are not, I consider it successful, no matter how much traffic were getting.

422
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,000
If we're moving the needle, I am tired accounts and pipeline generated.

423
00:44:47,000 --> 00:45:00,500
I think the biggest mistake that's made in a SEO campaign that begins to take off is some level of leadership will say, you know, only 5% or 1% of this traffic converts.

424
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,300
Well, let us not look at direct conversion.

425
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:09,100
Let us look at Revenue attribution and broader metrics with a water time scale.

426
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,800
Regardless, the question isn't.

427
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,900
Just, what percent of traffic, converts, what's the ROI on the traffic?

428
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:21,200
How much is attributing to Pipeline and impacting pipeline directly or indirectly?

429
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,200
And if we're seeing a good impact on Pipeline SEO is a wide net.

430
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,500
You're going to see a lot of traffic.

431
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,100
You're going to see a lot of students researching.

432
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,100
You're going to see, maybe there are nonprofits, that's not a Target account.

433
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,200
Just companies that aren't a Target account.

434
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:41,300
You're going to see a lot of trap people with that need only a small percentage of might be those that are Target account.

435
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:46,800
So the question is in what percent is really driving in a VM programmer, Having leads.

436
00:45:46,800 --> 00:46:00,600
But rather how much revenue or pipeline can we find that since that's measuredly associated with RSU initiatives and the co-worker That's huge distinction?

437
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,000
Thanks name.

438
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:12,500
We are sorry, if we in our customers generally, find that it's pretty useful to look at all your web analytics with that kind of account overlay.

439
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,300
On top of it, it's kind of what Nate's needs getting at, you know, you know.

440
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,600
So it's not just, hey, what am I traffic sources?

441
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,200
But you know what?

442
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,800
Am I traffic sources for the Target accounts?

443
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,100
You know what?

444
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,200
Not, just what page is convert the best.

445
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:45,800
What pages, convert the best for the Target accounts and to do all that you obviously need to build a connect, your DNA on immunization to your Analytics, And if I may just because it's free, I don't mind promoting a little bit.

446
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:53,900
Demand-based does have something called account ID, free where any company can just go and install our tag on your site and connect it to your Google analytics.

447
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:54,900
And we will do this for you.

448
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,800
Oh sweet.

449
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,500
So just you can search, you know, account ID free on our site and get it.

450
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:03,700
Good to know.

451
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,100
Awesome.

452
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,000
Alright, so here's another more tactical question.

453
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:17,500
How do you leverage SEO and ABM to build clean retargeting audiences?

454
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,800
Anyone else want to go first?

455
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,600
I do know that you're done, we want to learn from you.

456
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,400
Yeah, I think you have got the most to say John, but I do know that SEO.

457
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,200
Can, if you're getting a lots of high-value non-branded SEO.

458
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,800
Traffic retargeting is a must for sure.

459
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:49,400
Retargeting is generally how you drive the most conversion possible from the visitors that came to you from SEO in total.

460
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:59,700
Its I would call it a must But yeah I know John what were your thoughts the way I like to think about it.

461
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:10,100
You know is if you're only retargeting the target accounts then you're going to minimize your wasted money.

462
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:30,300
You know, typically, you know if you're just doing a regular retargeting campaign, you know, you very well may be retargeting that student or that you know, who was never going to be a customer, but when you take that account ID lens to it and say, all right well these are the companies that I can actually sell to.

463
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:37,900
They're the ones getting retargeting, you know, typically I think you're going to get better results and this matters.

464
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,100
I mean we did a study across.

465
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,300
Every company of ours that has our tag on the site.

466
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:56,800
So, all of our paid and free customers and across that whole universe, only 37 percent of the traffic coming from search to company sites.

467
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,800
We're we even able to identify it as coming from a business.

468
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,100
Let alone a Target account, you know?

469
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:11,300
And so there is, I think a fair amount of waste on this but, you know, it's even broader.

470
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,600
I think you goes back to that Journey.

471
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:23,100
You know where you have got that qualified account, you know, which is not even like be what you're interested in them, but they don't even know.

472
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:32,700
There's a problem, you know, and you know, you should know how do you reach out to them using something like display advertising, but it's not retargeting.

473
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,800
It's account focused advertising distant, try to build some awareness of the problem and Trust in your brand.

474
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,300
Then if they start showing some intent, now, you want to kind of catch their attention.

475
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,900
Tension to bring them to you.

476
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,200
And you thought leadership can work really well.

477
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,600
And now once you have got them to your site, that's when the retargeting can kick in, you know?

478
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,800
So I also like a theme.

479
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,100
We have had this whole, this whole conversation.

480
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,100
It's a line into the journey as well, hmm.

481
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,800
So good inside as well.

482
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:16,300
Bridging, the Divide between our last question and this question and making sure we're going really far down the funnel to understand where were generating revenue.

483
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,300
And also how we're generating Revenue that is not only retained the potentially expands.

484
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,500
I think that becomes a really interesting lens to layer on top of your retargeting efforts.

485
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:34,000
And it can't be understated to how important it is a knowing, how your business, like, what your business is and how it converts.

486
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:44,900
Just About this free traffic tracking tool as a great lead generation strategy of freemium strategy, product LED growth strategies.

487
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:57,000
Those strategies do need to be laid over top your retargeting strategy, to make sure you are not wasting the efficiencies, in your spend, you're gaining efficiencies and you're spending your retargeting campaigns as well.

488
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:04,100
Efficiency is the key for this year to name of the game.

489
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:08,300
So that's these are really insightful points.

490
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,300
Thank you so much for sharing.

491
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:19,800
So let us say we identify and narrow in on those that are Target's, even in the, in the retargeting.

492
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,200
How do we drive the engagement up?

493
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:29,000
John, you mentioned a few things about thought leadership and different things, you know, across that entire funnel MK.

494
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,700
I am gonna throw this one out.

495
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:38,800
Do you like what are some things that we can do to really double down on the engagement with high intent buyers?

496
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:45,200
And at what point should we be pulling those levers and tripling down?

497
00:51:47,500 --> 00:52:04,000
Yeah I mean I would be remiss if I didn't talk about gifting somewhere in the answer of boosting engagement with your high, in 10, high value accounts, but I will copy it that by saying that Gifting just by sending someone to give cars by throwing something like that.

498
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,900
To someone to try to get them to convert, or spend time with you is actually winning in efficacy.

499
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:20,900
So making sure that the tactic that you're using to boost engagement matches the authenticity of the need of the moment and of the audience that you are targeting.

500
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:29,600
I think there's a lot of really fun and interesting ways to engage with folks and capitalizing on their need first.

501
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:38,100
And I am working outwards is a really valuable way to examine your options and the exploration of Engagement with folks.

502
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:44,800
For example, if their need is I need to see more Intel on who's coming to my website.

503
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,700
Then creating an amazing free tool.

504
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:54,400
Like demand base has is an awesome way to engage with your community creating a webinar.

505
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,700
Like this to help folks, who are maybe just starting off with SEO and a VM and trying to find complementary.

506
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,300
Geez to boost efficiency.

507
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:05,900
He's there in, is a really great way to engage with folks.

508
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:22,400
The rule of thumb that I advise folks out on finding the right engagement tactic is to understand what's going to help someone authentically connect with your brand and learn about your domain, expertise, through that experience.

509
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:32,800
And when you layer that lens on top of the engagement tactics that you have available to you, you start ruling out things that feel a little Official, you start ruling out some of those engagement tactics.

510
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:41,000
That feels a diamond doesn't from everybody else's playbooks and ABF, but I will say coming all the way full circle back to gifting.

511
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,500
I do think gifting has a vital role to play in account-based execution and I love seeing it.

512
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,700
Be used as mid-cycle accelerators.

513
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:58,200
I love it, being the relationship accelerant in a sales cycle, it's not the best door opener.

514
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,800
I think it's like I said, waiting and See there but it's a great way to show.

515
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,000
Hey I am a real human.

516
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:11,700
I know you're a real human and it's a really fun time and a place for us to partner to help one another in are mutually shared objectives moving forward.

517
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,900
So that's really interesting that you're saying that it's not best.

518
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:25,300
Maybe be leveraged at the very top of the funnel that like, hey, get a free gift, you know, you don't know me.

519
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:36,200
Well, but yeah, you don't know that Brian gifting is really kind of Channel fundamentally above it all, but it also, there's a quid pro quo kind of nature to it, right?

520
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:52,800
Like you are going to give someone a gift card to get something in return and so that ruse, I think it like I said, is not working as well, for some folks who know that on the other side of getting five dollars to Starbucks, are going to have to sit and have someone go through the pinch of sorts.

521
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:59,900
And it does the lost the intent of a gift is just completely with lost in the meaning of that exchange with someone one.

522
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:06,500
So post-relationship being established is where, yeah, you recommend.

523
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:19,800
That's my Pro tip for folks who are thinking about incorporating getting into their avian strategy and don't forget, your customers are also great, great marketers for your business too.

524
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,900
So post-sales celebrate celebrations, through gifting is also great to account-based.

525
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,700
Marketing doesn't stop at the first point of sale.

526
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,400
That's a big one.

527
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,900
That's a whole other webinar right there.

528
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Yeah, for sale might have to invite you guys up for that conversation, as we have got four minutes left.

529
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:48,900
So this has been an incredibly Rich conversation, you have taken us way, 300,000 stretch, strategic level thinking very tactical to the ground.

530
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,400
I really appreciate it.

531
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,900
