16
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:18,000
All right, so we're going to kick this off and jump into a pole, you know, burnout and fatigue is at an all-time high.

17
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:29,100
And what we're seeing is that leaders that portray empathy in with their teams with especially with a distributed or hybrid remote.

18
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,200
Workforce.

19
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:41,200
We're finding that the it's not only successful but it's a strategic Advantage for leaders that truly lead their teams with empathy.

20
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,600
So on a scale of 1 to 10, how well do you feel your leadership team leads with empathy?

21
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,500
Okay, everyone.

Feel free to submit your votes.

23
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:59,100
Okay, we're seeing this, so we got some fours, some fives, majority sixes right now, and we have got a few tests.

24
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,500
Tense, 7% says 10.

25
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,100
All right, okay.

26
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,900
Okay, adjusting real-time there.

27
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,500
Okay.

28
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,200
Well, let us bring up our panelists.

29
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:20,500

43
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, I would love to hear a little bit more about Each of you and particularly how you're white you're responsible for today.

44
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,200
The main topic is how we're leading are distributed.

45
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,900
Workforce has.

46
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,800
So give us a penis.

47
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,100
A little picture of the teens that you're leading.

48
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,800
How are these structured regionally, you know, feel free to share?

49
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,400
And I, let us start with you to Mika, and we will go around.

50
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,000
Hi.

51
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
Good afternoon everyone.

52
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,600
My name is Tamika Smith, and the CEO of the Virginia Community Health Plan at you.

53
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,600
Knighted Healthcare.

54
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,700
I have a span of control of 300 employees.

55
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,700
I like to call them teammates and our team members.

56
00:08:48,400 --> 00:09:02,000
Most of those individuals are clinicians and their job is to serve and help support to navigate this complex Healthcare System for the members that we have in our, in our program.

57
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:16,300
We currently have and serve nearly 300,000 members and so a lot of our members Burgers are all of our members are on Medicaid or there, or they qualify for Medicare meaning their dual eligible.

58
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:27,900
And what that means is these are people that are often marginalized in our communities, are underserved and may even suffer from the social determinants of health.

59
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,200
And these are things that prevent an individual from achieving their highest health potential in a lifetime.

60
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,600
And so we serve those people on a day-to-day.

61
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,700
Aces and I have to do it across the entire state of Virginia.

62
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,900
And there are six regions within the Commonwealth of Virginia that we do that through.

63
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,800
And so, having a distributed Workforce is real.

64
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,300
I live and breathe it every day.

65
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:05,400
And so, happy to be here to talk to you about what we see in our business, on a day-to-day basis, and how complex it is, and how we're trying to unravel that.

66
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,800
Thank you, Tomika.

67
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,300
I am headed over to you, Roberto.

68
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,800

So Bienvenidos, we, you know, we're fast growing company serving.

71
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:36,400
Helping distributed Workforce has been more connected, and so we're serving customers across the gamut of, you know, tech companies to financial institute's and everything in between really helping them connect their employees like never before.

72
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:47,600
And I am glad to be part of this conversation because I distributed Workforce add layers of complex complexity, right to leaders to peers to, how are you in pathetic?

73
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,700
How do you really understand all the complexities that this new way of work?

74
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,500

75
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:00,100
But yeah, I am here for we're distributed team across the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.

76
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:06,300
So every time zone is a juggling act setting meetings and such but it's a fun time.

77
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,600
I am so glad to be here.

78
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,800
Thanks, Rob.

79
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,100
Heading over to you, London.

80
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,300
Hi everyone.

81
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,000
My name is London.

82
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,400
Lomax.

83
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,400
I am a chief strategic advisor for Aetna.

84
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,500
A CVS Health company, and I am excited to be here today as well.

85
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,300
You know, our goal is to be a, you know, every moment of Health, for all of our members.

86
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,200
We serve about 24 million members across the country in the United States.

87
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:41,400
So, you know, all over the place and to the point of Roberto and Tamika distributed Workforce is essential in, making sure that We can service our members and ultimately a happy.

88
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,500
And engaged Workforce is the best for our members as well.

89
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,300
Awesome.

90
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,000
All right, so jumping into our first question.

91
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,200
What does empathy mean to you?

92
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Let us just start with that.

93
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,700
What is empathy mean to you?

94
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,600
And then you can go into.

95
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,100
How are you thinking about empathy with your teams?

96
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,400
Well, the first starting you kick us off.

97
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,100
Hey, hey, there to hear what you have to say potato here.

98
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,600
I am good.

99
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,200
I am good with it.

100
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
So high level, you know, it was funny.

101
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,000
I was having this conversation.

102
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,800
First of all, I will be the first one to admit.

103
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
I am not an expert at empathetic leader thing.

104
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,000
I think it's a, we're learning every day.

105
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,900
We learn as we grow, but it's really.

106
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,100
I had a conversation about this couple weeks ago.

107
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:40,500
Somebody was asking, hey, what's the difference between being sympathetic and empathetic and You know, being sympathetic is, I feel sorry for this person, right?

108
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:51,500
That's like the Cleavers definition of that being empathetic is, I can relate to that person, but being able to authentically, say you can relate to that person is being able to put yourselves in their shoes.

109
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,900
Which requires you to slow down, pause a second and go there and say, you know what?

110
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:05,600
I hired a rockstar single mom, and she's working for us, and she's a single mom of two if I am empathetic to her.

111
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:21,500
That means that I am politically trying to place myself in her shoes managing the schedules that we have managing the demands of a customer managing the time zones and then asking myself, how do we make sure that we enable her to thrive in those circumstances?

112
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,600
And I think that's, it was tration of being empathetic is saying, you know what?

113
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,200
Let us pause.

114
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,100
Let us understand this scenario, this person, the complexities of their circumstances.

115
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
And then, how do we make decisions based on that?

116
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,500
That's a high level.

117
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,100
Perspective on my site on being empathetic.

118
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,100
Love that.

119
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:49,100
I mean, I would Echo that and just say for me it means, you know, having a true understanding or ability to understand people at a human level.

120
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:49,900
Right?

121
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:58,200
And I think what that yields are an element of respect for the lives of the people that you're working with and the things that they're going through.

122
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,300
So I will snap onto what they did, what they both said.

123
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:18,800
So I will first say what they said to think that they put it, put it very well, but I also to would add that all the more reason why it's important for us to appreciate the differences, amongst all of us in amongst all the people that are on the team, right?

124
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,000
We are walking a very different shoes.

125
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,400
One woman is not the same as the same woman as a next one.

126
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,700
Man is not the same man as a next right?

127
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,000
You may have a father that is a single father.

128
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,500
Could be how he could have adopted children?

129
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,100
He get a foster kid.

130
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,400
He could be a widower, right?

131
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:55,000
And so you got to take time to understand your staff, your teammates and then be sensitive to the difference that they bring to work every day and the difference in their Lifestyles and what's going on in their individual circumstances and the other.

132
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,900
The other thing I would say about it is The one thing that we can count on in life is change, right?

133
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:11,900
And so, we're all going to go through changes in our lifetime that require us to behave differently to function differently to cope differently.

134
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:18,600
And so, I think being an empathetic leader, we have to take that into consideration that we can expect someone to deliver.

135
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,000
A hundred percent of the time because we're human and things are going to happen.

136
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:31,900
And so having empathy to Roberto's point in like, walking in someone's shoes and understanding what they're going through.

137
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,900
And to London's point being human about, it gives us an opportunity to say.

138
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,200
Okay.

139
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,700
Listen, I am going to provide this individual with Grace at a certain point in time and it may be forever.

140
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,300
You may need to adjust a work schedule.

141
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:53,500
They need to do something different, but the end of the day, if you're treating For who they are individually, it matters and it makes a difference.

142
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,100
So good rich.

143
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,300
I was like tweetable is quotables right there from all of you.

144
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Thank you for sharing.

145
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:09,300
So you know what you think about empathy with your distributed team in particular?

146
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:18,000
How do you balance being empathetic but also driving for results and maintaining high performance?

147
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
They have sort of feel like they could conflict.

148
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Yeah, that's a great point.

149
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,700
And I think I have we have talked about this before is empathy and results are not mutually exclusive, right?

150
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,900
You can be empathy forward and results driven at the same time.

151
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:40,200
I think the misconception historically, has been that you have to have the care to the stick and often, you got that, right?

152
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:51,900
You got to drive those results and in a way, that's not empathetic, but I think as we have seen, not just through the pandemic, but over time even generationally, it's becoming more and more important to understand.

153
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:58,700
People understand what drives them and what inspires them and what gets you result, while also being human.

154
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,300
And I think, you know, that's something that I constantly work on.

155
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:19,900
I know to make it as an owner for a long time, and I am sure, you know, the welcome team does as well, but it's really important to understand that, you know, you can have both, Absolutely, that's 100%.

156
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:35,300
I think one of the things that, if you rewind years ago, I think people will look at empathetic leadership as a soft skill and not a performance indicator, and it's completely, like, in recent years.

157
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:41,100
It's become so much more evident that empathetic leadership drives the best result possible.

158
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:53,000
And I think in the question being for the distributed Workforce, I think that it's, it's become such a necessity more than anything else for us, and we distributed teams.

159
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:03,400
Well, I think that at a high level, when you look at initial studies out there, that show sympathetic leadership, just least it's a better results in better performance.

160
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:14,100
And I think at the heart of It, kind of humanizing that a second, I was talking to a mentor while back, and she said, hey, you know what?

161
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,900
Every time I on board a new employee.

162
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,700
The first question, I asked that person is what's the most important thing to you outside of work?

163
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,300
And what are you trying to accomplish outside of work?

164
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Because we hired you, we're going to go, we're going to go work.

165
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,700
We're going to go up field.

166
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,800
We're going to get into battle together, but then go chase a number but for you and this season, what's the most important thing?

167
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:43,400
And I think that just starts to establish the foundations that can lead to more empathetic leadership.

168
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,700
All right.

169
00:18:43,700 --> 00:19:01,600
So for instance, this person says, you know what the most important thing in this season right now is my kids recital and actually, Has practice every time at 9 AM On Friday is the most important to think, for me this season, because she'd been working really hard and I want her to be excellent at that.

170
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,400
So now it's a leader and as a manager.

171
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:11,100
Now, you know, by just asking that question that 9:00 in the morning is off limits for Samantha who lives in Georgia.

172
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,800
Because that's the most important thing for her.

173
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:20,700
Now, just one simple question, allows you to be sympathetic to an employee in a very material way because that's the most important thing for her.

174
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,800
And that's even right.

175
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,700
And I think that At us in a distributed Workforce.

176
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:32,900
We just have to lean in a little bit harder Than Leaders to understand what are those opportunities for us to fill the Gap right?

177
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:40,400
As leaders and make sure that person pride and when we do that, I think performance of six Carousels because if you take care of your people, they're going to date.

178
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,100
They owe it to you.

179
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,500
They like, you know what you look out for me.

180
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:59,200
I am going to look out for you and this company, and I am here for I mean, I couldn't, I couldn't agree more with that, and I think, companies, and, or leaders that lead without empathetic leadership will suffer at the end of the day.

181
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
And I think if they're, if they're doing it now, they're suffering.

182
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:13,300
Now if they continue to do what they will suffer, even more in the future, you know, one of the things that we do on my leadership team and then it's been cascaded, right?

183
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,200
But one of the things that we do to make sure that we're double-clicking on, Knowing each other.

184
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:28,100
So we first subscribe, I something like to call first team, and our for our first commitment is to our first team and that's our executive leadership team.

185
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:39,000
And the reason being is you think about being on a national sports team, you're throwing the ball that team, not the team that sitting behind that, the second team gets the first team, right?

186
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,200
So you have got it, you have to have a commitment to one another.

187
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,600
There.

188
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,900
That's the first thing.

189
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
The second thing is, we commit.

190
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:55,600
So we spend 90 minutes together as a — leadership team every single week, and we reserve 20 minutes of that 90 minutes every single week to do, what we call a check in.

191
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,700
Now, some might be what as a mental health check in.

192
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:11,100
I kind of view it as that, but it's also to a check in to understand where people are in their station and place in life At that moment in that week because it does change day to day and it changes by week to week.

193
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,600
And so we asked you question and I got this from another leader.

194
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,400
This is not Tamika Smith.

195
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:24,200
I actually stole it from a person that I reported to, but it was so fascinating to me and how well he was able to build a strong team.

196
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,100
But as two questions and the questions are, what is your energy for the job?

197
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
And what's your stress?

198
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,300
Your level of stress, be it outside or inside, right?

199
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,600
Because the fact of the matter is, there are polarities in life, right?

200
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,300
What goes up must come down, right?

201
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,500
You pull, you pull one thing this way something, it's cooled and another Direction.

202
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,900
And so and that's on a scale of Loved one to ten energy for the job.

203
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:59,600
If someone writes it on a nine, but they're outside, stress is a 1, they're doing great, but great and their will, if they're willing to share why that week is going so great.

204
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:09,900
We are all happier to hear those stories because we want to share in the joy, but then there are opportunities are times and opportunities where someone will share that their energy for the job is a five.

205
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,600
And they're outside stresses and nine.

206
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,900
And that happened this past week.

207
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,700
We had someone on my leadership team who had a friend pass away.

208
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,600
34 years old suddenly, they weren't expecting it.

209
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,700
So you think about that?

210
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,900
What my team was able to do is to back off, right?

211
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:36,000
The things that we were asking for in the things that we thought are important At that moment that week is not important to him or weren't important to him in that week.

212
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,000
And so we backed off we let him have a space.

213
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:45,900
We let him die a lot of meetings early if you needed to or take a half of a day, the During that week because that was traumatic for him.

214
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,100
Yes, business.

215
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,400
Still needs to get done.

216
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,500
But he's an important member of our clan, and we recognize that.

217
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,100
And so it gives us an opportunity to be empathetic as an entire leadership team.

218
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:13,500
And so, what I am starting to see now is that are my leaders are doing that for their teams and then their managers are doing that for their teams, and we are becoming a more empathetic organization within just, the Virginia health plan.

219
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,700
Yeah, it's because I think that's important that you mentioned.

220
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,900
That just around the influence of the teams.

221
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,100
It starts with the leadership, right?

222
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:42,700
It starts the top starts with making conscious efforts to, to infuse empathy into the culture of the team and finding unique ways that to do that in ways that are, you know, feasible for your team, whether it's 90 minutes, whether it's 30, whether its individual check-ins, but prioritizing it as part of your leadership imperatives.

223
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,600
I It is absolutely crucial when you think about trying to inspire your people.

224
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,400
You're not and I just have to say this one last thing here we have to care about our people just as much as we care about our profits.

225
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,100
And when you do that, you're going to see profits rise, you have to care that much.

226
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,300
We spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to make more money how to make the process work.

227
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:18,100
We need to spend equal amount of time, trying to figure out how to keep our people happy and productive, and to make sure that they are right?

228
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,700
Because if they're right, the business will be right.

229
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,500
Yeah.

230
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,600
Powerful and the Tactical questions that can be asked.

231
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,500
I think I jotted it down and chat.

232
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:32,900
There.

233
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,500
What is your energy for the job?

234
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,100
What is your level of stress?

235
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,800
Those are some really good questions and you do it on a scale of one to ten random.

236
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,700
Got it.

237
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,500
That's great.

238
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
Wow, thank you for sharing all of that.

239
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,900
We got a bunch of questions that are getting a pop up in Q&A.

240
00:24:51,900 --> 00:25:01,700
I have one more question before we Jump over to Q&A, how has the pandemic changed your approach to empathetic leadership?

241
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:19,900
I think it's made as double-click on it, right for me at least because we you know, you here, you see the all these ads and all these right inputs, asking you to check in on your friends and family.

242
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,300
It's a mystery for work, right?

243
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:35,400
You have got to check in on people because you don't know what people are going through at times unless you ask and, and we have got to get out of the habit of and maybe we're already out of the habit of asking people how they're doing, but not actually stopping to listen to how they Do.

244
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,800
And to me, it's one of my biggest pet peeves, is someone will say how you do.

245
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,400
And before I can even finish their, like, asking me another question.

246
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,100
Like, did you care?

247
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:52,500
What if, what if I told you I wasn't doing so well, were you prepared to pause and listen to that?

248
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,800
And so, you know, I know we're going to talk about, we will probably get into this a little bit later.

249
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,700
But like, I miss being in the office for that.

250
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,800
Very reason, I really do.

251
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:11,100
I miss the water cooler conversations or the elevator comes Station or the, we're getting ready to leave the office conversation and oh, by the way, do you want to catch a drink Gina and London?

252
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,100
And I did that a lot this pencil.

253
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,300
We had it when we work together.

254
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,500
We had a really good time.

255
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:15,800
At least.

256
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,600
I think we did.

257
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,500
We had a great time, and we became more friends than we were co-workers.

258
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:32,100
I still talk to them on a regular, pretty consistent basis, and we check in with each other's families, but that's because of the team that we have in the relationship that we both with one another.

259
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Yeah, you haven't.

260
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,700
Had to make a, I think there's a difference in hearing versus listening, right?

261
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:48,200
And, and truly, making sure someone feels heard and taking that active effort to understand what someone is feeling and what they're going through often.

262
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,200
I have found that's more important than the work because the work is going to have to get done, right?

263
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,400
We're gonna all continue to drive the prophets, the process, the operations.

264
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:04,700
Otherwise, none of us will be in our positions on our roles in our companies or whatever, but I think what's cements the connection.

265
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
The Bomb the Loyalty.

266
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:14,500
The inspiration is taking that time and making it a part of your process to check on your people to follow through and I think that's another piece, right?

267
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:20,200
As it's one thing to pick up the phone and say or walk see somebody walking down the hall or on a meeting to how's your day?

268
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:28,800
And then I will after you talked about five minutes, all those great to hear and then you don't talk to me again about anything about themselves for six months or three months later.

269
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,700
I am right.

270
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,500
So, really making that concerted, concerted effort, and, you know, I will say that.

271
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,500
What we don't think about, as it relates to that, is that often, that's hard, right?

272
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:53,500
Sometimes it's hard to get out of your, your go, go, you know, Roadrunner focus and work or lives to stop and engage deeply with someone else and or multiple people or multiple folks on your team.

273
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:00,200
So, so you ask the original question of how, you know, has a pandemic influenced, my leadership style around that.

274
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,800
I have made it a priority to put time on my calendar, every week to check on.

275
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,400
A couple of people and they may be different.

276
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
It may be an email.

277
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
It may be 15 minutes, Hutch point.

278
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:19,000
But really making that part of the calendar, just like you do your workouts, just like you do your meditation or your, you know, your QB ours or sprs.

279
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,800
You got to put up a part of your calendar says, check on your people this week.

280
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,100
It's going to be X y&z or this area or these five.

281
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:34,400
I think that's really important and it goes a long way for the culture of your team and building a true empathetic culture.

282
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,700
Check on your people.

283
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I have to say, I have been something, I have been something.

284
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,600
I think two things, one, you know, to be curious.

285
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,400
I might like came first and your Frontline leaders.

286
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,800
I think I want to touch on that.

287
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,300
And then, second on making time.

288
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:57,500
They both of you guys have, clearly articulated are the importance of actually caring and making time.

289
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:16,200
And not just like the check the box, how you do a response on the management for I think that, you know, for us to have the opportunity to read readers, I think leaders in the season need a little bit more double-clicking and check ins than we typically.

290
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:23,400
I think our Frontline leaders are typically the ones that carry the weight of the company, but also carry the weight of your vehicle at the same time.

291
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:29,400
All right, so it's like not only do you hear all the needs of the business but you also hear the needs of your people.

292
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,600
And the question is, who's checking on you and that's become very clear to me as a leader in my core.

293
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:45,000
Team is like, how is My core team doing because Vex I think love that you said this, if they're not doing well, nothing, nothing else matters because they're going to be the leaders that are meeting 14th.

294
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,600
Right?

295
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,900
I think that's become really clear to me.

296
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:54,600
And then I think the second thing on how has it changed with remote image or distributed.

297
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,300
I think it's just we're not bumping into each other to make it like you said, right?

298
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,200
We're not seeing that person that's checked out, or we're not seeing that person.

299
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
That feels down.

300
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,000
You're not picking up on the body language.

301
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,100
No.

302
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:24,700
So that means that we have to be almost like so in tune with like how people are showing up on slack on an email, one word that they said that was maybe out of character or there's a lot that goes into like that level of communication.

303
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,700
The question is as leaders.

304
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,800
Are we going to make Tom?

305
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,200
I am just this happened to me very recently, an employee's hear something.

306
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,100
And I was traveling, and I was in the Bay Area and my calendar stacked.

307
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,000
And I am like, you know what, this is a very important conversation and Instead of jumping on a quick 5-minute call.

308
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:49,100
I am a punt this to like a week and a half later where I know there's going to be a window for an unlimited window of time.

309
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,200
And the question becomes, how am I going to clear?

310
00:30:52,200 --> 00:31:00,600
My calendar for 23 hours, whatever it is to really listen to a key player on your team so that you can answer questions.

311
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,900
So you can dig into the layers of complexities that a person might be going through and make space.

312
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,600
And I think that's crazy talk.

313
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:18,000
When you're a busy CEO and the leader and say hold on, you're going to block out that time and I think that's the level of attention we have to do, especially in a remote world to say, you know what?

314
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,600
Yes, the ten minute.

315
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,100
All is not going to be enough.

316
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:26,800
I have to clear my calendar at a certain point, but I'ma give you the space in the time, so we can dig in together.

317
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,500
And I think that's something that I am learning as a leader of distributed Workforce is the intention that comes with making space and checking in on your people.

318
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,900
Yeah, and I can, I just add one thing is when you mentioned leaders, here's what I would also add.

319
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,500
This is a plug for me you and London like so check on your leaders.

320
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,500
Yeah.

321
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,100
Yes.

322
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,600
People check on your leader.

323
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:04,700
Like it is rather Lonely at the Top and the you don't have a lot of people within your organization checking on you white there.

324
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,400
Assume that you got it right there.

325
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:12,000
Assuming that you're at the wheel, you got it, but when someone does call, it's kind of, its kind of weird.

326
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,200
You have to like, adjust your thoughts, your license, ask how you're doing.

327
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,300
You're like, okay, but that's how Also to build rapport and you build relationship, right?

328
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,400
Not a lot of people are checking on us.

329
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,100
Yeah, it goes back to this analogy.

330
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:35,000
If you're driving the bus or driving the ship and you're the captain, right and you're driving all day, all night, who's coming to the front, it to say, how are you doing?

331
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,500
Or can you take can we do something for you?

332
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:47,300
I think you touched on it, you know, around this idea of paying attention, and I am an expressive texture and Communicator often.

333
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,400
I use a lot of emojis for that very reason.

334
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,900
I really do believe in it, you know, some always send a smiley face or thumbs up or something funny.

335
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So most people know how I am feeling or know that I am engaged when you get a one word text for me or you get, you know, a very short response either.

336
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,400
I am super busy or not in it, right?

337
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:22,100
You gotta pay attention to those little things to your point around emails and communication, and then also respecting other people's Styles and it goes back to as a leader, just being in tuned and making that a priority.

338
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,600
Such Rich nuggets shared by you all.

339
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Wow, it's almost like every Emoji, every response.

340
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
There could be a double-click, you know, into that.

341
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,700
And Roberto is Infamous for the double-click, you know, which is awesome and needed in this time.

342
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:58,300
And, so I think as Leaders we could be mindful of like, okay, wait, you know, know the norms and habits of each of your employees and if something's a little off, like, they're not, but not that, The Emoji like they normally do, or they're not responding with a thumbs up.

343
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,600
Let me double-click into that.

344
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,000
What's going on there?

345
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,300
You know, I think that's really important and it goes both ways.

346
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,900
It's not only managers to their direct reports.

347
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,600
But management.

348
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,100
Let us do that for our leaders.

349
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:13,199
Let us check in with our bosses.

350
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,600
All right.

351
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,000
Well, we have got a ton of great questions that are coming through.

352
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,400
So we're going to go through them and try to answer as many as we can.

353
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,000
And there are many times the highwomen Highest upvotes.

354
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,400
We have is with this first question.

355
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:35,000
How do you get a male-dominated leadership team to see the value of empathetic leadership?

356
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:44,800
And I think we have to be mindful of any gender dominated leadership because it could be a full female-dominated leadership team.

357
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,699
It could be a full male, right?

358
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:53,500
I think just knowing that when you have that kind of, you know, majority group.

359
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,600
Are we being Mindful and empathetic in our leadership?

360
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,900
Do you want to take that one?

361
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,100
Tamika, hey, I will go for it.

362
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:22,800
Well, you know, so the question, the way it was, it was originally proposed or posed made the assumption that men aren't as empathetic and maybe there's some truth in that, it has not been my experience.

363
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:30,900
For me, I do know that there are some people in general that just aren't empathetic and part of that too.

364
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,700
I don't, you know, I don't know if that's nature-nurture.

365
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,900
Like, are you born with it?

366
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,800
I don't know, but I think that's a debate that should be it.

367
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,200
That's it.

368
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,000
That's debatable in the topic in and of itself, but it hasn't, it hasn't been my experience for me.

369
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,700
I have tended to surround myself with and be surrounded by people that genuinely care about me as an individual.

370
00:35:53,700 --> 00:36:00,300
And when they don't I kind of step out because I can see the soup how superficial relationship is.

371
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:07,800
I have right now the best boss I have ever had and my life, and he's amazing.

372
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
He takes time.

373
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,800
He knows when to call me.

374
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,300
He allows me to say, exactly what's on my mind.

375
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,400
Even if it is not the right thing to say at the time.

376
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,400
And so, but you need that space to be able to do that.

377
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:36,900
And, so I, you know, I think you got to surround yourself and you got to know when to went to move on to because some of us think that we have got to stay on a team, got to take what's dished out and you don't you have choices in life.

378
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,200
You choose every single day, you're going to brush your teeth.

379
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,200
If you're gonna put one foot in front of the other you make choices.

380
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:51,000
And if you're on a team where you're not feeling that you're getting what you need you have an opportunity to leave that team.

381
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,300
Go somewhere else.

382
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:58,300
Take Your gifts elsewhere because sometimes it might, it might not be the place or the space for you.

383
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,900
And that's okay.

384
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,700
It's okay that it's not the end of the world when it doesn't work out.

385
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,500
It's good.

386
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,200
It's good.

387
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,300
I think, I think this is a, it's a I mean, powerful question, right?

388
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:20,500
I think there's a lot of layers in this question as well, and we can parse have an entire session with a much more qualified panel than me being on here.

389
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,800
But I think I need to get a high level.

390
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,600
I think, at a high level, it's me.

391
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,300
It's just speak to at the core of it is also diversity.

392
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:29,800
Right?

393
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:36,800
I think that if we're not talking about that as it relates to Teams and team build outs.

394
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,200
Then.

395
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,600
I think there's going to be an imbalance of perspectives.

396
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,700
And so, regardless of male Dominator or not.

397
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:48,200
I think it's also how the versus the thinking a representation of that team and that company.

398
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,100
And how does that then drive empathetic leadership?

399
00:37:52,200 --> 00:38:05,200
And I think, I mean, when I, when I think about like, you know, one of my mentors has this core concept that you she's he's always, I don't have his first term is I got my mentors that are women powerful women, which is awesome.

400
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:16,200
But he's an investor, and she says, you know what, I want to hear your distance, traveled story, which really is like regardless of, what your resume say, or you always have what school you went to.

401
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,500
I want to hear your story, your life Journey.

402
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,000
Have you been through some hard times?

403
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:33,600
My tell me about the hard times you have been in and I think like having a team that naturally has been through some hard times and a crazy distance travel story just leads to just having more empathetic leadership as well because you had the fight.

404
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,700
You have to like climb walls and Hunker down, you had to overcome some things in life.

405
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,000
And I think that should build you to be a bit more empathetic as well.

406
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,500
Roberta.

407
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,300
So, if though, that if, and I am thinking about this in my head and out loud right now, so, we're in the moment.

408
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:57,500
But I also wonder if authenticity could be a catalyst for empathy, right?

409
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:03,900
Because the more authentic, I have been bringing my whole self to work whether people like it or not.

410
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,400
Like this is who I am.

411
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,800
And, you know, not a lot of going to change at this point.

412
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,500
I mean, I am I can work on it, but I am who I am and my core.

413
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:19,700
Bringing my whole self to work, has paid more dividends for me than anything else.

414
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:30,300
And I think it's given people the license or the opportunity to care about me as an individual because they know about me as a person, right?

415
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:38,600
So, I used to be afraid to tell people that I started out my career while I was on Medicaid, a mother on Medicaid, right?

416
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,700
And now I am leading Medicaid.

417
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,700
I should share that.

418
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,300
Story.

419
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:49,300
And now I am sharing that story and people are seeing themselves in me.

420
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:56,000
And so now, right when I have an issue, when I talk to them about, what's going on with my family and some of these stories are unbelievable people.

421
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,600
Can they can identify with that?

422
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:06,700
And, so I think that authenticity can be a path to yeah, opening up that.

423
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,100
Absolutely no one.

424
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,100
I mean and you can we can talk about this.

425
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:17,100
I mean, I know we probably need to and But we have tried getting to Q&A but at a high level to make a I would say authenticity.

426
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:21,500
And just I think Aaron with that is with the given as Alpha born ability, right?

427
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,600
As Leaders bought a time.

428
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,300
We think that run ability is a weakness that the okay.

429
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:32,400
Yeah, that Us opening up and say, you know what, I have had a hard for, you know what, I am going through some crap in Life or you know what?

430
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,100
I don't know the answer to that, and I am going to be vulnerable.

431
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,600
I don't know the answer to that, but we're going to go figure it out.

432
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,600
In fact, we have the team to go figure that up and I think just being more vulnerable.

433
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:48,400
All also just allowed level of authenticity across teams that just makes you more human at the end of the day.

434
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
And I think that's what we're talking about here.

435
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,200
So I will double-click I am above you said because I think you guys you to hit that nail on the head.

436
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:07,500
And I think it goes back to this underlying kind of layer of the onion around the capacity for authenticity organizations of people that value authenticity, right?

437
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,700
And when you think about this idea that we have all been a part of organizations for a significant.

438
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:34,100
Of our time of our lives and time whether it's businesses, family, schools, social groups, and then when you're thinking about this idea of empathy, with in all of that, it comes down to, you know, language context culture, and having the want to understand it and end-to-end to Value it.

439
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:42,700
And to your point a second ago, your life Journey or your life travel and then Tomika bringing you're bringing your full and authentic self to the job you're in.

440
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:48,300
And people being able, not only to recognize that, see the value, and then bringing more of that.

441
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:59,300
And, and I think as Leaders, we owe it to our teams and our organizations to build that out and to continue to build that perspective and thought leadership and diversity.

442
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:12,700
And that, and you get into this up, this bigger concept of diversity, equity and inclusion, and he's thinking sympathies at the core, and I am seeing a lot of this, these themes across organizations across Industries.

443
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,300
And the importance of it.

444
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:21,500
The bigger we get as a world in a country and, you know, so on and it's important, right?

445
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,600
It's so important.

446
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,800
Well, you know, before we leave this, I do think we should talk about trust.

447
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,600
So I think important equation, right?

448
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,200
I think trust is huge.

449
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,700
Right and without it, you have nothing, right?

450
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,700
And it's in a marriage friendship or relationship with your boss, right?

451
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,900
With your customers, where people don't trust, you can't get very far.

452
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,400
And, so I think that there's a connection with empathy and Trust.

453
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:53,100
I like to take my teens through happiness training with an expert Rick Fox.

454
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:53,600
It's a wreck.

455
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,100
If you're out there.

456
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:54,800
I hope you're listening.

457
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,400
Love him.

458
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,600
Love his approach.

459
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,600
But he gave, he gives us when we go through this training, a trust formula, right?

460
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:11,700
And that trust formula is high levels of interaction, high levels of flexibility and high levels of disclosure.

461
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:20,800
And you think about that, any relationship that you value has those three components or ingredients in it, right?

462
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,100
You think about the bigger your closest friend, your wife?

463
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,100
Wife, your husband, your right, your parents, your brothers and sisters.

464
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,000
Those that you're closest to, you are flexible.

465
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
They know things about you that other people don't know.

466
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,500
And you spend a lot of time with them because you choose to.

467
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,900
And, so I think that trust and empathy are connected in that way in that vein.

468
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,400
And so when you put those things together, right?

469
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,900
Actually we might be building something around empathy, but it's like authenticity.

470
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,300
It's trust right?

471
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,100
You and You miss all those things together.

472
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,500
And I think empathy then comes along for the ride.

473
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,100
You say interaction, flexibility and disclosure.

474
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:09,300
What were the three high levels of flexibility high levels of Engagement and high levels of disclosure?

475
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,600
Equals trust awesome Mica.

476
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,100
I need to get this happiness training ASAP.

477
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:22,100
So we're going to have your friend is going to have a referral coming in really soon, because I need that in my life.

478
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,400
I think.

479
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,800
I think it's brilliant, especially again, tying it back to remote and distributed teams.

480
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:37,000
It's like, I think, you know, you're mentioning happiness training and for some people that vote on that sounds like from Mars somewhere, but no, it's like in this distributed world.

481
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,100
The intentionality just have to be so much more.

482
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,100
And water and having teams go through intentional, training on how to do this.

483
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,600
Well, especially when both teams.

484
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,000
It's fascinating.

485
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,400
So I guess we're talking The Green Room, so we can talk about that referral.

486
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:59,200
But before we go, next question, so you take, you take that trust for me line, you take all the depth that we just talked about.

487
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
Now you go say to me, go create a PowerPoint.

488
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:09,800
Now, you say now you say to your team, go get prepared for some business review, or go get prepared for something that in the grand scheme of what it is.

489
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,100
You're trying.

490
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:10,900
To accomplish.

491
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:22,200
Is it, is that big you'd be amazed how much you get done together when you build, you know, those High degrees of, trust disclosure partnership and understanding of each other.

492
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,600
When, when now the ask is, how can you lean in with me?

493
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,400
Can we do this together?

494
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,700
I am are you ready?

495
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,200
What support do you need that?

496
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,900
It's something fascinating when you get to that threshold and over that Hill.

497
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:50,800
And Roberto London can tell you, he's been through the training and it was, I mean, it's an experience and you can't unknow what you learn when you go to that, that did that programming that try that process.

498
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,400
You can't, you can't unknow it.

499
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,600
And so you're wet with it and you have to apply it because it's in your head.

500
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,400
So, that's the happiness training with Rick Foster.

501
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:11,000
Okay, and I mean, there is a question here in chat about leadership exercises to help improve empathy.

502
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,900
So would you take your whole leadership team?

503
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,000
Unlike an off-site?

504
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,200
And is this, like a whole day activity, or it's a two-day the way Rick does it?

505
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:27,700
It's a two-day investment in your leadership team, and he really talks to you about the realities and the science of what happy.

506
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:28,500
People do.

507
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,000
And so happy people behave and they do certain things.

508
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,800
There are certain things that they do in life because they're happy.

509
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:53,200
And then there's also two when your, when your team is happy, they are functioning from the executive level of their brain, which means that's the highest place of productivity, you can get from that team because they're high functioning there are high functioning teams.

510
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,700
And so as you think about, you think about that executive function, that's where we want.

511
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,200
Our people to be leading from is that executive function of their brain?

512
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,400
And then when you do that, there's these other components of Happiness, like, showing appreciation.

513
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:08,900
I mean, you got to think about it.

514
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,400
How often do you tell someone?

515
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:19,200
I really appreciate it, but you did for me or I appreciate you, staying late on that meeting, or appreciate you stand up to 2:00 in the morning to work on that deck, whatever it is.

516
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,700
But it's you got to show real appreciation for people, and they have to feel it here.

517
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,600
It can't be superficial but that's something that You people do is they show appreciation.

518
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,300
They show humility.

519
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,600
They focus around intention rights.

520
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:44,100
If you think about when people harm you, you got to ask yourself the question about that individuals intention, right?

521
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:48,800
And so, you can forgive people if their intention wasn't to harm you.

522
00:47:49,600 --> 00:48:16,700
Now, if their intention was to harm you, that is a whole nother ball of wax dealing with something totally different, but he takes us, he will take your Teams through all of that exercise, to help, you understand what happy people do, how they function, how they engage and whatnot, and how to recognize when you have or likely might have someone on your team, that is intentionally causing people harm because hurt, people hurt people.

523
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,800
Mmm, so good.

524
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,600
All right, let us talk to you before.

525
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,500
Before we leave this.

526
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,900
We're going to have, like, happiness workshop on.

527
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,900
Welcome for Distributing.

528
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,300
Yeah.

529
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,300
Like that's like the next event.

530
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:37,800
We have to get going, love that and I think somebody in chat was asking, you know, is there a happiness index or test that we can take?

531
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,800
We're going.

532
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,700
We're going to do it on a walk on, so we can do it all together.

533
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,200
Okay?

534
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:42,700
Yeah.

535
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Well Rick Foster on, I love it.

536
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,000
Alright, here's another question.

537
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:53,200
How do you scale empathetic leadership as your team and as your company grows?

538
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,400
I think you.

539
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,200
You stay true.

540
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:58,800
The formula.

541
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:06,700
Whatever that formula is for your team, right in the end, wherever you have seen that most success and obviously, you know, to make is mentioning the happiness formula.

542
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,200
I am sure there're others, you know, that have worked specific to Industries or what it is.

543
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,200
You're trying to accomplish as you scale.

544
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:21,500
Not only do you have to make sure that you're staying true to that formula, but you are evolving it over time for scalability, right?

545
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:26,400
Whether that's more resources or that's more in time that you use dedicated to it.

546
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:37,700
When you go from A Thousand person company or 500 person company to have 50,000 person company, you will notice the infrastructure around people and the infrastructure around programs and diversity, inclusion.

547
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,500
Just simple networking or teaching gross, right?

548
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:50,500
It's no longer one person to maybe five, maybe ten, maybe different groups and organizations and then you create the Matrix around that.

549
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:57,300
But I would say, you know, from my experiences, you know, scaling that empathy empathetic culture and Leadership.

550
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,500
Aisle and, you know, kind of anchor, you got it State Route.

551
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,400
It has to be a priority, has to be measured.

552
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,300
It has to be a priority.

553
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:04,500
Right?

554
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,300
What's measured gets done and it gets done.

555
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:07,700
Well.

556
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:10,800
Good point.

557
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:17,000
I think for me I go back to interviewing like when your interview especially like a leader in your organization.

558
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:26,200
Your leaders can be responsible for people and so having the wrong higher that's coming in and is responsible for driving culture and building people up.

559
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,200
I mean, it's become so much more important, right?

560
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:39,300
So, the interviewing process that you have, I think Linda back to your point that interviewing formula is making sure that you don't lower the bar.

561
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:44,100
You're very people consider company and what you're bringing company, people consider the company for.

562
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,100
I think a lot of times we get into these pressure pocket.

563
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,500
Sometimes we were just, I just need someone to come in and kind of.

564
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,800
Yes, they check all the boxes on the resume, they do all of this.

565
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,700
But how are you actually double-clicking to kind of hammer that one home on the person?

566
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,400
Can I really trust this person to lead people?

567
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:12,600
Well, and I just hold my leader so a higher bar because at the end, Of the day, they're the ones building culture with their teams.

568
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:12,800
Right?

569
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,900
So I am only a successful as I am able to influence my reader.

570
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And so bringing the Right leader in and carry that culture further is, I think we're starts again at let me touch on that as well.

571
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,100
None of this is easy.

572
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,100
Right?

573
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,300
Well, let us be clear, right?

574
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:42,900
None of this, this thinking and these approaches, and the framework is easy, and it gets harder, especially the bigger you get, and the more diverse you get as an organization, and I am a firm believer in.

575
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:50,000
Not one size, fits all and I think that's one of the biggest challenges that we have as big companies and, you know, different Industries.

576
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,800
We try to take these Frameworks at ideas and Concepts and just layer it on and do this.

577
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:07,200
You have to find the Formula that works for your team, your direct team, and your broader organization, and you have to solicit the inspiration and to buy into it.

578
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:13,200
So I will just I will leave that because I don't want people to think that we're just saying this and it's, you know, snap of a finger.

579
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,500
But this takes work.

580
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,600
It takes alignment.

581
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,200
It takes time.

582
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:23,000
It takes energy takes measurement takes investment, and it's important to think about it holistically in that way.

583
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,300
I agree.

584
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:25,900
You know what?

585
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,100
I think it's around.

586
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,500
I think it's around intention.

587
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,400
Right?

588
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:40,900
And so for people that have children, you will this will resonate our kids do as we do not necessarily as we say, right?

589
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,800
And sometimes kids are like, huh?

590
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:44,800
That's me.

591
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,000
That is me off every day.

592
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,300
And it's interesting.

593
00:52:49,300 --> 00:53:02,200
They do more of what you do than what you say because and most times We're saying things, we have to say it a thousand times, but when you're doing something right, that's easier to adopt because it becomes habit.

594
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:11,600
And, so I think it's around and tension and around making sure that you were modeling the way and calling it out when you don't see it because that's important too, right?

595
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,900
Sometimes we, you know, people do something wrong or something terrible and will whisper behind the scenes.

596
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,900
Like did you believe did you hear you?

597
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:19,500
No, no.

598
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,100
No.

599
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,800
We need to call those bad behaviors out, but we should also too.

600
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,700
Call out in a good way.

601
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:31,400
The behaviors that we see and model those, and make sure that we're being intentional about that.

602
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,400
So I want to double-click into that Tomika.

603
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,700
How do you do it in honoring and respectful way?

604
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,900
I think it's about Tak tone and timing, right?

605
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,800
So it's about when you do it, so I will give an example of something that happened today.

606
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
So this is like I am sharing, right?

607
00:53:50,800 --> 00:54:06,100
Like some of my baggage life is not perfect and especially in leadership, but I joined a call today and I had a member of my staff was saying well sometimes our leader doesn't give clear directions, but they didn't know that.

608
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:06,800
I was on the call.

609
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,100
So it's not helped myself.

610
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,800
I could not help us up because it was like, I was Shocked rapidly.

611
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,200
Wait what?

612
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,300
So then I was like, you know, running through my email, the figure like was I not clear?

613
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,100
And so and I just asked them in the moment and that particular point in time.

614
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:28,200
There were few of us on the call for me to say what was not clear.

615
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,300
Like, like talking about this, talk about it right.

616
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:30,600
Now.

617
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,100
What were you not clear on and oh, by the way, if you're not clear, please call me text me.

618
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:41,700
I am all this, and we dealt with literally At that moment and but I am an in-the-moment time.

619
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,100
I believed her London knows this, right?

620
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,500
Right, then it was it.

621
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,600
I am telling you that day.

622
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,600
I can't sleep on it.

623
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:57,000
Like I literally cannot take it to bed with me, if there's something awry, I have to talk to you about it that day before I close my eyes.

624
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,300
I can't let it Fester you, let things Fester.

625
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:10,700
They actually get worse than they were when you originally encountered it like you start overthinking it, you start processing, and you start adding on your own stuff to it, but I think it has a lot to do with timing.

626
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,900
So And so you do that as it's comfortable for you, right?

627
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,600
So if you're an in-the-moment type of person deal with it, then move on.

628
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:27,900
If you're not process, take I know some folks like to process things, process it and then it sometimes it really involved.

629
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,900
You pull a person to the side and having a separate conversation because, guess what?

630
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,500
No one likes to be embarrassed.

631
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,700
None of us are who, like, who are signing up for embarrassment every day?

632
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,500
Not me.

633
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,700
I don't wanna be embarrassed, that's part of what drives me to, to succeed.

634
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,000
In the world is to not fail, definitely not be embarrassed.

635
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,500
And so, none of us likes to feel that way.

636
00:55:47,500 --> 00:56:01,500
And so, it's a matter of making sure that you're doing it and honoring, the person with their, with respect, right, giving them, the respect that they're done and doing it in a safe space and, and Tomika, I think the asterisk there.

637
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,500
You know what you just said?

638
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,800
Is that you care, right?

639
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:11,700
You care as a leader, and you want to make sure that if someone doesn't feel like they brought up to speed up their brought up to speed, or there's something missing that you want to address it.

640
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,100
And you know, there's lots of ways to do it.

641
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,400
Like you said, it's in the moment.

642
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:24,800
It's taking them to the side, but I think it goes back to, you know, Tak tone and timing and then this idea of like the language you use the context in which you're communicating right in the culture.

643
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,200
Right?

644
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:33,600
I mean, everyone is engaged differently, everyone receives information differently and received criticism attention.

645
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:33,900
Right?

646
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,700
Like you're exactly that person.

647
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:36,900
Are you?

648
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:44,200
Absolutely and I think that's a really powerful element of Leadership is being aware and cognizant of that.

649
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,300
And to me, that's empathy, right.

650
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,400
That's a version of empathy in the moment in an instance.

651
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:55,200
And you know, that is something that I hate to say, it is not something that you're born with.

652
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:17,900
I mean the reality is, you learn that over time, you learn that, their experiences, you learn that through, you know, going through the battles, you learn that through managing and leading different types of people and working with different groups of people, to build up that skill set and ability to deliver that message or Support that colleague or whatever it is At that moment in time, but you got again, it's not easy.

653
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,100
You have to pay attention.

654
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,800
You have to be engaged as a leader that has to be a priority of yours.

655
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,800
Otherwise, you just you're just a driver, you just hate, you know, just drive and push it.

656
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,100
I know we're running on time, but I have to say this.

657
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,600
I like to consider it like, spinach in my teeth, right?

658
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:35,900
Yes.

659
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,700
Spinach in your teeth.

660
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:45,400
You want someone to tell you that you have to walk around at a party with the you care about the person.

661
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,600
Tell him, tell him what's right?

662
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,100
And what's wrong?

663
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,400
That's good.

664
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:57,600
I, you know, before we wrap up here, I just gotta say, both Tomika in London that I don't know.

665
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,800
I think, Two guys are doing is pretty powerful.

666
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,700
Not only you lead distributed teams, but it's super teams in healthcare.

667
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:08,200
And I mean, when we talk about taking care of people, empathetic leadership is important.

668
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,600
Overall well-being is as important, right?

669
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:20,500
So anyway, I just want to thank you to before we run out of time here for just sharing the stage and sharing best practices that you are seeing on your thigh.

670
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,200
And thank you.

671
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,500
Thank you for your leadership and your leadership in the tech space and doing what you're doing.

672
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,300
You're In the game and you're doing it, right?

673
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:39,400
You're doing it better, and we can all see that and so appreciate having the opportunity just to be on a panel with you next to the greatness.

674

So really appreciate that.

675
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:49,700
Yeah, you better share the stage with you three and it's been a, it's been a privilege and hopefully this has helped folks that were listening in today.

676
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,200
And if there's anything you need, let us know.

677
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:59,200
Wow, I am like feeling the love wrapping up at time here.

678
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:09,500
And I know we didn't get through all of the questions, but this was so rich and there were some tactical takeaways some really meaningful insights shared.

679
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,100
I hope all of you took something away.

680
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,400

After these rich conversations.

689
