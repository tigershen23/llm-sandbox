30
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:57,300
So we had to have the Aloha Island Vibes because, you know, I am actually out here in Hawaii right now, and I am in Ewa Beach because my husband's from here, but I am from La.

31
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:06,500
So I am still learning about the Aloha Spirit and the pigeon accent, and even how I pronounce Hawaii.

32
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,000
Like it's with a like a V pronunciation.

33
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
Write the W?

34
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:11,800
Yeah.

35
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,700
If you're strictly speaking.

36
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,100
Yeah, be Hawaii.

37
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,600
Actually have a lot Hawaii.

38
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:23,100
Like, if you see it spelled out there's like a little accent kind of apostrophe after the first.

39
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,200
I so but you know, people argue, no say it, the normal way.

40
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,800
Awesome.

41
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:40,500
Well, test is when you're driving down the highway in your life, What's kalanianaole you like the all the, all the syllable vowels, right?

42
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,500
Totally.

43
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
I butcher all the names.

44
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:51,000
So still learning over here but you're from Hawaii, and we have a quick little poll that Katie in The Green Room.

45
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,600
Our producer.

46
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,200
Thank you for pulling that up.

How many of you have visited, Hope Hawaii, feel free to drop in about they're not yet or yes you have Gone ahead and drop your votes.

48
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,600
All right.

49
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,100
Oh, here we go.

50
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Awesome.

51
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,300
So we have got a good chunk of folks who have Vince of Hawaii and also a good number who haven't yet.

52
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,200
So we're kind of even here.

53
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,800
I mean with that Alex, you actually grew up in Hawaii what part?

54
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,200
So I grew up in a hunter Lulu which is, so I am a city boy in Hawaii terms.

55
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,500
Yeah, for sure we got the tunes.

56
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,600
I was looking all the landscape shots as I was kind of putting me in my feels because it's yeah, it's a beautiful place.

57
00:06:47,700 --> 00:07:02,300
It is and you actually went to Punahou which is a private high school here on Oahu and I had to throw Obama's face on it because Obama went to Punahou, right?

58
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,100
Yeah, right.

59
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,800
He was in the class before my older brother who also want to go home.

60
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,400
So I mean, I never crossed paths with my brother did, but he was not obviously was not famous.

61
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,300
Then he was known as Barry at school.

62
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,100
So you know, he's just like another kid, totally it's.

63
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:27,000
But when you were going through school you know I guess it had he been known, yet I guess not yet, right?

64
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:33,400
Totally, not totally not yeah, we're looking at now is the love as an Alum though.

65
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,800
Is it a big deal to be a Punahou Alum and like Obama went there as well?

66
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:52,200
You know, it's funny for sure that I think the school super proud of that as you would be, you know, it's funny because our class, my graduating class.

67
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,700
But now has another celebrity that they're kind of attached to from the clouds, which is carry out.

68
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,100
Another was one of the judges on Dad's.

69
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:09,400
So it was like, wow, these little sort of celebrity connection that I take precedence in a particular class.

70
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,300
Super fun.

71
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,000
All right.

72
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,300
Well, I would love to dive into three parts for this time together.

73
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,600
And, you know, first diving into thank you for sharing the little bit of the Aloha.

74
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:48,700
But diving into your background, your story, your journey about all of this, you know, you're a Serial startup marketing leader and so you know, just walking through a little bit of that journey and then going into the big question that we have around how first base was To get its first 100 paying customers will go into that through Linkedin as an engine.

75
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,500
And then finally, we'd love to wrap it up with just some sort of point of encouragement for the group that we have here.

76
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:07,400
So let us start with your story and if you could just track back and walk us through first of all, like you got to be a little crazy To Be A Serial startup leader.

77
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:17,200
I mean you have been through multiple vc-backed startups building the marketing Ian, can you walk us through a little bit of your Tech background?

78
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,800
Yeah, sure.

79
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,900
I mean, I think, you know, I stumbled into startups relatively early in my career, you know, you know.

80
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:35,800
And as a marketer one of the things you know, I think about it as I didn't start a, I didn't start out intending to go into marketing per se was a little bit journey to get into that.

81
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:56,200
I was actually in the field, you know, Solutions engineer and then kind of morphed into and then I kind of Not that I wanted to be kind of in the morning, the center of things and there was doing like tactical marketing and then, but I will end in a start-up where I ended up owning a product line that I had to kind of do everything for, you know.

82
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,900
And, you know, went through an acquisition.

83
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,600
It was my first sort of, like, eye-opener of like, oh my gosh, you know, this happens in startups, right?

84
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:27,000
And, you know, and from there, I think, you know, journeying through a product management, a little bit of segments of product management, and then I Think I got a taste of the marketing side because I started owning product marketing, you know, and then it just sort of dawned on me that I really, really liked that aspect of the work I was doing.

85
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,500
I mean, not putting on product management enjoyed this, my stent in it but it's a very, very, very process-oriented thing and you know it has its own world.

86
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,700
I love the fact that you know, you know.

87
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,300
And I was already at that point doing startups, right?

88
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,100
And experience all the ups and downs.

89
00:10:46,500 --> 00:11:01,200
That you have in startups like a start-up start an emotional rollercoaster, basically, right at the marketing, part of that, what was fascinating for me is saying, like, Okay, well, how do you actually boot up the connection to, to the market, right?

90
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,500
And in, and I start off in B, to B and B to B is itself.

91
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:12,500
A very to be startups, are a particular, kind of marketing as anyone who does it know.

92
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:25,300
It's As much there's as much intuition as data because your sample set of what you're dealing with and customers like your daily with maybe dozens and then hundreds and that, you know, you're not dealing with like okay.

93
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,300
We have a, you know, a million people interacting with the brand, right?

94
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:45,900
So it's I think that sort of intuition and content and how to create that connection to the market was really fascinating for me, especially because in a start-up environment, usually start Founders or Like you know, how do we do this?

95
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:57,600
It's the it's often times at least known discipline for Founders because they tend to come from a technical background and that's one of the joys and challenges of being a B2B marketer and start out, right?

96
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,800
That's right on.

97
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,800
Can you walk us through some of the journey?

98
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:13,400
Like, well, we're different tech companies that you have had the opportunity to work with and, you know, just even to describe a little bit of, like the engines that you have had.

99
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,100
You build over time?

100
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,200
Yeah, I mean, I first kind of marketing leadership get came in a company called package design.

101
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:34,200
It was started by a Serial entrepreneur and, you know, it was is one of those situations where there's probably like, you know, like 20 people I have started at multiple companies that pretty small, right?

102
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,100
First marketer kind of walking in the door.

103
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:48,400
Maybe there's a few things written by an enterprising salesperson or someone else that sort of thing or you know someone else who owns And marketing, but it was like, we need someone to go do this and yeah.

104
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,700
So this was a while ago.

105
00:12:50,700 --> 00:13:01,900
So marketing Tech was very nascent, you know, Mark has exploded as we know and there's like a bazillion tools to choose from now and everything, you know.

106
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:13,400
But, you know, in the sort of the naissance of that flick, how do we actually just got to be a be effective online with web, with SEO, you know, just the, the foundation's is where I started with that.

107
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:20,500
They first automation stack, I went to an Israeli startup called quali actually.

108
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:34,300
We rebranded I came there to go from that first start up, and we grew up and then basically went to an Israeli startup called quali and had a really fun time there, but it was a kind of company that was reaped.

109
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:45,500
It was pivoting, you know, so it wasn't, there was a little bit of marketing at that, but they need to completely redo the positioning, The Branding, the message, They were shifting into a different market.

110
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:55,700
So that was an interesting, one against River, you know, my job was like to get them from that, you know, from The Old Company to a new identity, a new brand, new growth market.

111
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,500
So that was a journey there.

112
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:58,900
I did.

113
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:07,400
It start up called kentico, which was in the kind of monitoring space of quality was sort of in the devops space can take was sort of in the monitoring.

114
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:22,100
I did a couple of monitoring things, cantik was one where there was this huge analytics engine, Again, you know, new technology, sort of new approach to an old problem, kind of thing and again, very, very little existed there.

115
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,000
I was the first marketer in the door, you know, building.

116
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You know, it's like one of those things where you have got like five or seven arms, mostly basically contractors as agencies and doing all this stuff for you, you know, trying to build out a tech stack and then growing a staff from there.

117
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,400
From there.

118
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,300
I actually took a little bit of a sideways John into a later stage.

119
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,200
Build out as a head of product marketing company called thousand eyes, where they were kind of trying to get from that.

120
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:58,700
Let us say 30 40 to 100 journeys, and they needed to redo their go-to market around, you know what's the cross?

121
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,800
The chasm message, and the content of the thought leadership and building that all out.

122
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:11,000
So we built a big research, go to market research arm that really, you know, to engage market with the data we have and stuff like that.

123
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So what through an acquisition there?

124
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:30,600
To a little small tiny Australian startup called sineva that wanted to wear the founders were, you know, had built a really cool product and you know, focus on remote work actually, which is sort of the dotted line to how I got to first base because I started get interested in the space.

125
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,800
And that, you know, they had an outcome in mind which was they want to plug into larger tech companies.

126
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:50,200
So, the job there was a go to market and really grab some share, get some mind share your proof of the product, you know, build a pipeline and at join another company, which happens so Palo Alto.

127
00:15:50,200 --> 00:16:03,300
They were acquired by, we required by Palo Alto networks and then from there, you know, I did a stint at a company called pack of fabric which is like a newfangled Telco likes is totally automated Telco because I knew one of the co-founders there.

128
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,800
So again full stack, build them almost all these things.

129
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,000
It was a complete from the ground stack, build out, you know, and demand, gen nothing, no programs, no stack.

130
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,800
No nothing, right?

131
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Very little content and then kind of try to grow that.

132
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:46,200
And first base is sort of is an interesting case where you know as you know hinted by the title of this, the company had actually grown a lot through an incredible organic sort of social presence of the founder which I think is really fascinating to look at and learn from as I look at it and have an I came in again to kind of build the Systemic stuff of marketing, right?

133
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,500
From the ground up.

134
00:16:48,500 --> 00:17:09,700
So that's, I mean that those are kind of like my journey points, you know, in as fast as a nutshells, I could put him Incredible Journey and like, wow, major props and respect because there's probably a lot of Battle Scars and stories that you have for being able to Journey with so many companies.

135
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,300
So many different.

136
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:29,100
Founders, what are some of the like if Looking back at that Journey, you know if you were to pull out one or two nuggets of the things that really worked, when it when you're talking about like your stack, like this is the one, two, three Tech stacks that I always build.

137
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:39,700
And these are the layers of foundation that I always start with like, what works and then what didn't work maybe if you'd give us you know, a nugget of each of those, that would be great.

138
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,200
Sure.

139
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:57,300
I think the foundational Foundation to The stack is, is the message, you know, the message is the thing that drives, you know where you want to take your brand identity, its understanding, you know, getting to a really clear sense of what's our distinctive.

140
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,700
And what is it that?

141
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:04,100
We because I think it's sort of like marketing is about connecting, right?

142
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:24,600
And a B2B buyers, not just a Persona, they're a person and their that I think the foundation is empathic connection to the audience and to the problems, a B2B startup has a problem to solve and you have to often times.

143
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,600
If you're innovating, you have to unpack that problem for people.

144
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,400
Because if there hasn't been a solution probably, they have just suppress awareness of the problem.

145
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,100
It's there.

146
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,200
It might be very painful, but they haven't really impacted.

147
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:46,300
So if you can unpack that then that's the Foundational thing that allows your message and your mechanics to create a connection.

148
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:57,200
You know, people we want to be felt seen, you know, as a buyer I want to feel seen like you get what I am going through and you're speaking to my needs, right?

149
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
So that's the real foundation.

150
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,400
And then, you know, on top of that is then is I am just a huge believer that, you know.

151
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,700
Okay?

152
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:14,400
So text acts and stuff like that are all about your data, you know, Know your data is Destiny and marketing, right?

153
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:24,700
So like building a really clean hygienic sort of data set knowing what the value and relative like cost of that data is important, right?

154
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:36,700
Knowing whether or not you can find your audience, Sofia with, sufficiently targeted way because ultimately marketing is, you know, enables commercial things to happen, like in this, you know, opportunities and Pipeline and stuff like that.

155
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:53,500
Right is, is sort of like is always taking an Ouch what works for me is always making sure that the way I think about the data and how we identify our potential buyers is a strong fit sometimes that you can just get that out of off the shelf.

156
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,500
You know, whatever.

157
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:04,600
And sometimes you can't and some which case you have to be willing to go there and enrich and think about the metadata that will help you Target and connect to the right people.

158
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,100
You know.

159
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,800
So the because the rest of the stack is really, you know whether whatever choose your automation sweet.

160
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:23,700
You know, I have kind of been on a Marketo sort of Journey for a little while so that's kind of the way I tend to build but it's like that's your journey in terms of the stack Stacks can work for whatever your purpose is, right?

161
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:35,300
But it's really about making sure the data is a good fit so you can deliver that empathic connection and open people's minds to the possibility.

162
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,400
That their problem is something that can be solved.

163
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:52,100
And if you're the one who's communicating about it, effectively and connecting with them, then they're going to say, well I think I am going to give mentally speaking this brand, a chance to tell me how to solve it right the rest of the mechanics.

164
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,100
I mean, let us face it.

165
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,300
How many ways can you communicate?

166
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,000
With people, they haven't changed.

167
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,700
All right, you know, you have email, you have various platform, kind of things, you know, experiences like this.

168
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,100
Right in person things phone calls, right?

169
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:14,300
Let us just, you know, I mean, in B2B you're not sending a lot of text messages, you know, typically, right?

170
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:24,300
So like your mechanics are very similar that automation Stacks are commercial choices your data and how you curate that.

171
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,600
Data at the right cost and volume and, and targeted.

172
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Sort of is the key anyway, that was a long dissertation, but that's I think those are some of the key things I think for success in B2B marketing.

173
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,500
That's great.

174
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,200
And so, when you say data, if you could get a little tactical, are you talking about?

175
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,800
Just the key, insights and attributes on the buyer and their behavior.

176
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Like what kind of data points are you immediately setting up your Tech stack to Capture?

177
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,200
So I want to know the ICP from a sales point of view, right?

178
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:16,300
Whoo-hoo constitutes the best Prospect, you know, the partnership with sales is super important because the pipeline of service to sales is like you're doing marketing engagement, other engagement, you set meetings through SD or bdr teams Etc.

179
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,900
What's the ICP really mean?

180
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,400
What are the points of insight or qualification or Discovery, right?

181
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,500
That really matter those The thing is, I am going to draw drawn, and so I want to do a really good brainstorm there might be.

182
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,000
For example, if you have technical qualifiers, right?

183
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,900
They have to have these conditions in their environment.

184
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,900
Technically speaking to sell your product, they have to have theirs from a graphic size of company, all those sorts of thing.

185
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,000
What's the zone, right?

186
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,900
You want to be in.

187
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:51,400
There are, you know what title classes and B2B, oftentimes, you're dealing with title classes, and then there are sorts of like propensity to buy indicators their keywords.

188
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,900
You can find there are other things like that, right?

189
00:22:53,900 --> 00:23:04,700
So, and some of those things, again, are collected commercially by, you know, big databases companies, like, Zoom info or others, or whatever, and some of them are just not, and you just have to go and get it right.

190
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:23,900
There're different ways to do that, but part of it is also the calculation of targeting and going finding data to go after an audience that you have profiled as it were based on, you know, data that would indicate they could benefit from your solution and would be open to it.

191
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,300
Says the venue based right?

192
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:39,200
Like hey, if you go to conference, you have you are sort of targeting but you're also having a certain amount of Randomness right to like, people come with interest in all sorts of reasons to various venues.

193
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:54,100
So the balance of how much but you're going to pay a lot for certain kinds of datasets engaged more or less engaged datasets versus you might pay a lot less to discover although you have to go and engage it.

194
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:02,900
So that balance because marketing is economics to as like you have a finite amount of money to spend to reach the market, right?

195
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,100
I don't know.

196
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,000
That's at least some of how I think about it.

197
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:12,000
Any do not dues like, is there something clearly that you have learned through failure?

198
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,300
I don't really believe in content syndication.

199
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,100
Hmm.

200
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,200
And here's why because a lot of (Kit) because content in syndication, it's in of itself.

201
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,100
But I think now they're all sorts of places where people consuming things that you subscribe to this.

202
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,200
Whatever thing you know you go to the site over and over to consume stuff.

203
00:24:32,700 --> 00:25:02,800
How much brand awareness do you really have when you can when you consume a piece of interesting content from that site that you have been visiting over and over again very low right clutch often times the price you pay for that can be pretty high you know I mean because like the brand awareness and that the link to a solution, you know, is Important because often times when you're trying to communicate, it's just those little small degrees of awareness that makes someone more like this segment.

204
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,400
I am going to actually read this email or mmm.

205
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,800
I am gonna actually, you know, right?

206
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,100
You know, like consider a conversation.

207
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,300
It's we're dealing with in because so much of the buyer journey is hidden right today?

208
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:22,900
Much of the buyer journey is become more digital and more invisible for a variety of reasons.

209
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,800
Privacy reasons.

210
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,900
Also, Two things.

211
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:37,000
So, your brand awareness points and how much you are paying to get those, that mental awareness, and thought leadership awareness, that degree advances over time.

212
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,200
Many cases ways you don't see It's good.

213
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:41,800
Okay.

214
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,200
All right.

215
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,500
Due to time and this is this has been rich.

216
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,900
I hope folks can still stay beyond our 30 minute Mark here.

217
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,600
This is our first one, give us Grace on.

218
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,400
They're just such Rich content to be able to discuss here.

219
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,800
Let us jump into the LinkedIn.

220
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,600
Yeah, I beg, you know, I think this is like the burning question that we all have.

221
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:16,000
How did you guys get 100 paying customers Within In months of literally only Chris, herds LinkedIn profile.

222
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I mean, he's got, is it up to 60,000 followers?

223
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,400
Now?

224
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:28,900
So as long as 50 feet between 55 and 60, I think now and just to give some do, like he's also very active on Twitter and is about the same number of followers there.

225
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,700
So I think there's a combo effect, you know, there're different objects, audiences, that lurk different places.

226
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:43,100
And I think the, you know, the lessons I take away is that You know, he took what I was.

227
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:51,600
What I am going to say is a cultural thought leadership angle, he was not, flogging the service, right?

228
00:26:51,700 --> 00:27:07,400
He was speaking to a big felt need and I think that the thing that's the important lesson there is that your you have a corporate brand and a corporate brand, has a communicate at a business level of value, right?

229
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,300
Corporate Brands need to take business value, thought leadership.

230
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:27,100
But in Social, you're really dealing often times with a different level felt need, which is about the things that are driving those the needs and the felt sort of problems or the challenges in the environment, you know.

231
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:34,600
So I think one of the lessons from what I saw see you know that Chris has done is he really aimed at that higher level?

232
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,300
What I would say?

233
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,600
Cultural thought leadership.

234
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,200
Hmm.

235
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:44,100
Now in the remote work space, you know, pandemic the Of work, all that kind of stuff was a big ferment, right?

236
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:50,200
But there maybe you know it's but whatever the field you're in.

237
00:27:50,400 --> 00:28:05,600
I think that social impact really comes from taking that Higher Culture, maybe it's a tech culture angle, maybe it's in this case is about future of work and things like that is very broad, but I think the big lesson is that it can't be about you.

238
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,100
It has to be about what's having a big impact of what.

239
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:18,300
What is a point of view, you know, that adds value to people's lives or ORS, helps direct of way of thinking.

240
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,100
So, Chris has taken a very, very assertive.

241
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,400
Very assertive stance.

242
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:24,900
On.

243
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:39,800
A lot of things he's been willing to put his kind of ego online and say this is what's going to happen, you know, you won't be if you don't Embrace remote work, as a company, you're just going to be less competitive remote work.

244
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,900
Oriented companies are going to be the more successful.

245
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,900
This is akin to e-commerce.

246
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:54,400
He's taking he's making these sort of level of claims and that is a so that's a stance that Doesn't really have anything to persuade doing with first base.

247
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:08,000
And I think that's really important lesson, you know, that's really interesting, and he's very like he's willing to push the bar of his perspective and even get angry, you know.

248
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,500
And I think that's, you know, it's a, it's one of those things where, you know, that does get attention.

249
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:29,800
But it's because it's pushing a, it's pushing the bounds of comfort without being, you know, may be disrespectful but it's saying there're some places where you To push the bounds of comfortable thinking, right about things.

250
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And that's something that I think is very effective.

251
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:44,000
You know in Social especially if you're not coming from the angle and you know like would you like to buy one of these kind of a no angle?

252
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,600
That's huge.

253
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,700
I mean, it seemed like Chris.

254
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,200
He also was able to just own his profile like you didn't have to.

255
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,400
There wasn't a marketing leader that came along his side and was Like hey you need to build your profile.

256
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Like he took his own initiative right?

257
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,300
As a Founder.

258
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:17,300
Yeah, I mean I think that's conviction, you know, I think as a founder or someone who's going to lead out on that, you know, you have to have a certain amount of ego strength, you have to have, you know, willingness to go out and not be perfect.

259
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,200
And you have to have a leave with a lot of conviction.

260
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,700
What do you really have?

261
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,300
You know, super strong conviction about that.

262
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,800
That is speaks to the zone of the world or fly fulfill traffic America.

263
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,700
Sorry I got my little one that just entered into the room.

264
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:43,100
This is what happens, remote work, folks is you know, that level of conviction comes through, right?

265
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,200
And I think that speaks to where people are at and that see, that's connection, right?

266
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,300
That's, that's a real connection, you know, your brand corporate brand cannot do that at the same level, you know?

267
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,900
No, it's good.

268
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:08,200
So okay so just speaking tactically here, you know, strip strategy and tactics of like okay if I have a B2B SAS brand where I want to elevate my LinkedIn.

269
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,200
What if I don't have a Founder?

270
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:21,200
Like Chris heard that, you know, has that sort of even the energy the strategy to put into LinkedIn.

271
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:21,700
Yeah.

272
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:39,500
Could it be another figure Within The organization that takes that sort of cultural Transcendent stance where they're not getting into buy, buy, buy my product, but like they're really taking a stance culture like can it be or does it need a come from a founder of a company?

273
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,500
I think what recent what needs to be happened?

274
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,400
Is the founder.

275
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:43,800
You know?

276
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:52,000
And yes I mean I haven't previously worked for a company where the founders has had this much sort of social presence.

277
00:31:52,500 --> 00:32:01,700
But I have worked in a space where You know, and I have worked with more techie products and sometimes those just aren't as favorable to the level of like culture thought leadership.

278
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:13,600
But I think the thing is that someone has to have some conviction and courage to go push at things and say, we're going to take some stance on something that's relevant to what we do.

279
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,400
And in service of what people need in our environment.

280
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:27,700
And maybe you have data, you know, for example, maybe you have data that, that if you actually like positioned in it, Shushes others in the industry.

281
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,500
You have to be willing to do have some controversy.

282
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
I mean, a very nerdy sense.

283
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,800
I will give an example for when I was a thousand eyes.

284
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,000
One of the things I saw, when I got there was here, we have got this amazing.

285
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,200
We have got this data about what's happening in these various Cloud applications and stuff, and one of the things realize there's a lot of Business Leaders.

286
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:50,000
It leaders are like, when something goes wrong with slack or whatever, it's like, nobody knows really why it's happening.

287
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,200
Because of course, if your slack, you're trying to fix that, but you're not going to say like are out all that like It's not your focus to go.

288
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,600
Analyze, what's happening like from an outside in perspective, so it's sort of like we had this data.

289
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:14,800
So like, let us go put it out there, you know, and that probably was and I fact I know that was uncomfortable for some applications and Cloud providers and such and, you know, we put our reports and stuff like that.

290
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:24,600
But are found when our co-founders had the conviction, this was the right thing to do because there was so much lack of understanding, you know.

291
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:51,600
So we went And I just built a program to kind of push that out there in a responsive way and that got a lot of coverage and attention and all that sort of thing and became some that we could stand on to say we're all about providing intelligence and visibility even though in some ways it might be uncomfortable to call out like hey yeah you know this part was the internet but this part might have been the provider sorry but it's just what we see, you know, it's very helpful.

292
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,500
It was very helpful.

293
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:58,000
People Express a lot of appreciation for but Others expressed that it was uncomfortable for them.

294
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:05,400
Our co-founder had the conviction that this was worth doing, and we're pushing hard at that you know.

295
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:19,300
So there's you know is there something like that you can contribute to the dialogue to the value of people's lives that will push the boundaries of the push of comfort a little bit to get at what's real.

296
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:28,100
So good about let that simmer with all of us because there's something really powerful about that.

297
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Thought, right there.

298
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,500
All right, we have got some questions coming in.

299
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:43,699
Let us pull up and questioned on to stage and if you don't mind answering this, what is the most effective LinkedIn marketing tactic you have used at first base?

300
00:34:44,800 --> 00:35:03,100
From know, I tend to believe that especially as a, if you're a startup, that's not very well-known yet.

301
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:13,900
And, and let us remember that every startup is not very well-known as much as you think like, well, you know, people already know as they don't write, even when you think they really know you, most people don't.

302
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,900
So, I think awareness you know it's like it's the you know the truism awareness that comes in before demand.

303
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,300
That one thing I really like from S cost point of view is doing per company.

304
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:35,100
Targeted awareness ads you know because creating and going Beyond just your narrow buyer.

305
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,900
You know going a little broader.

306
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:44,400
I really like that because I think that, you know, it creates brand awareness and it creates if you're proposing sort of problem.

307
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,800
That's You solved it creates an again awareness like oh this is something that we could solve again much of the time.

308
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,200
When doing something new, you have to sell the problem right before you ever get to sell the solution.

309
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:03,500
So I really like that as, you know, as a way and I have seen in other cases that it works from Prospect point of view.

310
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:12,200
It also really works in a pipeline point of view, you know, there's a lot of people when someone is considering a purchase that need to start becoming wearing of a brand to, you know.

311
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,000
So I really like that.

312
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,700
That's incredibly helpful.

313
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,900
We have got another question here from Justin.

314
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,300
How do you bridge the gap?

315
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,100
Between cultural messaging and corporate messaging.

316
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,100
Such a good question.

317
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,600
So I think you have to let them have breathing room between them, right?

318
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:40,000
Let your cultural message be it and then the then you're just doing breadcrumbs, basically, right?

319
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,600
You know, because your corporate messaging should also be value, added thought leadership.

320
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:55,100
In much, you know, you know, like how to, you know, in a sense you're trying to answer, how to solve a problem that you have that you might not be fully aware of, but we're going to help you understand, right?

321
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,900
That's the cultural thought leadership, the corporate thought leadership is business value thought leadership.

322
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:07,600
In both cases, there will be a lighter breadcrumb Trail to Brand hey you know, like from a cultural point of view, by the way.

323
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,800
This is what, you know, this is why we, you know, we do.

324
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,000
I start first base or this is my first base exists.

325
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,700
That's really you want to go.

326
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:25,200
I, in my opinion you want to A little more, just brand awareness kind of thing, corporate value, sort of business value, thought, leadership your bread crumbing from the solution topic 2.

327
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,200
Here's you know, and here's what, you know, this is what we solve, right?

328
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,700
Your cell, your kind of explaining the world of the problem and all that kind of stuff.

329
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,400
And then, you know, this is what we solve.

330
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,800
So they're your bread Crumb from both of them because people don't want to be like assaulted with a pitch.

331
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,800
They want to be, they want to gain knowledge and insight.

332
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:53,800
And all thought leadership, you have to do that primarily and then you breadcrumb down to if you want to know more, how to solve this, you know, dot here, you know.

333
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,100
So that's my thought about that.

334
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:12,000
I almost see like an Illustrated buyers Journey, kind of map that likes as you were like saying dotted line to Brand, everything has dotted line to brand, but these are like the levels of messaging that really good thought leadership piece, Alex.

335
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,100
Yeah, hopeful thought leadership dots to brand and Corporate value thought leadership dots to Solution.

336
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
That's my mother's whines.

337
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,200
That's good.

338
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,900
All right.

339
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,200
And we have got a question from Sal here.

340
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,400
What are the most effective SEO practices optimizing a marketing campaigns online?

341
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,100
Content?

342
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,800
SEO is all about content now, period, right?

343
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,400
I mean it's that's just the way it's going.

344
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,300
It's less and less about technical games.

345
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:52,800
There are things you can do to Ruin yourself, technically, just by being bad at constructing websites and stuff like that, but mostly that part's pretty straightforward.

346
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:03,000
Now, the most effective SEO practice is to is fundamentally to invest in Awareness targeting, their simple tools to do this, right?

347
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,300
You know, the SEO sort of analysis tools, there's a number of those.

348
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:12,600
And then, and really to do sound, SEO content analysis, fundamentally.

349
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,500
There is a way to write and this is It is a tricky way of it's not easy.

350
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:33,800
You have to make enough domain knowledge and writing flexibility to do this, but you have to Target things to rank and that is a competitive environment keyword environment, but you also have to have it has value.

351
00:39:34,600 --> 00:40:04,300
That's, you know, say you target then you get a Content analysis and then you have to be really good at writing in between that's How you will you know, that's how you win in my opinion and SEO is, is content optimization in a way, that doesn't lose value to the reader from a, you know, kind of like readability and, you know, I mean, consume ability point of view, I can't just be a pile of weird keywords, you know.

352
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,300
But you do have to pay attention to that.

353
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,400
There's a technical angle to SEO writing.

354
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:17,900
That's something I have learned through a lot of, experimentation over a number of companies, and investment in tools and agencies and all that kind of stuff.

355
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:31,300
So that's what, what are your key Tech stack tools that you go to, for SEO and even across the board across other channels, like what CRM?

356
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,600
You know, I mean, social tool, if you have anything like what's your go-to?

357
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:45,900
Well usually I mean You know, I like I said, sort of, I have been kind of building Marketo Salesforce tax for a while.

358
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,900
I mean, that's what's happened.

359
00:40:47,900 --> 00:41:07,300
I like to have in the flexibility in terms of the programmability, from automation, but without getting into true programming there and I, there are a few, there are a few tools that when one of them got deprecated, that, I mean, II think you should invest in a tool.

360
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,200
I think now.

361
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:20,000
If I am not mistaken, there might be what for drift that is a routing tool routing is really important intelligent routing and response to email.

362
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:29,800
Because like, I mean, these are like the fine details of like you send out an email, someone responds to it, who does it get routed to write an owner and sgr?

363
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,500
Someone else.

364
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,000
Whatever.

365
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,500
If there's an auto response, where does that come from?

366
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,500
If there's an auto response, where does that come from?

367
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,300
Right.

368
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,900
If you're sending from an alias, like you don't, you don't want all those things get messed up.

369
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,100
So like there's some nice routing tools.

370
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:45,500
I think that you that are really smart to invest in, you know.

371
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,300
I think there's gosh, you know, the thing too is like tools.

372
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,300
I think there's gosh, you know, the thing too is like tools.

373
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,800
Keep on like getting Consolidated.

374
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,800
Keep on like getting Consolidated.

375
00:41:52,800 --> 00:42:04,700
There was a tool that I really love that detected out of offices and, you know, noted other potential contacts, but I think that you two got bottles or something like that.

376
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,300
I think it called lead, no more Spike that, but I am not sure if they're independent anymore.

377
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:22,300
They're like the little oftentimes, like there's the big tools, and then there's a little, you know, sort of that nuanced things that you if that just prevents you from having to do a lots and lots of manual labor from SEO point of view.

378
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,700
I mean you can choose your semrush or other or sort of analytics tools.

379
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,300
I mean there's a number of those and in fact if you want Fidelity, get two of them.

380
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:40,200
You know and compare because they will have slightly different angles and you know and Gosh.

381
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:48,600
There's a really nice content optimization tool that I am blanking out on right now.

382
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,800
It's I am having a brain fade moment.

383
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,400
I know there's Jasper.

384
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,200
AI is something.

385
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,200
We have been looking into as far as content generation with AI.

386
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:08,300
Yeah, that's been interesting and then I am curious about like, like headlines to like is there a tool we use that co-head code, analyzer headline tool.

387
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,400
Do you guys use anything like that?

388
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:26,800
I mean, for topic subject lines, you know, at this stage not yet, I mean I like some of those tools I think the Part you know part of a lot of what I also get focused on.

389
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:41,700
It's just the technical enablement tools to check the biggest one of the biggest dangers is just like managing your Center reputation and like you know, your ability to get through today.

390
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:53,100
So you know, a combination of your MX toolbox and you know, some other things like that, that will analyze for like how will, you know, how will system see it?

391
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:08,700
You know, I think that's those are you know, kind of your sender reputation and your ability to actually get messages through deliverability and all that is one of the biggest obstacles that we have to overcome now as marketers, right?

392
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:19,100
So I think those, there's the class of tools that deal with that is something to just make sure that you have in your toolbox like don't neglect that, you know.

393
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,100
That's great.

394
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:32,400
Wow, there's so much like Rich information here and it looks like we have answered the questions in queue an Alex.

395
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:41,800
Is there any last word of encouragement or advice that you would give to the broader B2B marketing community?

396
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:51,700
I mean in a start-up scenario I think just remember that.

397
00:44:52,900 --> 00:45:18,800
It's not uncommon that technical Founders for technical Founders in particular Market is the least understood discipline and always be an educator, you know keep hold onto your conviction, you know and you know you're going to have to devote a certain The energy to just be explaining and educating as to the why, why want to do things this way?

398
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,100
Why, why don't do things that way right?

399
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:33,100
You know things you know will work because that knowledge isn't necessarily something you can assume and most Founders want to learn but you just can't leave that Gap.

400
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:42,600
So I think but in an environment like and especially these days, you know, with all the turn, all the things happening, it could be easy to be discouraged, and two questions.

401
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:47,100
Some of your convictions especially this B2B as I said, you don't have massive amounts of data.

402
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:55,300
You, you're doing some things based on best practice and unobserved best practice and things like that, right, you know.

403
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,700
So just hold on to that and be encouraged like that.

404
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:08,200
That's has a lot of value and to lean into being, an educator and Communicator internally as much as externally is super important.

405
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:26,400
And then, you know, and I think that level of conviction and willingness To say like this is, this is the way to go and here's why and here's you know why we want to stick with this is its just super helpful, I think just for you know, kind of like almost like emotional health as a start-up and B2B marketer, right?

406
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:33,900
Like to not get so buffeted by all the, you know, things that demands and all that in the pressures.

407
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:44,500
But also just knowing that you have to You know, educate a lot so that you don't become misunderstood and what you're trying to deliver in the challenges of it.

408
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,000
Right?

409
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,200
Expectations and all that.

410
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,700
That's my big encouragement of one big, big lesson over time.

411
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:50,900
Is that?

412
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,800
Yeah, Market is just not well understood in B2B often times.

413
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,400
And so, part of our job is to be that, you know, educator internally.

414
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,800
And as we do it reinforces our convictions, right?

415
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,000
Helps us believe in what we're doing and like to follow that path.

416
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,900
