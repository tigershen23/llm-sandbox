All right, let us do this.

29
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,700
Okay.

30
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:41,500
So before we jump into some tacos and margaritas, let us do a quick poll.

31
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
All right, so Linda in our Green Room, I can see her.

32
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Maybe y'all can't see her but I see you.

33
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:47,900
Linda.

34
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,200
Do you mind putting that pole?

35
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,000
There we go.

36
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,800
Have you cooked with a virtual Chef before?

37
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,100
If yes, today's my first time drop in your votes.

38
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,900
If you haven't already, it looks like for majority of you.

39
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:07,400
This is your first time, so, oh, we got some other folks who have done this before.

40
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
All right.

41
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,200
Okay.

42
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,900
Well great.

43
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,200
We have got a packed out agenda, an amazing Chef that I see in the Green Room Chef Giovanni who I will introduce shortly.

44
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,700
Let us pull up that agenda here.

45
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,100
So today what we're going.

46
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,900
Do is we will also introduce you to the chef.

47
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
We will start with our cocktails mocktails, then we will go through the overview of tools.

48
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Protein prep, do a taco.

49
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,900
Check in with one another garnish tortilla prep.

50
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,800
And then we will do the Tocco assembly.

51
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,400
Have the party at the end, final remarks.

52
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,500
And then there's going to be a photo winning up.

53
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,700
So be sure to take those photos, and we're going to share it with one another.

54
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,200
Now with that.

55
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:58,300
I would love to introduce the chef, he has worked in the Austin restaurant scene for over 10 years.

56
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,700
He's made relationships with some of the most popular restaurant groups in Austin.

57
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:09,800
On, if you're from Austin, you would know these names Bryce Gilmore, Mark, bewley Sam, Hillman Mass.

58
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,900
These are really big chefs out there.

59
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:16,099
So Chef Philip Speer who runs assembly.

60
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:30,900
And he's had four nominations with the James Beard Foundation hired, Chef Giovanni to come to become a key member of the His kitchen management team and their chef Giovanni serves as the sous chef for the Commodore.

61
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:38,200
And this is allowed him to expand his knowledge and his skills within modern Mexican Cuisine.

62
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:45,600
And so now, he operates as the executive chef at assembly kitchen leading the team with menu creation and talent screening.

63
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,900
So with that Chef Giovanni.

64
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,400
Join me on stage.

65
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,600
Hello.

66
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,700
Taco Tuesday.

67
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah.

68
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Yes, I am excited.

69
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,500
Hola como estas.

70
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,800
Hi, muy.

71
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,900
Bien, muy Brent.

72
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,300
Yeah, super excited, Taco Tuesday, officially today.

73
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,500
We're going to have a great time.

74
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
We're going to eat some really delicious food and enjoy each other's company.

75
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,400
So let us do it.

76
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,500
Perfect.

77
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,100
Well, I think especially the best way to start off.

78
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,800
Taco Tuesday is with a God, dang, Margarita.

79
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,200
So let us get right into it.

80
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,400
Right?

81
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,300
Y'all, I would like to mention.

82
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,100
If you have any questions whatsoever.

83
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,600
Unfortunately, I am not able to see you guys on my end of the screen.

84
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,000
But please throw those questions right in the chat.

85
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,200
I can see it on the right of my monitor, and we can definitely get you, those answers, right?

86
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,200
So, the best thing about this Margarita is that it's going to be ready in 30.

87
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,500
Against.

88
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,100
All right.

89
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:59,500
So all the items we will need for this Margarita as follows here, when Empty Glass, beautiful lime, our Margarita mixture here and I just have this little plate with my lime salt in it.

90
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,100
Alright.

91
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
So here we go, guys.

92
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,500
This is a quick trick.

93
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,700
First thing I am going to do is, let us go ahead and cut this line right down the middle.

94
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:13,400
Like so, Then we're going to go ahead and grab a little wedge from this lime.

95
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,900
Slice it in the middle.

96
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:24,500
Just going to score it, allowing us to place it over our glass and really Rim it with this fresh lime juice.

97
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,400
More flavor from here.

98
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,300
We're just going to tip it right onto that glass.

99
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,200
Sorry for the scratchy's sounds not pleasant.

100
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,700
But here we go.

101
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,700
Fill it up with ice like that.

102
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,900
Beautiful.

103
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,200
Good healthy, Shake.

104
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,000
Everybody get that.

105
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,400
Taco dance already started.

106
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,300
This is where we're getting that move-in ready.

107
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
Getting ready for it.

108
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,500
Pop, the cap.

109
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,900
Fill her up extra.

110
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,000
Squeeze of lime.

111
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,400
Quick Trick, there we go, guys.

112
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,200
Beautiful.

113
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,100
Margarita right in front of you.

114
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,700
Cheers y'all.

115
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,200
Beautiful.

116
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,800
How's it tasting?

117
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,600
Everyone like the margarita?

118
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,800
Cheers, I love the chairs.

119
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Perfect.

120
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,200
Super Fresh lime juice, is exactly what makes this Margarita, really pop?

121
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,500
I like a little strawberry floater on my margarita.

122
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,600
Someone asked do we like floaters here in Austin, Texas?

123
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,100
That's a hell.

124
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,600
Yes.

125
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,500
So beautiful.

126
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,900
So now that we got our drink settled in front of us.

127
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,500
We can finally get to relax, you know, get our drinking on, it's only makes us better chefs and the end of it.

128
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,400
I think it's also going to make us a little more confident.

129
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,600
So when we are cooking these tacos, everything is pre cooked for you.

130
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,500
We're really just looking to get those garnishes on the plate.

131
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,400
We're looking to heat up this meat or vegetables depending on the kit you get.

132
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,200
And then so it's really simple trick.

133
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,300
We got our super nice tacos.

134
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,300
It's going to feed a lot of people.

135
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,200
Tonight.

136
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,200
So if you have anyone in your house with you, please tag them along and let us get on with the show.

137
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600
So we got our drink out of the way, right?

138
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,200
Let us go ahead and talk about utensils and tools.

139
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,200
Okay, super, super simple.

140
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,200
The most things we were going to be needing is actually pans, right?

141
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,600
Because we have got three proteins.

142
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,300
We got a Carnitas, we have chicken tinga, and we have our Koji marinated skirt steak.

143
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,200
If you did get the vegetarian, you're going to have our much.

144
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,000
Shroom mixture, some miso carrots, and also a butternut squash to saute.

145
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,400
Super, super simple.

146
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,700
So like I said, it's going to be a majority of pans.

147
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,800
But let us go ahead and talk about utensils.

148
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,000
Got our chef knife, right.

149
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Beautiful cutting board, of course, and then just now near me.

150
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,000
I have a little spatula.

151
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,600
Definitely going to need that for our homemade tortillas.

152
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,000
I love to have these little tongues as well.

153
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,000
And then I just have a small amount of spoons here.

154
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:23,500
Is it going to help with pulling out any ingredients out of those packaging and just kind of make our life a little easier when we're saucing when we're putting some, you know, Salsas and ramekins, super simple.

155
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,600
Of course.

156
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,800
I have a couple Linens as well.

157
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Now you guys, if you don't have a tortilla holder too warm to keep our tortillas nice and warm.

158
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,600
While we're eating our tacos.

159
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,600
The linen will definitely work as the trick, right?

160
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,700
We're going to use It as a steamer once we have our hot tortillas.

161
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,400
So make sure you at least have an extra clean linen.

162
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,000
Alongside.

163
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,900
I am going to go ahead and bring you over to my stove here.

164
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,100
So you will see, I do have a decent amount of pans right now.

165
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,900
The saucepan in the middle here is going to be for my chicken tinga.

166
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:10,100
So make sure you guys have a small sauce pot for your chicken tinga and then I have to cast iron pans here just for my other proteins, my Carnitas and also my steak.

167
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:23,300
So for the vegetarian out there, I just like to go ahead and use a sheet tray with a little bit of foil on it, because we can actually go ahead and just roast our It's alongside our butternut squash.

168
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,400
Okay, alongside that sheet tray for my vegetarian.

169
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,100
Vegan friend.

170
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,000
You will need at least one cast, iron pan.

171
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,200
And that's going to be for your mushrooms.

172
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:40,400
Now, you will notice I have this really large, kind of flat top attachment on my stove as well.

173
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,700
Now for me, this is the best thing you can possibly use to heat up tortilla.

174
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,000
It's right.

175
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,900
We don't want to go ahead and heat up one towards he at a time.

176
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Letting it get cold in the You know, after we're cooking it, so for me, I love to be able to cook at least six tortillas on this flat top.

177
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,000
Now.

178
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,200
If you guys don't have a flat top like this, just having another large cast, iron pan will definitely do the trick.

179
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,700
All right.

180
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,900
Beautiful.

181
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,100
How's the margarita going?

182
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,400
Hopefully, no one went ahead and chugged it.

183
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,300
It is only Tuesday, but no, shame.

184
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,300
Perfect.

185
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Other than that, guy's if you were had your box in front of you, feel free to go ahead and pull out all the ingredients and just kind of neatly lined them up in front of your cooking station, makes your life a little bit easier.

186
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,400
And other than that, I think we can go ahead and is it is only Tuesday?

187
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,200
I know it looks like Friday outside plus we got it is Wednesday.

188
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,900
Oh my God, you guys are totally, right.

189
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,500
We're going to act like, it's Friday, even though it's Taco Tuesday on this Wednesday.

190
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,500
If that Sounds.

191
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,100
All right, beautiful.

192
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,900
Thank you for keeping me in check over there.

193
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,900
McCoy.

194
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,900
Definitely with the knowledge great.

195
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,300
So we do have a little protein prep just to get started beforehand.

196
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:08,300
I also would like Zachary that my loan vegetarian not to section you off, but go ahead and pre-heat your oven to 375.

197
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,500
All right, Zachary only for Zachary.

198
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,100
He is a special person in this entire group.

199
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,700
Group, and we all love him for them.

200
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,400
Great.

201
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,800
So back into our small amount of protein prep.

202
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,400
All I am going to do here.

203
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:31,200
And after the protein prep will go ahead and jump into our side rooms, but just a couple steps before we do that for my protein prep.

204
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,800
I really just want to go ahead and start getting all this meat out and be able to breathe especially the stake here.

205
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Okay, so just getting a steak right out of our compostable packaging here.

206
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,700
I am going to go ahead and just lay it on a linen.

207
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,100
Just to kind of soak up some of that liquid.

208
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,500
If you don't want to use a linen just for this, we can go ahead and just have a paper towel.

209
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,600
Will definitely do the trick.

210
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,900
Okay, I have a thousand of these Linens though.

211
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:02,300
So I have no shame in using that beautiful one protein prep down.

212
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,700
And as I did mention, these bags are 100% compostable.

213
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,900
So if you guys have little home compost, compost at your house, please, just throw them in there.

214
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,900
They will buy generally degrade.

215
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,500
Next up.

216
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,700
I am going to go ahead and just get my chicken tinga in the sauce pot.

217
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,100
Okay.

218
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,600
Now I don't want to turn on that sauce pot.

219
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,800
I just want to get it in there.

220
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:33,300
Okay, just like we said this is just a small amount of prep work before the fun really begins.

221
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,900
So right into my pot, make sure you get all of those sauces from this packaging.

222
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,400
They're so delicious.

223
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,400
Just like the squeeze out with your hands, just like that.

224
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,600
Fantastic, and then just going to put the lid back on.

225
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,900
Like I said, we're not turning on that pot just yet.

226
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
We're just getting it ready.

227
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,400
All right.

228
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,000
Now that leaves us with our Carnitas, the Carnitas can actually stay in the bag here.

229
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,400
But I am just going to go ahead and open them up.

230
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:16,900
I like to open the entire packaging up just, so we keep a nice flat surface for the Carnitas, and we will go ahead and show you why that's important a little bit later.

231
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But as you can see, just opening it up like a book.

232
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,700
Beautiful.

233
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,300
That will do the trick.

234
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,700
Here we go.

235
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,800
So now we got all our proteins, nice and prepped.

236
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:42,600
Chickens in the sauce, pot, steaks, drying out a little bit on a paper towel, Carnitas are opened up getting ready for that cook along.

237
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:49,500
Okay, so we will go ahead and just make sure you hit except on your break rooms here and I will see you guys back here in about seven minutes or so.

238
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,800
So you guys enjoy that margarita.

239
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,300
I also have a dog.

240
00:27:59,300 --> 00:27:59,700
Yes.

241
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,900
You guys are in my house today.

242
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,500
So welcome.

243
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,600
She knows.

244
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:15,200
She knows that guy that she ever belong here.

245
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,900
I love that poll.

246
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,600
By the way.

247
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,900
I also voted for whiskey.

248
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,400
So, great job everyone.

249
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,700
You guys got the right answer.

250
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,700
Beautiful.

251
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,100
Love.

252
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,300
Seeing the photos as well.

253
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,300
Everyone holding on gripping.

254
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,800
Tight to that Margarita.

255
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,500
Beautiful.

256
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,100
Love it.

257
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,500
What's I would love to see some of y'all's favorite whiskies in the chat.

258
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,600
I personally love to drink Booker's.

259
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,100
Booker's is my drink for the most part when it comes down to Whiskey.

260
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,100
Sneezy.

261
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:48,900
Good straight.

262
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
Sipping Wild Turkey 101.

263
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,400
Okay.

264
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,500
Hi.

265
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Hi West.

266
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,400
He's just a simple man.

267
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,500
Love it.

268
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,100
Great, guys.

269
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,600
Well tonight.

270
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,800
We are drinking tequila.

271
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,000
So no one should be mad about that.

272
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,100
The Margaritas are really fantastic.

273
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,100
So let us get kind of down into the grittiness of setting up our clatter.

274
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,400
Right?

275
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,700
So this is going to be called armies and place.

276
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,800
Does anyone know what Mason pluses by chance?

277
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,100
Has anyone watched the Food Network and heard that?

278
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,600
Put your answer in the chat really quickly.

279
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Let us see if I get any Put in place.

280
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,800
Yeah, pretty much.

281
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,900
That's exactly it.

282
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,200
So, we're getting everything in its place.

283
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,500
That's mise-en-place.

284
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,100
Right?

285
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:37,300
So what to means in place for this taco event is going to be, is getting are those little garnishes all those beautiful colors right on the plate first?

286
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:43,100
Okay, and the very first amazing plus, I think that we can essentially do get our prep ready is.

287
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,600
I have our 2, beautiful Salsas here and all I did was put them right into little ramekins.

288
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:55,700
Now, this is sounds like a really small step but Actually adds a lot of value to the perceived value of this ditch.

289
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,000
Right?

290
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,900
We took the time to went ahead and separate our Salsas.

291
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,800
We can use them throughout the night.

292
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,700
It looks beautiful.

293
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,100
Just nice off into their ramekins.

294
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,700
So let us go ahead and start by doing soap, right?

295
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,400
I am looking for a nice plate skills tonight.

296
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,000
Okay, and we can actually do that with just using our vision.

297
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:22,700
Having these beautiful colors that were about to display on our plate, is actually going to be kind of the plate up of this platter at itself.

298
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,700
Other than that, I am going to go ahead and grab my platter for this evening.

299
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,200
This is beautiful, nice white large plate.

300
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:39,100
It's going to have plenty of surface area for me to work with all my garnishes have all three of my All-Star meats, or All is right in the center.

301
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,000
So go ahead and find yourselves a beautiful, nice platter like this.

302
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,600
Okay, and the first thing I am going to be adding to this platter.

303
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,800
We have those pesky lines from that Margarita.

304
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,600
So I think, let us go ahead and just finish the job.

305
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,100
Right?

306
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,900
We have about three quarters of a margarita.

307
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,500
We have our knife and let us just go ahead and create the rest into wedges here.

308
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,800
Like so beautiful.

309
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:13,500
No, Taco is complete without a nice fresh Spritz of that line.

310
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,400
It's right there.

311
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And I am just going to start playing with colors here.

312
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,800
I think we should go ahead and do for the most part.

313
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,300
All of our knife work.

314
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,500
Now here.

315
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,300
I have my market vegetables.

316
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:35,200
These are going to be just fresh seasonal, vegetables, that freshness of the vegetable actually gives a lot of texture to a taco.

317
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,600
I love the little bite of a radish and between some carnitas.

318
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,900
So let us go ahead and attack that.

319
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,400
So just slicing off the top of the package.

320
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,600
These vegetables have already been pre-washed for you.

321
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:57,700
So you can see I have a little yellow carrot and also this just beautiful cherry bomb of a radish are so using my fingertips here.

322
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,400
I am going to actually claw the item.

323
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,000
Now.

324
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,100
I don't want anyone.

325
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:09,600
We're going to do a little pre lesson on how to properly cut something as you can see on a professional chef and I have all 10.

326
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,800
And my fingers, still tell you, I know what I am talking about, right?

327
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,200
So when I cut anything, I am always clawing the Mmm, usually, with these three fingers here.

328
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,100
Okay, so I am gripping it.

329
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:31,700
And as you can tell, when I grip it, my Knuckles kind of protrude out word, which allows me to kind of rest, my knife amongst my Knuckles.

330
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:39,500
And as you can see, my fingertips will naturally kind of push inward being hidden from my knife blade itself.

331
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,300
So let us think a little smart here as well.

332
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,400
This thing rolls around like crazy.

333
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,000
So let us go ahead and give it some nice.

334
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Flat edges.

335
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,200
Nice flat surface to work on.

336
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,300
This looks like a nice little heart.

337
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,100
Let us hear you guys.

338
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,500
There we go, beautiful.

339
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,200
So now we have a, we have a flat surface radish.

340
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,700
My fingertips are gripping.

341
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:08,700
The item Knuckles are, protruding outward firm grip on my knife.

342
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:17,900
And I am just slicing right through and a rocking motion, until I meet an apex in which my reddish is no longer.

343
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:24,300
A safe kind of on this Edge, so I am a tilted back down and then just attack the other side.

344
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,100
Definitely not a race.

345
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,400
We want nice thin slices a vegetable here, okay.

346
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,200
Beautiful.

347
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,300
Now, we kind of made it a little easier ready for you with the carrot.

348
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,000
It's got a nice flat surface.

349
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,500
And for me, I like these to kind of mimic the size of the taco.

350
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,000
So I am going to go ahead and cut them at a diagonal bias.

351
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,700
So they're a little larger, and they just fit nicely onto my taco.

352
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,900
So just like that.

353
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,200
A nice little sweetness from the carrot, alongside its texture.

354
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,600
And the crunch makes her a really nice little taco garnish.

355
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,100
So here we just have our beautiful little bundle.

356
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,900
Showing off those knife skills.

357
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,600
Everyone's got their finger tips.

358
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,300
I hope.

359
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,200
And we're going to roll.

360
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,400
But look at that already.

361
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:22,500
The color of these to the grain from the line, the beautiful carrot alongside the radish, makes this look really beautiful.

362
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:30,000
Now, let us go ahead and finish off a little of this knife work here and I think we're going to do some of this charred onion here.

363
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,600
Slicing it rights?

364
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,700
Open like that.

365
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:39,400
Now you will notice on this onion itself, the root system is still attached.

366
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,400
So just this little button, has the roots still attached.

367
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,200
All we want to do is slice that off.

368
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,200
Don't want to eat that.

369
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,100
Using that same technique.

370
00:42:51,100 --> 00:43:01,300
I am gripping these onion, this onion here, and I am just going to make small little ribbon, so I can go ahead and put this throughout my taco of my choosing.

371
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,800
Beautiful.

372
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,000
Fun.

373
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,200
This right back to our platter.

374
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,500
Love the translucent color.

375
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,400
Fantastic.

376
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,900
Now I am going to go ahead and reach for my chili Tori.

377
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:34,400
Ah, do so, anyone know what a chili Tory Auto is Can anyone guess what pepper this is in this package?

378
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,000
I know there're some Californians out there.

379
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,900
So they definitely know what this is here.

380
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:48,700
I just got a nice, beautiful charred jalapeno and which we then quick pickle with a little lime juice.

381
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,900
Okay, so it's got that dark bite from the grill.

382
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,000
It's got that acidic punch to it from the lime.

383
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,200
And I am just going to strike off the stem.

384
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,300
Now, if you guys don't like the spiciness of this jalapeno, all too much.

385
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,300
We can go ahead and de-seed it from the inside.

386
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:18,800
So, just slicing the center open, not all the way through, but just enough to expose those seeds, you can use the back of your knife.

387
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,200
To just scrape nice and easily out like so.

388
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,200
For me, I like the chili.

389
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:34,200
So I am going to go ahead and put them right back in, and I am just going to slice nice, beautiful wedges of this jalapeno.

390
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,000
Fantastic, nice hatch, stick.

391
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:44,400
And I am going to rest that directly right on top of my onions.

392
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,600
Let us see where you guys are at.

393
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,100
Okay, beautiful head on a swivel.

394
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:56,700
Love it.

395
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,600
Someone's thinking on their feet.

396
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,100
That's a true.

397
00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,700
Chef move.

398
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,300
Great job.

399
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:07,400
So here, just to show you what I am working with so far, have a couple of my garnishes.

400
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,200
Now.

401
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,700
Let us add a little more brightness to this, right?

402
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,300
It's kind of getting a little mold down with these charred, vegetable garnishes with the onion and the jalapeno.

403
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,100
What I want you guys to go ahead and reach for next is what's called.

404
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,100
Need pack that you need.

405
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,600
Peck is a very traditional Yucatan style garnish.

406
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:41,400
You often find these on tostadas and Tacos, but the thing that's so special about SHINee, Peck is the pickling liquid, which usually tends to be vinegar, has been swapped out for citrus juices.

407
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:52,900
So, in this, we have pickled it with orange juice, lime juice, and a little habanero pieces, just to give it a nice kick and it's got some good sweetness from those juices themselves.

408
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,000
And you can just see the color of it is just absolutely stunning.

409
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,900
So, just using your fingertips, we're here to get messy.

410
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:02,800
Kind of drain.

411
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,500
These onions?

412
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,600
Right out.

413
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,900
These are some of my favorite garnishes for a steak taco.

414
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,600
So beautiful.

415
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,100
It's like that.

416
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:25,200
So you can see how I am actually using the rim of my plate, to really set the boundary for all of our garnishes.

417
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,000
Right?

418
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,900
So we're thinking the little smart here and then next up.

419
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,000
I am going to go ahead and reach for some fresh cilantro.

420
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,900
Let us live in this thing up with a little more fresh herbs here, okay.

421
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:43,500
Now just a couple more steps before we do break off into your breakout rooms once more.

422
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,000
So really take the time to set off these garnishes really beautifully.

423
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,900
Feel free to take a couple of those photos once you guys are in there, but just grabbing the cilantro.

424
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,200
It's already been picked for you.

425
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,200
We did the hard stuff.

426
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,600
It's already been washed.

427
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,000
So just give it a little volume, right?

428
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,200
But something's nice and Tall on a play.

429
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,900
It just speaks so much louder.

430
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,500
Look so much more beautiful.

431
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,400
And now, pair them with our house bar herbs.

432
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,900
This is just from a local hyper local Farm here in Austin Texas.

433
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,000
That grows these beautiful little field herbs.

434
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800
Now, not only do they just look gorgeous.

435
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,200
They really do add a lot of different flavors.

436
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:34,100
Now if you have any large pieces like this, Malabar spinach here, feel free to just pick it with your fingers, tear it up into some bite-sized pieces.

437
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,500
Those flowers are edible.

438
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,000
They just give a nice little beautiful.

439
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,500
Look to your plate.

440
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,000
Here we go.

441
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,300
Now, I am starting to get a little more green on my plate.

442
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,500
So, let us go ahead and lighten up the mood.

443
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,800
We have this beautiful quesillo.

444
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,200
They will.

445
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,900
Haka that we get imported at the restaurant.

446
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,600
Every single Friday, from Oaxaca.

447
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:13,400
This is the most insanely delicious cheese you have ever had the way that it's made is that it's stretched and continuously stretched and balled up into a nice large ball.

448
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,900
So here we have those Strands of it.

449
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:24,000
So just pick it with your fingers, definitely snag a little piece for the enjoyment, pre taco.

450
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,900
But this on top of the chicken tinga just makes it so delicious.

451
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,200
So here we go.

452
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,500
And then that leaves me with our last garnish here, which is this avocado.

453
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:49,800
So, the avocado is bagged because we went ahead and just slice the avocado down the middle, just to make sure you guys are getting a nice, beautiful, non bruised, avocado.

454
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:57,400
So once we slice it, we sealed it right back up as if it was brand-new and it is absolutely fantastic.

455
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,400
You will notice the seed is still in the avocado that helps.

456
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,200
The my stay oxidation of it.

457
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,700
So for the last kind of knife work prep.

458
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,700
We have we just have to deep it.

459
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,400
This avocado seed.

460
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,200
Gently striking the center of the avocado with your middle of your knife.

461
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,500
Get in there.

462
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,000
Counter twist both hands.

463
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,600
Beautiful.

464
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,500
Thing is right out.

465
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,700
Now.

466
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,500
I love to cut this on The Cutting Board.

467
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:33,500
Now.

468
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,300
You don't ever need to buy an avocado Spooner right?

469
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:37,700
Or what?

470
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,900
I don't even know what it's called.

471
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,700
I just have this nice antique spoon here that I found perfect for my avocados.

472
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,900
So I am just going to use the spoon to scoop out that beautiful flesh.

473
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,300
Bright and vibrant green.

474
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,400
This avocado.

475
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,800
It's one of my favorite garnishes.

476
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:12,500
Fantastic, and I am just going to go ahead and cut little wedges on a bias like so, For Allah, you can press down, give it that nice fan.

477
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:19,100
Look at that beautiful green eggs, just like that.

478
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,300
Clean up the station, just a little bit.

479
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,500
I know.

480
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,000
Hey, we're here to prove you guys wrong on that shipping of avocados.

481
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,100
It is possible.

482

We have the technology.

483
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,900

Definitely encourage drinking while we're eating these tacos.

507
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:04,600
I saw everyone's super amazing job now.

508
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,200
It's on to the cooking part, right?

509
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,300
The very most important thing about cooking is proper.

510
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,300
On our pans or oven, right?

511
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,500
So we need to make sure these pans are nice and hot.

512
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,700
This is why I love to use cast iron.

513
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:24,900
It retains its heat much, much better than most pans, and it's also really simple to clean out.

514
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,400
You rinse it, wipe it out.

515
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,500
With a paper towel.

516
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,100
It just keeps on getting better.

517
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,400
The seasoning on the pan itself grows with you while you're kind of cooking.

518
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:37,300
So the first thing I want to do come with me to my range here.

519
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,700
Zachary, you got your oven on?

520
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,700
Yes, sir.

521
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,400
Great.

522
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,500
So our oven on is for our vegetarian option.

523
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,400
Mr. Exact.

524
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,000
Everyone else should be working with this.

525
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,300
These pans here.

526
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:50,800
Okay.

527
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,600
So for me, the very first thing, we have our chicken tinga in our sauce pot.

528
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:01,300
I am going to go ahead and start that first, and I am going to turn it on very low.

529
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,900
I just want a nice simmer on my chicken tinga.

530
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,700
I don't want to reduce my sauce.

531
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,400
In there all that much.

532
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,300
I just really want to warm up this chicken.

533
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:11,800
Okay.

534
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:22,000
So the very first thing we're going kind of reverse, little Seer here, chicken tinga on low heat with my other pans.

535
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,300
I am going to go ahead and turn on my tortilla pan.

536
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,900
So this will be your largest pan.

537
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And I also want this on low.

538
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,800
So by time or mates are nice and Cooked.

539
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:44,300
Our tortilla pan will be nice and ready just to warm up these House made Tortillas, okay, and that leaves me with my two solo pants here.

540
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:51,900
One for my carnitas, one, for my steak, now, Zachary with a vegetarian option.

541
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,400
One of these pans will go ahead and be for our mushrooms.

542
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:55,900
Okay.

543
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,400
So here we have the mon.

544
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,200
I am going to go ahead and start preheating.

545
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,200
My pans to just under medium heat.

546
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,800
I want a nice and hot.

547
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,900
But I don't want to really burn down the place, right?

548
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,000
So let us just get that going, beautiful.

549
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,800
This is a nice little Pro tip as well.

550
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,800
As you can see that, I have a bunch of items cooking.

551
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,300
Now.

552
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:25,700
I am always very cautious that I have my handles of my pans, kind of facing the same way.

553
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,200
Right?

554
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,700
And I never want those handles to be in front of the stove.

555
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,200
Just in case you got a kid running around that dog.

556
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,500
Is maybe pulling up here.

557
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,100
They're going to knock this thing.

558
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:40,600
I am always having my pans, just consciously in a single Direction, okay.

559
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,700
So now that our pans are starting to warm up.

560
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,100
Once again on that Medium.

561
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:55,100
I am going to grab that neutral oil that we sent you and I want half of that neutral oil and to each of your pants.

562
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,600
Okay, just like that.

563
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:01,800
Now, this neutral oil has a higher smoke point.

564
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:12,200
That smoke point is going to allow us to get a hotter temperature on her oil which is going to have us have a better texture on our Carnitas are Steak, right?

565
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:16,900
So I want you guys to keep a close eye on your pans.

566
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:23,000
Not looking for a billowing of smoke, but just a small little faint hint of smoke.

567
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
That's the pan saying hey, I am here to party.

568
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,700
Let us get it going.

569
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:33,500
Okay, now for Zach with our vegetarian, I am going to go ahead and jump on that for a moment.

570
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,700
I am going to go ahead and open up our me so grilled carrots.

571
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:38,500
Right here.

572
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,300
We have that and then I have our sweet potato.

573
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,000
That's been part roasted.

574
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,100
Okay, both of these packages are now open.

575
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,100
We're going to go ahead and grab my sheet tray.

576
01:04:52,600 --> 01:05:03,900
Now Zach feel free to go ahead and salt Tay these vegetables instead if you want a little more live action, but for me, I just like to kind of continue to roast them.

577
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,700
So one side is going to have my beautiful.

578
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:07,900
It's on there.

579
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,600
The other my sweet potato.

580
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:19,200
And now that neutral oil, instead of using it on the pan, Zachary go ahead and just sprinkle a little bit directly on top.

581
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:26,100
Beautiful, and I am going to go straight into the oven with these vegetables.

582
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,400
It's like that.

583
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,800
And on that last three minute cook for these vegetables.

584
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:38,100
I am going to actually switch the oven to the broil setting which is going to cook from the above.

585
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,100
Point of the stove.

586
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:44,300
It's going to give a nice color to those carrots and those sweet potatoes in there.

587
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:44,600
Okay?

588
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:51,500
Back to my mate folk garnishes on our plate, polish off to the side.

589
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:58,300
I am going to probably start with my stake here because it's going to need to rest after we cook it.

590
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,600
So we have the oil in the pan.

591
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,500
It's on medium Heat.

592
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,000
Going to be there in about 20 seconds, for sure.

593
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:11,200
Now, when I grab my piece of steak, And this is the pan.

594
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:11,600
Imagine.

595
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,700
This is the pan here.

596
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,300
I am going to lay the steak, just the tip of it.

597
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,000
In the pan must hear the sizzle.

598
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,600
And if you're not hearing the sizzle, pull it right out.

599
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:23,800
Just wait a little bit.

600
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,000
Let us see.

601
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,700
Let me answer a question really quick.

602
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,700
That grape seed is not olive oil.

603
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:35,500
Olive oil is not actually the best oil to use for sauteing items because it has a really low smoke point.

604
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:40,000
So when you're sautéing something really hot and olive oil, you're burning the olive oil.

605
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,700
And we have all probably seen, how all of oil can get $25 a bottle.

606
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,700
You're kind of just wasting money when you're sautéing and olive oil.

607
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:53,600
Now, Italian recipes, I am Italian, do call for sweating things and olive oil.

608
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,200
And that's just a really shallow kind of low heat.

609
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,600
So this is actually grapeseed oil.

610
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:07,200
But what we got going on with the steak, want to hear the sizzle, and then we're going to drop away from us.

611
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,000
So that oil doesn't potentially splatter on.

612
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:10,600
To us.

613
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,400
Do you recommend turning on the vent Hood?

614
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,900
It might get a little hot in here.

615
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,600
And my pan looks nice and ready.

616
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:27,400
So, starting with that steak can see the oil, the viscosity is, it has totally changed?

617
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,700
Great Sizzle, definitely get that mic in their beautiful.

618
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,000
And I am setting it away from me.

619
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:35,100
Now.

620
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:41,200
We're going to cook that steak for about a minute to two minutes on this side and flip it.

621
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,400
Okay, so get those tongues ready.

622
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:52,300
Now, this steak is to be prepared, kind of medium rare, which is the best way to enjoy it in my opinion.

623
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:52,700
Now.

624
01:07:52,700 --> 01:08:00,400
If you do want to have a medium to, well, steak go ahead and add a minute, to a minute, and a half on that cook time on each of these sides.

625
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:00,800
Okay.

626
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,600
So, our steak is rolling.

627
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,600
Which means we're about ready for our Carnitas.

628
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:21,399
Now, we left our Carnitas in this nice Flat state because we want all this surface area to caramelize this layer of Carnitas before we really begin to represent Italians.

629
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:24,899
Yeah, then, you know, sorry reading the chat.

630
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:30,200
We want this surface area to carmelites and really fry in its own fat.

631
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,100
So going to remove that plastic.

632
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:37,300
Back to my pan, viscosity of the oil is beautiful.

633
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:41,100
It's going to lay it in there, and I am not even going to touch it.

634
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:48,000
We're going to cook that for about two minutes and allow it to really fry and its own rendered fat, okay.

635
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,600
Beautiful.

636
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,500
Now Zachary with your mushrooms.

637
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,000
Here.

638
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,899
We can do the same with the pan and getting it, nice and hot.

639
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,300
And then we're really simply just going to saute these bad boys, okay.

640
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,100
So sauteing them should hear the sizzle.

641
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:18,300
Once the oil is nice and hot, add the mushrooms and then kind of just let them cool out and cook for about a minute before we really begin to stir them.

642
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:18,600
Right?

643
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,100
Because we want that caramelization.

644
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,300
We want that color on those mushrooms.

645
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:31,300
Let us see, any other questions about neutral oil.

646
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:31,700
Nope.

647
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,000
Neutral oil is just really cheap.

648
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,399
Honestly, for me personally.

649
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,100
I use neutral oil for every cooking, pretty much procedure.

650
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:49,200
And that's like I said, it's for like a specific recipe and which I am using olive oil to kind of sweat and embed those onions and baby carrots with some of that olive oil flavor.

651
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,100
But yeah grapeseed oil which is the neutral Oil.

652
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:56,600
We're using super cheap and it gets better product out of it.

653
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:57,000
Yep.

654
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
High Point.

655
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,800
So, smart used avocado as well.

656
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,200
That's also a great neutral oil.

657
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:04,900
Beautiful.

658
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,300
So just showing you guys my stake here.

659
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,000
It's been about 2 minutes.

660
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,100
I am going to go ahead and flip it over.

661
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:18,200
It's got this nice dark caramelization on it that dark Amber red.

662
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:22,600
And so another 2 minutes on this side should do the trick.

663
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,900
And then once that two minutes is up directly from my pan.

664
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:32,400
I am just going to come and rest my steak on my cutting board, right?

665
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,300
Fantastic, so it's been a couple of minutes.

666
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:40,800
My Carnitas are quite literally popping off right now, which is a great, great sign.

667
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:49,600
If they're popping a little bit too much, you can go ahead and turn down the heat, but let us look at some of this great color.

668
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,300
We got.

669
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,500
Yeah, the caramelization definitely happening.

670
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:56,200
Beautiful.

671
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,500
Going to go ahead and mix in that kind of fried.

672
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,000
Consistent Carnitas.

673
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,700
Let us take a look at our chicken tinga, beautiful.

674
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,100
Small reduce just give it a good stir.

675
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,100
So that's been another minute or two on my steak.

676
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:26,000
So I am going to go ahead and turn off the heat on my steak going to bring that over to my cutting board.

677
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,300
Let that thing, rest.

678
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,200
For exact Curry's pleasure.

679
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:39,900
I am going to go ahead and just saute my mushrooms in that cast iron pan.

680
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,100
It's got some great color.

681
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:47,600
Beautiful.

682
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,700
So, the mmm does anyone know the importance of letting?

683
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,100
The steak rests.

684
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,100
What do you guys think is happening, you know, cooking is so much for me.

685
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:05,000
I really begun to excel in my career when I began to really observe quite literally what's just happening.

686
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,200
This is an applied science in my opinion, which makes this entire, you know, room of your house.

687
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:14,600
A living laboratory, which makes it so much more fun to really get in the kitchen.

688
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,800
Get your hands on some ingredients and cook.

689
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,700
So let us say yeah, the juices.

690
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:23,700
Exactly.

691
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,700
So think about it, right.

692
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:29,600
We just expose this meet a lot of heat, which is opening up pores, right?

693
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,100
Ladies.

694
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,800
And I mean my skin routine at nighttime jump out of the shower.

695
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:39,100
My pores are freaking size of pepperonis that heat is just expanding them open.

696
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,000
So all that poor in the stake.

697
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,500
Here is expanding, once we take it back to that cold State outside of the pan.

698
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,200
It's going to shrivel.

699
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,900
Back up sucking in all those juices, right?

700
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,600
Beautiful.

701
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,100
So sauteing some mushrooms, getting some great color.

702
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,800
These pork carnitas definitely popping, which is great.

703
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,300
Got some great caramelization.

704
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:10,300
You can see all the extra fat that's just been rendered from the pork itself.

705
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:19,300
I am actually going to go ahead and turn my pan off just because they look nice and golden, but I want these Carnitas to go ahead and just remain in the pan.

706
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,400
My chicken tinga looks nice and hot thoroughly all throughout.

707
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,500
So, I as well, we will turn that off.

708
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:36,000
And at this point Zach, let us go ahead and probably turn that oven to that broil State just for about a minute or two.

709
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:42,800
Just to give it a final color on our, our mushroom or excuse me, our carrots, and our sweet potatoes.

710
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,100
So let us do that real quick.

711
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Perfect.

712
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,700
Do a little wipe down at the station.

713
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,400
Now, our meats are nice and hot.

714
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,100
They're beautifully caramelized.

715
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,700
Our steak is resting.

716
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:09,500
The last thing we need to be doing our next thing, we should be doing preparing our tortillas.

717
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,500
So through the company to MOA.

718
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:23,100
We buy literally about two tons of dried corn every 6 months and this corn comes from different areas, all throughout Mexico.

719
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,600
Absolutely, beautiful.

720
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:26,800
You will notice here.

721
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,000
I have these Pink House made Tortillas.

722
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:34,400
Now the elevation that all of these different pieces of corn.

723
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:40,200
Growing really alter the change in the way you cook these tortillas in general.

724
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,000
So just taking them out of the bag.

725
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:48,300
I am going to separate the tortillas from the paper recyclable.

726
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,000
Just like that.

727
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,200
We're letting them breathe.

728
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:00,800
And we already was smart enough to go ahead and turn on our tortilla pan.

729
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:05,300
Some really warming these things up, should take no time at all.

730
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:22,300
Beautiful, and just want to mention, I did turn off all of my heat sources on my pans, and I am letting those items stay in the pan just to stay warm until we really hit the plate with them.

731
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:22,700
Okay.

732
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,800
So I have my clean linen here.

733
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,200
Wrong one here.

734
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,300
It is beautiful.

735
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:34,000
So I am just going to take this over to my workstation are my Kamal.

736
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,100
I have this beautiful little tiny spatula.

737
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:38,700
Absolutely.

738
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,100
Love it.

739
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,400
Thank you, Central Market.

740
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:45,500
And nice and hot pan already just nice and warm.

741
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,000
No oil is needed whatsoever.

742
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,700
There's plenty of natural oil in this tortilla.

743
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,000
Now.

744
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,700
The only thing that should ever be in your corn.

745
01:15:54,700 --> 01:16:00,200
Tortilla is dried corn, obviously, water and salt.

746
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:10,800
So this is a natural gluten-free, you know, vegan option for tacos and it makes the best tacos in the world must be made from fresh.

747
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:19,400
Massa, I am just going to go ahead and cook these for 30 seconds on each side.

748
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,300
Beautiful.

749
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,400
Definitely have my dog started to come and circle around like a shark.

750
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,100
She's psycho.

751
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,300
She definitely her favorite.

752
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,600
Taco is probably the steak carnitas.

753
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:38,400
Yeah.

754
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:44,600
She's looking at me like she said and hasn't eaten dinner, but she got well-fed beforehand.

755
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:46,900
Beautiful.

756
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:55,200
So as you can see my tortillas 30 seconds on each side, this is Master Level Kemal work.

757
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,100
When you can do it with your fingertips here.

758
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,500
And like I said, these are already totally cooked for you.

759
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,200
So all we got to do is really warm them up.

760
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:17,600
So right into my Fresh Linen, it's going to act as a steamer, right?

761
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:22,000
So here just going to place my Fresh Tortillas.

762
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,300
If they inflate on you.

763
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,500
That's just a really amazing great sign that it's a Fresh Tortilla.

764
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,200
And then redo the steps here.

765
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,700
Make sure you close that linen.

766
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:39,700
We want to keep that heat Source inside, right?

767
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:47,100
Do you guys smell the natural kind of oils being released from these tortillas, as we're cooking?

768
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,800
It's kind of like toasting bread, right?

769
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,000
We don't necessarily so proud.

770
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:52,400
Jesse.

771
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,200
I am proud of you.

772
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,000
It should be smelling amazing and everyone's house right now.

773
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,200
Take a look at my vegetable Zack.

774
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,800
We don't want to forget about that.

775
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,800
That Broiler does work fast.

776
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,600
Just a small amount of color tortillas or coming too long.

777
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:14,900
Beautiful.

778
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:23,000
So add to our pile here, people are start to be coming out of y'all's house.

779
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,200
Like y'all didn't even know was there right?

780
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:30,600
Y'all guess this past weekend watching, some footballs guarantee at they're still over waiting for some tacos.

781
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:42,600
So right into my stack, some more hot tortillas going to just fold over my tortillas and put them on a nice plate.

782
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,700
Remember this presentation is everything.

783
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:52,100
I mean, how beautiful is it when we just have a nice little blanket of sleeping tortillas like that.

784
01:18:54,500 --> 01:19:02,500
Fantastic guys, so close to that final and first bite of heaven.

785
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,600
So now we have our station, right?

786
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,700
All our Foods hot here.

787
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,800
We are getting ready to Plate.

788
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:10,500
Now.

789
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:16,800
We have our code, you steak on the counter, aren't on our cutting board here.

790
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:20,600
Looks nice and delicious.

791
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,700
You can see all those beautiful juices being sucked back in.

792
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,400
Now, you can see the striation of the meat, right?

793
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,800
And here's a pro tip for you guys.

794
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,200
We always want to cut our meat against the grain.

795
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,200
We don't want to chew with the grain.

796
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:38,900
We want our mouth to, you know, cut through the meat itself.

797
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:47,000
So find where those long strands of kind of caramelized meet go, and we're going to cut opposite of it.

798
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:53,600
So here, I am just cutting nice, beautiful, traditional little fajita ribbons.

799
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:59,700
This will be the first item to hit our plate here.

800
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,400
Like I said, beautiful medium rare.

801
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,100
Absolutely beautiful for me.

802
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,900
I like to just use my knife and kind of hatch.

803
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,100
Stick them like that.

804
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,200
We're going to go right in the center.

805
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,400
Our platter.

806
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,000
Maybe for you.

807
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:20,400
Zach.

808
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:26,700
This is the carrots to match kind of the length, beautiful already.

809
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:28,500
And then next up.

810
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,400
I am going to go ahead and divide it with my chicken tinga.

811
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,000
For having one of these spoons here.

812
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,600
Super Saucy.

813
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,800
This adobo Chipotle blend.

814
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,000
That just coats.

815
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,800
All of this chicken just makes it.

816
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:52,200
Absolutely amazing smells so good.

817
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,100
Make sure you get all that sauce from that pan.

818
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:03,100
And I am just going to finish with my absolutely beautiful Carnitas.

819
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,200
Now, for me.

820
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:11,200
The best tool is going to be the tongs because there is a decent amount of that rendered fat still.

821
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:14,700
So just give a nice dripping on top of your plate.

822
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:17,600
Oh, yeah.

823
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:22,200
Guys, I am salivating so bad right now.

824
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,600
It's hard for me to talk.

825
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:27,500
Oh Lord.

826
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,800
This is unfair that we get to eat this way.

827
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,200
Seriously guys.

828
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,000
Fluff up some of those herbs.

829
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,900
Let us get our beautiful platter coming back together.

830
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:41,600
Strong.

831
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,400
Introduce these beautiful Salsas.

832
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,400
Look at this spread, good Lord.

833
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,300
Here we have it.

834
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,900
He will even get a little Margarita left.

835
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:00,700
Look at that.

836
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:01,700
So guys.

837
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:05,600
Once you're at this point, we're going to jump again into another breakout room.

838
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,100
Of course.

839
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,000
I want to hear.

840
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,100
I am going to eat a taco with you guys.

841
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,300
I want to hear any questions.

842
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:11,900
You guys have.

843
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,000
Oh my God, Emily.

844
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,500
Can we get Emily hired for assembly here?

845
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,900
I need some help on these events.

846
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:22,600
All right, that looks freaking amazing.

847
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
She's got my vote.

848
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
By the way, if there's a winner for this, I am sorry, everyone else.

849
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
She beat ya will to it.

850
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,100
Emily seems to have won this contest.

851
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:37,900
Are you food?

852
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,800
Are you actually like a food stylist on Instagram or something or no?

853
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:46,300
But you missed and we all did beyond that.

854
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:57,300
It's giving you guys a hard time for not having all the like plating, but I think it turned out.

855
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,600
I love The Cutting Board.

856
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,700
It looks amazing for that Final Touch.

857
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:02,500
No, Emily here.

858
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,500
I want you to do this live with me, right?

859
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,400
Go ahead and grab them.

860
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,400
Maldon salt.

861
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,400
We sent you yet.

862
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,500
We got to get our salt day on.

863
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:11,800
All right.

864
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:15,600
So maldon, salt is going to be a larger flake salt.

865
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,200
Right?

866
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:24,900
So, the reason we put this on at the very end is because we want to tie in all these intense flavors at the very top-level, right?

867
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,000
So when we get that salt just on top.

868
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,400
Oh wait, use your hands.

869
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,000
There we go.

870
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,300
Yeah, beautiful.

871
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:36,400
So we're always seasoning from above because we want to capture as much surface.

872
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,600
This area right as possible.

873
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:42,800
We don't want real small pinches of salt, all over the place.

874
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:46,000
We want to sporadic almost like a shotgun blast, right?

875
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,200
All of that, seasoning, right onto the plate.

876
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,000
Fantastic, everyone do yourself a, get it going on.

877
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:52,400
All right.

878
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,000
Amazing.

879
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,600
Hopefully, it smells great.

880
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,700
All these plates are looking fabulous.

881
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:13,000
Fantastic, we're definitely going to have to post some of these on our Instagram and my Instagram is well, I would love that.

882
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,100
Producer throwing on Instagram in the chat.

883
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:27,200
Hopefully everyone's coming to the fruition of their platter being assembled Zachary house.

884
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,800
The house the vegetarian coming along.

885
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:41,900
Should get some nice color on the butternut squash or excuse me in this, sweet potatoes as carrots should have a nice Grill touch to them as well.

886
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,900
Perfect out.

887
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,000
He's already finished.

888
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,800
Those mushrooms are, I wish everyone could have those mushrooms.

889
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:59,100
So, in the mushroom mixture, we add with called wila coche.

890
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:04,600
Now, we get this also weekly and this is going to be a raw corn truffle.

891
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,300
Unfortunately.

892
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:13,700
We don't get this raw beautiful product in the States because of our corn being so genetically modified, which is a whole other issue.

893
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:17,900
That's the whole thing, but you're able to enjoy that real authentic.

894
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:22,000
Fresh probably a new ingredient that you have been having fourth, which is amazing.

895
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:25,700
Man, all right.

896
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:26,900
I am a dive in on a Taco.

897
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,300
This is been staring at me too much.

898
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:32,000
What's the consensus?

899
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:32,600
What is everyone?

900
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,500
Starting with carnitas steak Tanga?

901
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,200
Let us see what they got going on.

902
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,300
I think I might I am just it's probably eating right now.

903
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,700
So they can't take things in, right?

904
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,400
That's fair.

905
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,500
Everyone's Max are going to be all greased up.

906
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,100
Yeah, right.

907
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,800
Wow, Lee.

908
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,600
That's a gorgeous plate.

909
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,300
Look at that.

910
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,100
Andrew.

911
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,700
Very nice.

912
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,600
Jesse beautiful, man.

913
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,600
These plates are gorgeous.

914
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,700
So let us start dropping in some questions.

915
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:12,400
We have got a few questions here in QA with Linda's.

916
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,500
First question.

917
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:18,700
Okay, Chef, what is neutral oil?

918
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:26,600
Yeah, so neutral oil, as we said before, is a neutral oil.

919
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,600
It doesn't have a very Bold Flavor like olive oil does, right?

920
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,800
Because olive oil is made of Olives.

921
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:45,100
It tastes like all this neutral oil is just kind of plain Bland Flavor now, I don't want to say Bland and a negative term because to me, it does technically have a flavor for instance.

922
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:50,400
I use it to pop popcorn and I really love the flavor of grapeseed on my popcorn.

923
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,300
Which I guess I am just weird about that.

924
01:26:52,300 --> 01:27:12,900
I am not sure but this oil allows you to heat up your pan a little higher than other oils, like olive oil allowing you to get a better texture on your food without burning that oil which could potentially, you know contaminate and make your food taste a little bitter, you know an onslaught of things.

925
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,000
Good question though.

926
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:14,900
Gotcha.

927
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:20,300
So is are there particular oils that are considered neutral?

928
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:44,900
Yeah, so I use grape seed oil, grapeseed oil is my favorite oil to use for cooking when it comes to sauteing our, you know, like shallow frying, something olive oil more, so for salad dressings, or finishing a pasta, so you're not, you know, really abusing the oil on its temperature, but we're actually using it for the flavor of the oil itself.

929
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:58,900
And then of course, like shortening for frying, even higher smoke point, so, Able to you know, fry things at 400 degrees getting that super text crispy texture on wings, you know, tater tots things like that.

930
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:03,700
Is canola oil, considered neutral and was Askin?

931
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,300
Yes, technically I use canola more.

932
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:12,500
So for frying, just because it does have a higher caloric intake, right?

933
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:16,700
And if you're frying, something like might as well just take it all.

934
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:17,100
Anyway.

935
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:23,200
So yeah, I use canola a little bit more for frying, really, really love grape seed.

936
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:26,900
Oil for my main use of personal cooking.

937
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:28,700
Good to note.

938
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,400
All right, we got a question from Ali.

939
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:36,000
Could you remind us which toppings are supposed to pair with, which proteins?

940
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:44,700
Every year, every topping goes with all of these proteins, honestly, we're inviting you to kind of figure out your own blend, right?

941
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:58,700
So for me, as you can see, I really love the salsa verde with the Carnitas and just avocado, but that's not to say that you shouldn't try the salsa verde with the chicken and, you know, carrots.

942
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,900
It's all really just for you to explore.

943
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:05,000
We give you a decent amount of these tortillas.

944
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,100
So you're really having a full deck to play.

945
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,500
But yeah, just figure out what your favorite combination.

946
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:11,400
Like.

947
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:17,300
I love the steak and the SHINee Peck together, but that's not technically the exact way.

948
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:18,900
We encourage you guys to eat it.

949
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:25,000
So play along, feel free to dive in on different garnishes until you figure out your favorite.

950
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,800
Another question here from Danielle.

951
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,800
Do you prefer a flavored Marg or a classic?

952
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,900
A flavored.

953
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:36,300
Yeah.

954
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,800
Here in Austin, Texas.

955
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,900
I feel like I live on that Tex-Mex aisle off South First Street here.

956
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:45,900
So for me mango frozen.

957
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:56,700
Margarita is just like, you know, just hits it a different spot than a, just a traditional line, but I really love just a nice traditional one on the Rocks.

958
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:57,000
Yeah.

959
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,000
Nice.

960
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,900
Emily's all about the spicy bars.

961
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:03,600
Honestly, that's the thing for me is, I don't necessarily like The Salt Room.

962
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,600
Interesting.

963
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,600
Alright, well, we're opening it up.

964
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:16,900
If anyone wants to jump on stage and show us your plate or your empty playing or just come on up and ask a question to Chef.

965
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,500
You're welcome to Joey.

966
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,300
Yes.

967
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,400
I agreed Sean.

968
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,500
That plate, looks amazing.

969
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:33,900
I hope half of that is gone already, but this is a video to delicious everyone's off chowing down there.

970
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,900
Down anyone who wanted to shout down with us on stage?

971
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,100
I am only a taco by tense.

972
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:42,500
Okay.

973
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:45,100
If not, oh, here we go.

974
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:45,900
Andrews.

975
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:47,700
He's intrigued.

976
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,300
Alexis is getting right off the stove.

977
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:51,900
Got it.

978
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:54,100
That is the my, a professional chef move.

979
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:55,100
You can possibly do.

980
01:30:55,100 --> 01:31:00,100
I do that twice a day, three days on our three times on Sunday.

981
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:02,200
I guarantee it like that is such a chef thing.

982
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,000
So wait and be right in line with me.

983
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:05,600
Good job.

984
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,300
Alexis you want to come on stage?

985
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:11,300
He said you're confused about how people were plating.

986
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,200
Well, we will invite you with totally up to you.

987
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:16,900
If you want to join us.

988
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:18,300
I in the meantime.

989
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:21,400
Andrew, is down to jump on up.

990
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,200
Hello, Andrew.

991
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,400
Hey, how's it going?

992
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:25,600
I have got my tortilla.

993
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,300
Nice.

994
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,000
I am gonna get this one.

995
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:29,800
Is this?

996
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:32,100
This is the Andrew song special here.

997
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,900
Yeah, so I am going to try to make a Korean.

998
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,500
Taco, because I am Korean love it, ingredients.

999
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:49,700
Little bit of a talk.

1000
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:50,300
Okay.

1001
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:53,900
Talk to your right.

1002
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,700
What are these leaves again?

1003
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:06,000
Yeah, so that in particular the bundle that we do send you is just a field medley of herbs.

1004
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:14,400
But that one in your hand was a Malabar spinach leaf lettuce.

1005
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,300
Got more kids coming on my side.

1006
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:23,100
So you will start hearing some kids screaming, but I am going to top this off with some salsa.

1007
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:24,900
Love it.

1008
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,000
Nice.

1009
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:28,100
That sounds like my taco.

1010
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,100
Cheers.

1011
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:34,800
Cheers Alexis, so how's it going with plating?

1012
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:40,100
I mean, you're just diving right in the drink.

1013
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,200
I didn't know the artistic plate was part of it.

1014
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:55,700
I was like very much building, right into a taco in my mouth, kudos to all providers out there.

1015
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:56,800
That wasn't me.

1016
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,100
What's yours do you Alexis?

1017
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:03,800
It looks like Zachary Smith is down.

1018
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,300
Eat on stage with us.

1019
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:06,400
Yeah, take me off.

1020
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,900
I don't want to see me anymore.

1021
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:09,900
You're welcome.

1022
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:10,500
Today.

1023
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:13,600
We're all just hang it right through Andrew.

1024
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,000
Thank you Chef.

1025
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:15,800
That was wonderful.

1026
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,300
Thank you.

1027
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,200
I would love to ask.

1028
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,800
What's everyone's favorite.

1029
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:22,200
Salsa.

1030
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:27,400
You guys lean towards the Verde like myself, or do you like this month pregnancy or bit more?

1031
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,400
The answer is yes, Emily.

1032
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:32,600
You have a fourth Taco.

1033
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:33,700
Maybe even if it.

1034
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,100
All right, I gotta say, my favorite.

1035
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:45,900
I think out of the three meats, I have here, the fork with the soft rubber dogs.

1036
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,700
Yeah, it's clutch.

1037
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:51,300
Shelby boy, gets it.

1038
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:53,400
I really eat.

1039
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:54,800
One of the meat straight up.

1040
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,400
Probably go for the steak.

1041
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:03,300
But when you put the toppings with the Carnitas, that's the best.

1042
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,000
It's a magical feeling.

1043
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,200
It's a Magical pair.

1044
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:10,300
That's what we're here for, right?

1045
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:13,800
I felt all my good brain controls released.

1046
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:22,600
Once I get into that when we got to feed the Sous chefs to, so make sure you feed your for making some shots.

1047
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:42,600
Swallows it, they do the sweeping, you know, they have come through and especially my line in my kitchen is always nice and clean my little Hoover vacuum suit sous-chef over here.

1048
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,300
Keeps it tight.

1049
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:49,100
Yeah, whenever she's not around, they drop something on the floor.

1050
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:51,400
What do I do now?

1051
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,100
I know it's like, so I do I have to pick this up?

1052
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:54,900
This is not fair.

1053
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:58,000
Starting work, Chef.

1054
01:34:58,300 --> 01:34:59,000
Great job.

1055
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:00,200
Great job.

1056
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:13,800
All right, so we're going to move to lounge and Continue the remainder of this time together and lounges are there.

1057
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,200
Any final thoughts?

1058
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:28,100
Chef that you have for us any like tips, best practices, a Twitter, quote, anything, keep those fingertips tucked in?

1059
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:28,700
All right.

1060
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,200
Next time I see you guys.

1061
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:33,000
I better see all everyone with 10 fingers.

1062
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:34,300
Keep on cooking.

1063
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:39,100
It's, you know your own expression, and we're here to eat.

1064
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:40,400
So Enjoy the food, guys.

1065
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,600
It was really such a pleasure cooking with all of you.

1066
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:44,700
I am looking forward to the next one.

1067
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:45,700
So I will see you then.

1068
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:47,800
Thank you, everyone.

1069
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,200
Enjoy your food idea.

1070
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:09,600
We grow primarily Greens on here and I wanted to have more land because gardening was a hobby that got out of control.

1071
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,200
So we practice permaculture principles out here.

1072
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:21,100
The way you can Define permaculture is that get is a way to design an ecosystem that is beneficial to plan.

1073
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,700
Soil and humans.

1074
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:28,100
One of our primary missions is to lead the land in better shape than when we found it.

1075
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,800
A lot of farms, don't practice that we have these tunnels.

1076
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,100
We have hundred-foot tunnels.

1077
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:36,600
We have five of them on our farm right now, and they are great.

1078
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,200
Protectors from extreme weather star Greenhouse.

1079
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:50,100
And then we transplant by hand, all of these letters, heads that we have grown in our Greenhouse from seed.

1080
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,500
So, everything we grow here, we have grown ourselves.

1081
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:57,200
I love, love, love growing lettuce.

1082
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:07,900
What you'd be enjoying at your event or lettuce is from this bed and most likely this bed for the folks who are going to be part of this event.

1083
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,100
I think you're going to really like this lettuce.

1084
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:18,300
One of the things that I really love about Austin is how food-centric it is.

1085
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:22,900
So many great restaurants in Austin by local and local farms.

1086
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,900
There's a really nice healthy diversity of farms.

1087
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:34,800
And that wouldn't exist if restaurants and school districts, grocery stores, weren't supporting those local farms.

1088
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:41,300
The more you keep your money local, the more you're growing the economy and the more you're Growing the future health of your own community.

1089
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:44,500
And that's, it's great to see, Austin.

1090
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,300
Not only talk that talk.

1091
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,400
I really walk that walk.

1092
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,500
She knows what's coming.
