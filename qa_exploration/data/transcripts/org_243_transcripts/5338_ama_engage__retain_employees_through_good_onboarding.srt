4
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:38,700
We are talking today about onboarding and especially with remote teams there is this magic window that either makes or breaks an employee experience as well as their commitment and loyalty to a company.

5
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,700
And so we have got Laura from Sora.

6
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,700
And Craig from my Avant who's gonna help us dissect and dive deep into some of these insights.

11
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,200

15
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,200

We're going to kick it off this morning.

17
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,800
Well for me.

18
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,700
I am in Oahu Hawaii.

19
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,400
I am seeing some of you tuning in.

20
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,700
We got you sip from Turkey, Canada.

21
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,700
All right, we're all over La.

22
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,800
This is great.

23
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,500
So we're going to kick it off this morning with a pole.

24
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,600
What is your biggest onboarding challenge?

25
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,100
Feel free to drop your boats.

26
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:07,100
Is it frustrating manual processes, a lack of Engagement scaling as the company grows onboarding remotely or stakeholder accountability?

27
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,500
Go ahead and drop in your votes.

28
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,800
All right, we're starting to see them come through.

29
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,000
Lack of Engagement, onboarding remotely, stakeholder accountability.

30
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,200
That's coming up a lot.

31
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Then next is.

32
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,400
Okay.

33
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,400
Leveling out onboarding, remotely and stakeholder accountability.

34
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
All right.

35
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,100
Okay.

36
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,300
That's very insightful.

37
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,000
Thank you.

38
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
We're going to pick our panelists.

39
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,600
And so with that, I would love to introduce to our stage.

40
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:45,400
Laura co-founder and CEO of skoura And Craig Executive Director people operations and analytics of my Avant.

41
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,900
Hello, hello.

42
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,800
Hello to see you both.

43
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,400
Where are you tuning in from?

44
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
I am in LA and seasoning.

45
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,600
Great! Tiny red.

46
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,700
How about you Netherlands?

47
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:03,900
Netherlands.

48
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,900
Wow, we are truly across the globe.

49
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,800
I am in Hawaii.

50
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,800
So It's great to have you here on our stage, and I am very excited about this topic.

51
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,000
Some of the poll results that we just saw were identifying some challenges.

52
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,300
Are those some common challenges that you normally see?

53
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,600
What are your thoughts to that?

54
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,800
Yeah, it's not gonna be able to talk this whole time.

55
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,700
Yeah, honestly.

56
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,800
Very, very common.

57
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,600
Everything from manual processes.

58
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,600
We here to engaging stakeholders especially hiring managers.

59
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,100
We hear that a lot, a lot.

60
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
And what was the other one?

61
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,100
That one?

62
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,200
Remind me, I am boarding.

63
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,500
Remotely engagement remotely.

64
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:51,900
Yes.

65
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,800
Yes, of course.

66
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,900
You know that all the time will always will continue to be a question, a very A common question.

67
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,800
But especially obviously with covid has been very topical.

68
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,300
Yeah, I would, I would agree.

69
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:16,800
I sometimes think were in our own world and doing with their own challenges and then when you pull up and you have discussions like this, we're all dealing with the same things and I do think in some ways.

70
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:31,600
Stakeholder accountability has spiked a little bit more in recent years just because we're working a little bit more virtually and I know we will get into this a little bit later but things like the Buddy program that you set up new hires with.

71
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:40,500
Those are things that are been always Balance with trying to Tinker with to make sure that individual is creating the best experience for new hires.

72
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,500
That's good.

73
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,800
Oh, I am excited.

74
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:53,500
I have been to some of this but before we do jump into the questions can you tell us a little bit about each of your organization's and what kind of problems you all are solving?

75
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,400
Yeah, sure, yeah.

76
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,400
So as of three weeks ago, I was with my event Sciences, but I am now a free agent.

77
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:15,400
And in fact, this trip that I am on in Europe, it was one reason I actually left, and I am thinking about extending my trip in Europe for a couple months.

78
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:22,100
But when I was with my event, I was head of people operations and analytics.

79
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,700
So we did a lot of the onboarding The off-boarding.

80
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:39,100
We also had responsibility for the full technology stack as well as benefits and then since we were small we would also get involved in the programs like, you know, return to site or the employee survey or Performance Management.

81
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,300
And I am Laura, co-founder and CEO of Sora.

82
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:59,900
We are an employee onboarding platform that helps you create really powerful employee experiences, but do so at scale automating a lot of the tedious pieces and doing it with a human touch.

83
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:09,200
So seeing a lot, a lot of companies, onboarding processes, and trying to sort of optimize them and have lots of thoughts on the topic.

84
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,300
That's great.

85
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:22,500
All right, so we're going to dive into some of these questions that were submitted in advance, but also questions that we sort of came up with as we were in discussions together as a group prior to this event.

86
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,200
You know, we when we think about that magic window that we're just taught, what I was mentioning, there's actually a stat from sure.

87
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,300
I am that says, like, you know if you do onboarding well then 69% of your employees will actually stay.

88
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:43,600
So from day one, what are some really great Ways that we can engage our new hire.

89
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:59,200
Yeah, so I think that you sent this even ahead of time and one of the emails promoting this event but I think it's a really big question to sort of unpack.

90
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:09,900
So I like to take the word engage new hire and break it down a little bit and I think there's four main goals in engaging a new hire.

91
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,700
One is just getting them excited.

92
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:21,200
Of course like a good first impression is the first thing that happens and it's most important one is introduction.

93
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:35,300
Helping them understand the team and their contributions, and their goals, like introducing them to what work at your company, will be integration where they're actually meeting people.

94
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:44,200
And I always refer to this stat, where referred employees are much more successful on average than non referred employees.

95
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,400
And it's not because, you know, of course, it's not that rich people who are referred happened to be smarter than others.

96
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:57,900
It's because they have someone they can go to ask silly questions to ask where they should be finding information.

97
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:05,200
And so our goal should be to shorten that Gap and eliminate the Gap entirely so that everyone feels integrated enough.

98
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,300
Where they know where to go for questions with a know where to go for information.

99
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,400
So that integration goal I think is very important as well.

100
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,100
And finally fourth way I think of Engagement is ramp like actually getting them.

101
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,800
Up to speed and set up for success for their actual role.

102
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:42,100
And the skills that they need to develop etcetera, oftentimes that's dependent on teams and all kinds of other things, but excitement, introduction and integration are all things that as people team we can be doing to.

103
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,400
We can be influencing in our onboarding processes.

104
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,300
That's great.

105
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,200
So I will go ahead, Craig.

106
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,100
Oh no.

107
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:59,100
I was only going to say we often find new hires have that excitement when they first join.

108
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:10,800
So we really try to focus on what Laura described as the end of introduction integration in a ramp and doing that very well, and we can get into some of those details here in the moment.

109
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:19,300
So just to summarize those four points again it's excitement, introduction integration and ramp.

110
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,700
Those are the Is, I think it's easiest to break down and honestly there are 50 more.

111
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:32,700
There are so many goals we could have during onboarding, but I think they mostly can be broken down into those themes.

112
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:41,200
And then, what I typically do when I am helping someone with an onboarding process is for every single one of those goals.

113
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Think about what you are doing before they start when they start and a few weeks months after they start.

114
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,100
And it just makes it a little easier to break down your process and see.

115
00:15:51,200 --> 00:16:01,700
Where you have gaps and where you can fill in, you know, as managers we traditionally here that onboarding window is around 30 60 90, would you sit days?

116
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,200
Would you agree to that?

117
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Or does it continue before or less than that?

118
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Like, what is that?

119
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,400
Sweet spot of truly engaging an employee.

120
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:24,900
I do think a little bit before is important to acknowledge having a point of contact having someone on our marketing team, actually published a couple days ago.

121
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,200
30 questions that your new hire is probably too scared to ask you.

122
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:44,100
There are a lot of questions that need answering some that we aren't anticipating like a lot of our employees asked what they should wear even though we're a fully distributed company and I never would have thought of that like I am wearing a sweater.

123
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,500
Zoom right now.

124
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
We're on welcome, excuse me.

125
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,400
But yeah, I think there are a lot of things.

126
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:58,800
There's a lot of Engagement that needs to happen before the start date to get ready for that.

127
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,400
Excitement to get ready for that ramp Etc.

128
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,900
What do you think?

129
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,099
I know I think that's actually a really good example.

130
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:21,000
We often find that many of our new hires overdressed, the first couple days and to your point, I think they're really trying to understand the Norms of the organization and often.

131
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:28,000
You don't really pick up on a lot of those Norms until you start sort of working with people seeing how other people work.

132
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:43,100
And so, sometimes we take these things for granted, but I do think there's a lot of value in having that resource, perhaps even the recruiter helping with some of those questions, may even prompt some of those questions in advance, just so that the new hire doesn't feel like they're dumb questions.

133
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,700
That's a really good one.

134
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What should I wear?

135
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:56,800
Great answer to provide a new hire before day one, and they're honestly dozens more like that.

136
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,100
You can't see your calendar.

137
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Yet what does my first week look like?

138
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,600
I have no idea what I am walking into there's a lot.

139
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,000
A lot of things you can be doing to prep but then to the other half of your question how long does onboarding extend afterwards?

140
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:21,700
I do think 90 days is a good best practice but honestly The onboarding team, the HR team should be kind of constantly in touch with employees and onboarding.

141
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:28,700
Buddy doesn't have to stop talking to this person after 90 days, you know, ideally, they have actually formed a connection, and they continue to meet.

142
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:50,600
So when Should you evaluate those four goals of onboarding and how you can integrate that into your process 90 days is probably a good boundary to set their but the thoughtfulness should absolutely continue for pretty much the entire tenure of the employee.

143
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,500
Well, then are our onboarding process has certainly evolved over the years.

144
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,100
One thing we did last year, and I am sure many are familiar on this call or this webinar.

145
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:17,200
We actually ran an organizational network analysis, which essentially is a map of all the connections and who people are connected to it's like really doing an x-ray of your organization.

146
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,200
That's cool.

147
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,000
What we found was as you.

148
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:26,800
Imagine new hires don't have nearly the number of connections as more tenured employees.

149
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
That's very normal.

150
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,700
But we actually lagged the benchmarks.

151
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,800
So prior to that we actually would focus more on working with the manager on.

152
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,600
What are the projects, how do you get them?

153
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:53,200
Ramped up very quickly and what we pivoted to was trying to actually get the new hire focus more on the relationship building and it's hard because I think the new hire Comes in, and they want to prove themselves.

154
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:00,100
We really try to say it's not about that at this stage, you're here, and we have hired you for a reason.

155
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:21,000
So we started to do a lot more meet and greets, some of our new hires will facilitate up to 60 plus meet and greets and that may sound overwhelming, but we often get really good feedback because when you get individuals talking one-on-one with individuals that's when you're really going to pick up on.

156
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,000
Code, what does that person do?

157
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,500
What are some of those Norms?

158
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:37,500
So we try to get the new hire to slow down in the beginning, and really focus on just take a be, you know, focus on some of this new hire paperwork at your benefit sorted out.

159
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,900
Yes, you're probably going to have one or two projects from your manager, you can begin working on those.

160
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,900
But let us really invest them in getting to know people.

161
00:20:47,400 --> 00:21:06,200
And the other thing we got a lot of traction with is even some of the ongoing meetings that happen, weekly, and monthly just involving new hires in those and even though they have no role when they start to observe the other more tenured employees that really I think integrates them very, very quickly.

162
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,000
That's interesting.

163
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,200
I wanted to touch again.

164
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,900
The visual x-ray of the organization.

165
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,300
Can you what is that?

166
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,200
Like how do you even pull a visual x-ray of?

167
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,000
Is it like relationship Network?

168
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,500
What exactly is that x-ray?

169
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:54,400
So the primary set of connections, we mapped is through what we call, stakeholder feedback, which we run on an annual basis and what that process looks like, is each employee can nominate up to five individuals to get feedback from and then their manager can review those add maybe delete connections, and then we also later in the reporting hierarchy and from that you can really build out this entire map of whose connected?

170
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,200
Who's not, who's far away from each other future State?

171
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:09,800
We want to layer in more of the passive data such as like email, such as like chat messages, not in a big brother way.

172
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,400
We have no interest in the content of that.

173
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,500
We're just trying to understand how the organization is working.

174
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,300
Like whom are your influencers, who are your hubs, who are your Brokers?

175
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,300
And it's all with this focus on really getting new hires.

176
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,200
Ingrained very quickly and having a healthy Network so that communication is working.

177
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,600
Very seamlessly.

178
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,500
It's fascinating.

179
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:40,200
If I wanted to do an x-ray of my org like what tool or how do you go back to do that?

180
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:52,300
Oh gosh, I couldn't speak more highly of a tool called poly node, which they're based in Australia, the CEO is so Hands-On.

181
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,400
Amazing.

182
00:22:53,500 --> 00:23:01,700
And we also use lattice for our Performance Management, and they recently built out an API that seamlessly connects with that.

183
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,500
So it's all just plug and play very quickly and it's very cost.

184
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,700
Efficient to, these are not heavy resource type projects.

185
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,600
Get to know.

186
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,300
Awesome.

187
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,600
All right, so another question that we have is scaling onboarding depending on company size.

188
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,300
So obviously, when you're a smaller company, there's a lot of personal touch that you can offer at that point.

189
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:43,800
But as a company grows from 50 to 100 to 200 to 500, I am sure the thresholds, you know, you have Completely different sets of challenges at scale.

190
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,400
So could you both speak to a little bit about that?

191
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,500
You know what?

192
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:54,100
What are those thresholds and what are some of the things that need to adjust?

193
00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:01,700
So that you could still maintain that human touch, the personalization throughout the employee experience?

194
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,500
Yeah, it's a really good question.

195
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,800
So I joined my event.

196
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,000
When we had 200 employees, and now we are just over 600.

197
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:23,400
I think, when I had first joined, the operations team was immensely responsive in a very personal way to new hires and there's such a beauty in that.

198
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,700
But in a lot of ways, I don't think it was creating a consistent experience.

199
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,800
And in other ways, I don't think the team that I had was focusing on.

200
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,100
Right type of work.

201
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,700
It was more manual work.

202
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:46,200
So this is when we actually brought in Surah to help us automate a lot of those tasks and it's a fine line in a lot of ways you don't want to automate it.

203
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:53,900
So that it feels like a machine and you lose the personal touch but in a lot of ways and I think sore is done an amazing job of this.

204
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:02,500
It's actually helped us make the onboarding process very consistent and it's allowed us not to have anything fall through the cracks.

205
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:14,300
We had this issue, where we would have all staff meetings, you on a quarterly basis and the new hires, were not included in that, and we would find out after the fact and that's the hugeness on our part.

206
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:28,500
So that allowed our team to focus more on the curation of the benefits or the day one, orientation or really taking more of the bespoke approach, but just in a different way.

207
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,200
So it's focusing on the right work and not so much the manual work.

208
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,000
Totally.

209
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:48,700
Yeah, I think a lot of what we see as companies meet hit these sort of inflection points of whatever they were doing, is clearly no longer working, sometimes it's compliance-related.

210
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,300
Like, when you're 10 people, you're not really thinking about this large-scale compliance.

211
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,800
When you're a thousand people, you better not drop a single person's.

212
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:03,400
I mean, I usually handle drop it a single person's I9 but there's a lot more consequences as you.

213
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,000
Larger.

214
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,800
There are a lot I guess.

215
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,100
Yeah.

216
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,900
To sum it up Craig, put it.

217
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:18,500
Well, it's just easy to let more and more things fall through the cracks, as you have more people going through because it's just too much to remember.

218
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:28,300
But also, as you have more things that need to happen in onboarding, you need to schedule a bunch of meat and grades, you need to skip, add them to calendar invites.

219
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,800
You need to add them to all the relevant tools.

220
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,100
You there's just like more that needs to happen.

221
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:42,100
The more complex, your organization becomes and usually that's living in some kind of spreadsheet or in a combination of a few people's heads.

222
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,900
And there's just human error likely to be introduced.

223
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,700
Also, to Craig's point, The.

224
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:03,600
Work required to do the sort of bare minimum of just meeting compliance, adding them to the right meetings and getting them set up.

225
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Means that a lot of the more human pieces are dropped by default because there's just not enough time in the day to have your ideal onboarding process.

226
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,500
So you might have 15 ideas for things, you want to do.

227
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:24,000
But you're never going to get to them because the list of tasks that you must do is only growing.

228
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,200
And the number of people you must do them for is only growing.

229
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,000
I mean that's brings up a question for me about.

230
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:53,100
Just how do you balance the robotic what could feel like robotic tasks with the human touch Craig you talk a lot about earlier how really getting people into relationship and the one-on-ones is so critical the 60 plus meet and greets, right?

231
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,800
I mean how do you balance that?

232
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
How do you hold?

233
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Hold your manager.

234
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:26,400
And also even your team members accountable to making sure that balance is maintained Well, so what's interesting is, we're now getting to this place where the Departments are starting to build their own onboarding process, and we have found, you know, recently that their onboarding process I think was very separate from what we were doing and very misaligned.

235
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:34,200
And so often new hires were being thrown a lot of information in the beginning that they just can't retain.

236
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:42,000
So, Really it's allowed us to just take a step back and actually focus more on the curation and really think through.

237
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,600
OK, what do they need to know on day?

238
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:55,400
One day, two weeks, one month one, and then we are starting to also reach out to those departments with larger groups that are having their own onboarding and really figure out.

239
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,700
Where is this handshake?

240
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,800
That's supposed to happen.

241
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:04,400
So it doesn't feel like we're doing something that's in conflict with what they're doing to do that type of work though.

242
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:20,000
The only way you could, Focus on it is if you automate all these other things that as Laura put, it just consumes your day unless you forgot smarter ways to handle it and you can make even the automated stuff you can make it.

243
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:31,300
There is an upfront cost of like planning, all of that out, making it thoughtful and just kind of mat, you know, it's a simple as like, imagine you're going through onboarding.

244
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,000
What communication would you want to know?

245
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,200
What questions would you want answered to our points earlier?

246
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,600
How should I craft this email?

247
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:46,600
How would I craft this email, if they were employee number 15 with a few logistical changes?

248
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:52,800
That's how you should be speaking to employ number 500 and in sore, at least.

249
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,300
But there are other tools that do this as well, you can send an email that's actually coming from a human email address.

250
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:05,200
And when the new hire replies, you that person gets it in their inbox as if they really had sent.

251
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,100
That email.

252
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,400
So it is actually the human email it's just happening for you.

253
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:26,100
So an automated human email as much as that sounds like an oxymoron and when you are Bringing other stakeholders and I think that was the other part of the question.

254
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,300
How can you actually engage managers?

255
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:41,100
Make it very easy for them and make it fun for them and show them the impact of what a great looks like.

256
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,100
So, sometimes we have seen customer show, like, this is what good onboarding means for your report.

257
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,000
This is what bad onboarding means for your report, and it's really motivating for managers.

258
00:30:52,400 --> 00:31:14,400
If you just like, give them a list of 20 things to do, they're never going to look at this email, but if you're leasing it out a little bit and it's like this is the first thing to do the second thing to do, we actually did for you, we're going to send this email from you, you don't need to do anything about it, but if you get a reply FYI, you know, these are some things you can say.

259
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:26,200
So just like make it easy and fun and a little more digestible and again, requires that sort of upfront, planning and thoughtfulness, but pays a lot of dividends in the end.

260
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,900
That makes sense.

261
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:36,800
You know, I see a question here from Elise in our Q&A Tab and it's kind of goes along with what we were just talking about.

262
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,500
What do your 30-60-90 day touchpoints?

263
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:56,900
Look like, We have a, yeah, we have a template that we candidly, we need to improve upon this as I am sure many, many companies do.

264
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,800
But right now, what we do is we have a template for managers.

265
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:13,000
We have Surah tasks that have them schedule at 30, 60, and 90 days meetings that are outside of their typical one-on-ones, and we have our HR team reach out.

266
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,100
We Survey at 30 60 and 90 days.

267
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,300
What do they look like?

268
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,600
They're ideally as goal focused as possible.

269
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,300
This is what we said.

270
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,900
We wanted to have both on my end as a manager and on your end as an employee.

271
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,700
How did we do?

272
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,200
Was there anything that you learned in the past 30 day?

273
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,100
Let us say you're at 60 days.

274
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,600
Was there anything that you learned in the past 30 days?

275
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,600
That would have been really helpful to know in your first week?

276
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:51,300
That will help inform future onboarding iterations, just a few thoughtful look back and look forward questions.

277
00:32:51,300 --> 00:33:07,500
They don't have to be, you know, 90-minute conversations by any means, but they should be genuine and thoughtful and actually trying to pull out information that you will use in future iterations, or with that employee to improve their experience.

278
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,000
Rather than, like, did you have a good time?

279
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,700
Like, that's not really actionable.

280
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,000
On anyone's end.

281
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:30,000
Yeah, and we think about the first 30 days is sort of the hygienic period of how do we make sure that they're enrolled in benefits and the I9 they have gone through sexual harassment training.

282
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:40,100
We're also in a highly regulatory type environment, so there's many compliance things and Sops that they have to read.

283
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,500
I wish we could do a better job of tearing those out.

284
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,600
But for various reasons, it's hard.

285
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,700
But we So, and Laura spoke about this.

286
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:56,300
We also try to introduce some of the fun things so you get to order your swag in the first week.

287
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:09,400
We also when we were all working from home during covid, we would have them record a welcome video, which we would show at an all staff meeting so that's yeah that's more or less the first 30 days.

288
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:16,199
The first 60 days, we start to get them into more of the Performance Management type stuff.

289
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:23,300
We Use a tool as I mentioned called lattice and it's been a game changer for us in that.

290
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:33,500
The user experience is very strong, but it also has this functionality called one-on-ones which really allows a manager and employee to throughout the week.

291
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,500
Put on, you know, this one on one tool.

292
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:46,500
What they want to talk about when they actually discuss and it allows the manager to have a little bit of a preview of what's on the new hires mind and vice versa.

293
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:54,100
And if they don't get to a top, Like it just carries over to the next week so it really allows them to get in sync and very, very quickly.

294
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,700
We also introduced them to a recognition program and making sure that they know they can recognize employees.

295
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,100
And then when we get to the 90-day Mark, that's more of the check-in for us.

296
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,400
How are you doing?

297
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,800
How are things going?

298
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,600
We haven't got to this stage, or we have some work to do on that.

299
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,100
We're not as proactive as I wish, we were just because we're all busy, but that's where we're headed in the future.

300
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:21,900
I love that.

301
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:33,200
So just to recap that you said the first 30 days is like the check the boxes hygiene and then the next that 60-day Mark, you're thinking about Performance Management.

302
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,100
And then at the 90-day Mark, it's more of a check-in.

303
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,400
Exactly right.

304
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:52,400
That's great, love that and I love the idea on the welcome video that a new hire can do or just order swag within the first few weeks of their onboarding.

305
00:35:52,500 --> 00:36:08,600
Are there any other ideas like that you all are seeing for yourselves or your customers where they are figuring out these little things that just boost engagement, you know, by 50 points when you do these things?

306
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,100
Yeah.

307
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:19,100
Waited to the excitement goal that we talked about the excitement part of Engagement sending swag as early as possible.

308
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:24,300
Sending plants, if you're distributed sending, like some kind of thing that will help them set up.

309
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:29,400
Their workspace, send emails from leaders.

310
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,400
Make sure you have people.

311
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,700
They have already met reach out to them and congratulate them on their offer.

312
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,100
A few best practices there, one.

313
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,400
Really big thing that a previous company I worked at did that?

314
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:51,800
I feel like most companies Miss. is that there are so many logistical things that need to happen to Craig's point.

315
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,100
And his industry, there are even more logistical things than average.

316
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:02,100
The very first session on the very first day doesn't have to be sexual harassment training though.

317
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,400
It can be a really exciting demo of your product.

318
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,500
It can be the cultural session with the CEO.

319
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:20,000
The very first thing should be like, Exciting and calming the new hire a little bit like, okay, I made the right decision really in some ways.

320
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,800
I think of the first two to four weeks of onboarding as your entire job is like give the new hire confirmation that they made the right decision.

321
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,100
Keep them at that Peak excitement, as long as possible before it just like naturally Wayne's a little bit.

322
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:51,000
So as much as you can squeeze into Craig's Point, some of the fun things, ideally first thing on the first day, but also another Fun lunch on the first day, some other meet and greets in their first week, whatever.

323
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,700
You can think of That's Unique to your culture.

324
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,400
And Company is really important to Splash in right at the beginning.

325
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,600
Such a good point.

326
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:38,700
We also, we had this thing called the social six and so every month we would randomly put six employees together and Nate someone to facilitate out of the six and it was just a 30-minute get together you know meet some new people No Agenda so things like that II know it well and you know for some I think it's like I need to start contributing but I think there's so much value and really understanding who your other colleagues are is a broader human being.

327
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,400
We also have you know many companies have slack.

328
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:53,600
We have Microsoft These, and we have things to it, like cooking channels pet channels and it's just a way I think to understand, you know, again, someone outside of the work.

329
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,800
One thing.

330
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:06,900
We're still trying to figure out when we were smaller, our CEO would actually have a monthly luncheon with all the new hires and it was asked me anything, you know, there's nothing off limits.

331
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,900
We can't do that now given our size.

332
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,300
So we're trying to push some of that to the functional executive team.

333
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,900
Ember as opposed to it always needs to be the CEO.

334
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:33,300
That is tricky that scaling the meet and greet with the executives and with the CEO you know like you mentioned it's easier to do when you're 50 or maybe even 100 but how you know how do you bring in the CEO?

335
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:42,800
Touchpoint aside from your all-hands meetings and other corporate Gatherings are there other ways to bring your executive leadership in more clothes.

336
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,900
The six group or how do you do that scale?

337
00:39:52,800 --> 00:40:06,400
I think the format needs to change but the CEO should ideally still talk to new hires so it can't necessarily be ama if it's 50, people 21c CEO.

338
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,000
That's a lot of new hires to be enough.

339
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Everyone is going to get their questions answered but there could be a format kind of similar to this, where you get some questions ahead of time.

340
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,400
Maybe the CEO goes through those but also just goes through as sort of normal Spiel of culture, and whatever else.

341
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,700
Want to engage with new hires on.

342
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:41,500
So it's I think it's a format thing but it shouldn't be cut which is a mistake that we see a lot of companies do is like once something becomes unscalable, they cut it rather than just changing it.

343
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,000
Such that it's scalable from now.

344
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:54,900
And that's when you advised not to cut the CEO, touch point is really critical, I think so and to Craig's point it can also Oh, be a functional executive.

345
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,700
The CEO has a different format but the you're on the marketing team and your marketing executive does, your am a.

346
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,000
So you still are getting some of these pieces is just slightly different.

347
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And at my events size, the marketing and AMA is actually probably more relevant to this marketing new higher than a super generalized.

348
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,300
Am a so can still add a lot of value makes sense.

349
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:25,300
So I will go ahead, Craig, Oh no, the was just going to piggyback on what Laura said.

350
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:39,000
We're also trying to get away from sometimes these events you know where you're invited to meet the CEO, which in some ways I think puts pressure on some that they need to show up a certain way.

351
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:47,300
And so, one thing our CEOs really good about is he just wants to join everyday meetings and understand what's going on.

352
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:54,500
And I what I really like about that, is it, just breaks down the layers, the highwomen, Our keys and really speaks to.

353
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,900
We're all working to the same goals, and we're all, you know, side-by-side working on these things.

354
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:06,700
And that's where I really think you develop the relationships as opposed to this like Q&A format all the time.

355
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,100
There's a place for that but also just integrated into the everyday work.

356
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
I might need to copy your CEO.

357
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:35,000
Also, related to something you said earlier and made me think about when you said, removing some of that pressure, the six, the social six things that you go nominating, a facilitator I wanted to underline because otherwise when it's just six people in a zoom it's so hard to know.

358
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,600
I often find myself like wanting to carry the conversation forward, not really having prompts.

359
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,600
We actually have a blog post about that to like questions.

360
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:52,000
You can prompt in a welcome lunch because sometimes there's just this like painful Zoom silence that's really hard to get through.

361
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,300
And yeah I think the facilitation idea is super smart.

362
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,600
I agree with that.

363
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,900
S Plus 1.

364
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:11,900
So we were touching it a little bit earlier about some of the challenges and you know, I would love to hear what are some I like the do.

365
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:20,200
Not dues in onboarding like clearly don't miss the CEO meet-and-greet, don't miss these things.

366
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:29,200
What are some of the things you're seeing maybe across companies that you work with, even what you learned for yourselves, where you're like, okay, we really learned a good lesson.

367
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,500
We got to make sure that we don't do this.

368
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:40,700
The first one that comes to mind is schedule every minute of people's days for the first day or first week.

369
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,900
It's so common and it's not helpful, it's extremely overwhelming, their super tired.

370
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,400
And they have, I think, people think like, they will have nothing to do but there's plenty to do.

371
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,500
They are trying to absorb as much as possible.

372
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,100
There are things to read if you don't feel comfortable.

373
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,200
We actually give we send people an email on their second day.

374
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:10,800
Like, You know, you have plenty to do, do not feel pressure to do these things, but if you find yourself, wanting extra things to read, here's an HR blog post.

375
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,800
Here's a newsletter.

376
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:25,400
You can follow here are some like interesting pieces in our with interesting reads in our Wiki related, to culture related to your team Etc that you can look at.

377
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,300
But yeah, scheduling every minute of every day is a big No-No in my book.

378
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:33,600
Thank you.

379
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,000
That was going to be mine.

380
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,200
I am trying to think of a couple others.

381
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,200
Well, I had mentioned the new hire, buddy program.

382
00:44:42,200 --> 00:45:00,900
This is something that's good on our radar for some time and I think for me to answer your question, sometimes I think if that individual is not committed it just creates a lot of damage and leaves a really bad taste in their mouth.

383
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,400
And so we're really Trying to figure out how to craft that program in a better way.

384
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:17,800
So for example we had this rule where you can only be a new hire buddy if you had been with the organization more than a year, I actually think a new hire buddy that's recently gone through.

385
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:23,800
The onboarding is actually in a better position for some of the things that the new hires may be asking about.

386
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:40,100
So kind of pressure testing some of these like maybe historic ideas we have the other thing too is often I think we always hate when we find out later that someone was struggling, and we just didn't know.

387
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,700
And so how to make new hires really comfortable.

388
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:53,800
In maybe, raising a little bit of a flag at a certain point that hey, something doesn't feel quite right when we can catch it earlier.

389
00:45:53,900 --> 00:46:00,600
I know nine times out of 10, we could fix it, it's just when it percolates a little bit.

390
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,400
That's when we run into some problems.

391
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:08,500
So how do you encourage and get the feedback from a new hire?

392
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,700
So you can get it a little bit more real time.

393
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:19,400
So one of the things, so I come from the survey world, so I am like Pro surveys and so many ways.

394
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,600
But often I think it's just a matter of picking up the phone and saying like, hey how's it going often?

395
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:35,400
I think you just piggy or you, you jump so many of the process type things and you just cut right to the bone of what you need to get to.

396
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:42,300
It's just a matter of like making sure you do those things, and we'd certainly been guilty that some of those things.

397
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:50,800
Oh by the wayside with everything else we're doing, so we're still trying to figure out smarter ways where we can have some of those organic touch points.

398
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,200
That's not done, quote unquote through like a system.

399
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:04,700
I think this is maybe the theme of this chat is that it requires a combination of the automated and the human and it's too easy to forget.

400
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,700
One of those pieces with communication people.

401
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,600
Often forget that, you can automate that, with surveys people.

402
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,300
Often forget that.

403
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:21,600
You should also ask in inhuman ways and having the qualitative and quantitative data is the only way to get an actual picture.

404
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:23,800
That's good.

405
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,900
Well, that leads to my next question here.

406
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:33,100
When it comes to technology and platforms, what are some recommendations?

407
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:54,400
We spoke about a few earlier, but what could make the onboarding more efficient and personalized overall So I am a huge fan of Sora, like, I could not recommend sore enough and I perhaps a little biased, but it's just, it's really bent.

408
00:47:54,900 --> 00:48:01,300
It's been a complete Game Changer and I can't imagine going back to a world where we don't have Surah.

409
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:08,900
I mentioned Paulino for Ona org network analysis, lattice is also an incredible tool for us.

410
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,700
One tool that we Were made aware of that, we're learning a little bit more about is called amplifier.

411
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:29,600
And essentially, what their solution is, it's sort of like Zoom, but at certain stages in the webinar, you can actually choose who you want to have a breakout with and behind the scenes when everyone's doing that.

412
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:35,400
It then when you do the breakout sessions, it will match people up according to their designations.

413
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:42,400
So that's also a really great way as Laura talked about marrying the technology with the Human Side of Things.

414
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:51,300
And then, I think the other piece that we're exploring is welcome and how to do those, synchronous pieces, better.

415
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:59,600
And Gina, you will probably have a much better sort of overview of that, then we, yeah, thanks for bringing it up.

416
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,700
I mean, with welcome.

417
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:07,500
What's cool is where intentionally focused on the employee experience and overall life cycle.

418
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:13,500
So part of our mission is to be able to empower belonging through our platform.

419
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,800
And create those human touch points.

420
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,900
So, if we have got platforms, like, Sora and some of the other ones that are handling, the automated tasks.

421
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,900
We're trying to create what you could call almost like your hybrid virtual Auditorium.

422
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:39,500
That enables your team members, whether it's a group of six, they're jumping in to do a little quick photo booth snapshot together with a facilitator that's leading that or it's an all hands Gathering.

423
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,300
We're thinking about all of those touch points and Gatherings across the life cycle.

424
00:49:43,300 --> 00:50:02,100
So I do see how each of these Technologies even with the lattice and others, they all complement one another, but to the point of I think in the theme that we're all talking about, we still need that intentionality from leadership and from the planning and management side to make sure all these tools orchestrate.

425
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,500
Well together.

426
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:12,700
And I think this last question in the Q&A is like the perfect combination of how all this is impacting employees as well.

427
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,900
I just jump into it.

428
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:15,700
Should I use?

429
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:20,600
So the question is, how does the onboarding experience affect the rest of the employee Journey?

430
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:31,900
There are so many studies on the importance of onboarding and employee retention Employee Engagement, basically off of the most important metrics and metrics that not just people team care about.

431
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:39,000
But CEOs CFOs care about if you're not retaining employees, then you are not going to be a company.

432
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,200
At some point, if you're not ramping employees, then you're not going to hit your sales goals.

433
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,900
You're not To hit your hiring goals.

434
00:50:44,900 --> 00:51:02,900
So, all of these things really are kind of foundational to the entire business and I think two more directly answer the question affect the rest of the employee Journey, some of the themes.

435
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:13,300
So we talked about, you know, excitement introduction, integration ramp, if you break down a lot of the Tactical things you want to do for each of those goals.

436
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:20,600
Connect employees to their goals, to their colleagues, to the mission and vision, vision and culture of your company.

437
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,200
Prepare them from a logistical perspective.

438
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:40,900
From a skills perspective from just expectations in general connection and preparedness all lead to retention productivity and engagement.

439
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:46,000
Which again are basically like the most important things, I think people team care about at this point.

440
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,200
So, might sound like a cop-out answer.

441
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:56,100
But I think the answer to the question is like onboarding effects literally everything and setting them up.

442
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,600
Success is one of the most important things you can do.

443
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:10,800
One of the things we're also trying to push the frontier a little bit on is, so we have been talking about, you know, how we automate our own processes.

444
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:17,700
But we're also working on sort of this starter pack for new hires on how they can automate their own life.

445
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:23,500
So that they could spend the quality time on whether it's work or their family.

446
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,200
That's good.

447
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:32,800
So we're trying to compile a list of things like, you know, when they sign up for benefits, are you Are of these at home delivery services.

448
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,100
That may save you a trip to the pharmacy.

449
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:44,500
I know some companies, actually have, you know, things like booster fuels, that you know, Circle the parking lots, and we will fill up your gas tank.

450
00:52:45,900 --> 00:53:10,300
Some of our employees, also, our little bit, like they just don't know, they can order a second screen and making sure that they know that and the efficiency with some of having those tools and resources, we're starting to see that, you know, in the best case, we're saving some new hires five hours per week and that really adds up when, you know, start to project that out through the year.

451
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:21,800
So as part of the new hire packet, like how can they get smarter about what they're doing, not to focus more on work but just to save them time and do the things that they want to do and more of the quality way.

452
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:36,100
I love that, I think with remote distribu teams boundaries between work and life is really Challenging and as we all know, and burnout is probably at its all-time high.

453
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:42,400
So, to even as an employer to care about that, take the powers that be.

454
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,600
Yeah.

455
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:52,500
And to be able to have processes advice, you know, even strategy offered and how you can manage your personal work life balance.

456
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,900
I think there's something really powerful.

457
00:53:55,100 --> 00:54:00,200
That's communicated to a new hire that of how much this company really cares.

458
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,100
So yeah.

459
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:07,000
So that's a powerful to be able to I think bring that into the first few weeks as well.

460
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,000
That's great.

461
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:09,600
All right.

462
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,700
Well we have got about five minutes or so until we wrap up.

463
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:19,800
Does, if anyone has any questions, feel free to drop them in the Q&A tab chat.

464
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,800
Otherwise, are there any final points of advice?

465
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:33,700
Laura Craig, that you would offer out to each of us here managing leading distributed teams?

466
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:41,800
We have shared some amazing insights and very tactical applicable things we can run and do today.

467
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,100
But is there anything else that you would advise to us?

468
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:58,800
The thing that comes to mind for me, the thing, I am actually working on this at Surah internally is expectation setting.

469
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:10,500
Both again, toward that sort of preparedness theme expectation setting on, like, here's what to expect in your first week, excuse me.

470
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:48,500
But also here is what it means to succeed in your first 30 days, here is what we expect of you, when you're fully ramped, I think The more clear you can be, the more motivated people are ambiguity is very scary and there's a lot of it when you're a new hire, the more you can take that away, the more anxiety goes away and the more your you are genuinely setting them up to hit the goals that you want them to hit.

471
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,500
Because you're telling them very clearly what they are.

472
00:55:52,200 --> 00:56:01,600
So I think I was going to say if you take one thing away, but if you would take two things away from this session, it's like create the human moments.

473
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,300
And if you need to automate things to do that, then do that.

474
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,700
And the second thing would be set, the expectations and be really, really clear.

475
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:10,700
That's great.

476
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,300
Thank you.

477
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:16,800
Gosh, I always icicle first floor because you just started.

478
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,800
So what's really interesting?

479
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:31,600
I think about, you know, we're most of these individuals on the collar and the HR space and in a lot of ways, I think with the world changing, so drastically over the last two years.

480
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:54,700
I sometimes think the field has not been keeping up with really putting employees at the center and I know a lot of Police say that we have certainly been guilty that when you try to design these processes with the employee at the center, it quickly gets to be about the process as opposed to the employee.

481
00:56:55,100 --> 00:57:02,300
So always coming back to that and in a lot of ways, I think we need to kind of be a little bit more experimental.

482
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,700
We need to push the frontier a little bit more.

483
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:11,800
I don't know how many folks on the call are familiar with dowels or decentralized, autonomous organizations.

484
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:18,000
Essentially they're leaderless organizations and there's a lot of really neat stuff.

485
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:33,200
I think some of those groups are pushing but I would go back to what Laura said, around expectation, setting and just intentionality, sometimes even like, on the retention side, I think it's unrealistic.

486
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:42,400
Just to say, we want to retain employees forever and instead, maybe we want this employee to come here and have a great experience for one and two years based on there.

487
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:48,400
All's and really give them a great experience, and not always get stuck in this.

488
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,200
Like, they just need to be here forever.

489
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:56,000
Wow, powerful insights and advice.

490
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,700
I am like simmering in all the goods right now.

491
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,100
Thank you so much.

492
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,800
Laura Craig, this was very insightful helpful.

493
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:11,800
I hope that everyone in the audience today was able to take something away that you can apply to your own companies.

494
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,200
Your own circumstance.

495
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,600
Laura Craig.

496
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:16,800
Thank you.

497
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:23,900
We have a post email that will also include I believe links to A and the recording.

498
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,600
So if any of you wanted to rewind back to the insights, feel free to jump back.

499
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:33,200
Alright, so with that, we're going to wrap up our time here.
