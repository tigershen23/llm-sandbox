00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:15,708

25
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:19,808
So why don't we go ahead and set the stage and set the table for the conversation?

26
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,508
So why are we here today?

27
00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:31,908
You know, when you register for this event you probably register because Ariana and Joe are phenomenal leaders that you want to learn from.

28
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:33,908
And so we're going to get to that in a second.

29
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:39,008
But also you know, we're going to be discussing things that is really relevant to everyone.

30
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:42,708
That's on this event today and that's changing how we work.

31
00:19:43,008 --> 00:19:51,208
And when you look at the landscape of where we are today, it's a very, very relevant content relevant.

32
00:19:51,608 --> 00:20:01,508
Relevant content is being shared, across social media, news articles, every week, every two weeks you see different headlines being announced about the challenges of Shifting to remote.

33
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:04,808
The impact that has on employees, the impact that has on tension.

34
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:13,708
And so we want to bring leaders together to have this conversation of what's fueling, the change of work and how do we do it in a positive way?

35
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:16,908
What are the opportunities that also invites for us?

36
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:29,208
So we're going to be discussing the fundamental changes that we're seeing the Technology that are being shipped and develop to address the support this change and more importantly how to make sure we adapt well.

37
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:35,408
So we take care of our mental health, and we're not sacrificing it at the expense of the work that we're doing.

38
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:37,108
So talking about mental health.

39
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:42,508
Why don't we go ahead and pull up a pole on stage to just do a quick post check here?

40
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:59,508
We have a lot of people here, joining us, and we're going to talk about mental health and this is something that I have been working on, and I am just curious on how Often are you individually taken time on a mental health, practice to really fuel your well-being.

41
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,508
Is that daily?

42
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:01,808
Is it happening once a week?

43
00:21:01,908 --> 00:21:03,308
Is it happening once a month?

44
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:06,108
Or is that honestly not happening often enough?

45
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:17,908
Because we don't want, we don't prioritize these things we're left out on the other side of it, fully burnt out and then it becomes a bigger problem, not just for our employers for ourselves but also for our family.

46
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:21,308
So it looks like we're we have a pretty good mix of folks here.

47
00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:27,508
Here we have people that are doing something daily and I will be curious to learn what that is as we're in conversation.

48
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:31,208
If you want to share some tips and techniques, please drop that in chat.

49
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:37,608
Now, let us go ahead and dive into the core of our time together.

50
00:21:38,108 --> 00:21:42,608
And quickly, I want to touch base on the speakers that we have, and I just get myself out the way again.

51
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:44,708
My name is Roberto, you can call me Rob.

52
00:21:44,908 --> 00:21:54,208
And I am based in Puerto Rico, the co-founder and CEO of welcome and welcome is on a mission to gather Inspire and engage employees that are distributed.

53
00:21:54,208 --> 00:22:01,808
We believe that the times when you bring your employees together, you have to make them count and you have to drive engagement and our technology is built just for that.

54
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:05,608
Now, we have two very special guests and these are friends.

55
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:22,008
And I have been building relationships with both Ariana and Joe over the last year or so phenomenal leaders on the Forefront of the topics that were discussing today started with Arianna, Huffington founder and CEO of Thrive, Huffington Post and off the roof.

56
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:22,708
If teen books.

57
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:26,508
In fact, you know what, I meant, Ariana few months ago, she carried a book with her.

58
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:31,208
We're talking about the importance of sleep, and she took a book out of her bag and gave it to me.

59
00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:39,808
And I so have It's all my nice day and when I am trying to go to sleep, I am bussing that book open and reading a couple lines but it's 2016.

60
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:51,008
She also launched drive a leading Behavior change, technology company with the mission of changing how we work and how we live to put an end to the burnout epidemic.

61
00:22:51,008 --> 00:23:00,308
So, we got the right person here to discuss, mental health and Burdock and then Joe, Joe Thomas is the founder and co-founder CEO of loom.

62
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:05,108
We just talk to Joe inside the Vroom of how much my team uses loom.

63
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:07,408
In fact, there's a leaderboard at my team of common.

64
00:23:07,408 --> 00:23:11,308
Who's the leader at welcome using loom phenomenal product.

65
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:23,608
And so, he's on a mission to empower everyone to at work to communicate effectively regardless of where they're located, and we go to dive into that the importance of a sink and what that means in the future of work.

66
00:23:23,908 --> 00:23:27,508
But not only is he leading a phenomenal company with phenomenal growth.

67
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:32,008
He also became recently a father to a beautiful baby girl.

68
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,608
I can attach to the title of founder and CEO comes way down the line, so the title of father.

69
00:23:38,608 --> 00:23:39,508
So congratulations.

70
00:23:39,508 --> 00:23:40,608
Joe, love to see it.

71
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,308
We're going to talk about that here in a second.

72
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:44,008
Why don't you guys put your hands together?

73
00:23:44,108 --> 00:23:49,908
And so inside of chat for Arianna Huffington and Joe Thomas.

74
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,808

00:23:56,808 --> 00:23:58,908

Yes, it is rolls off the tongue, as I said, require some practice.

00:24:12,608 --> 00:24:14,108
You guys, you guys get it, get it.

81
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:14,608
Get it done.

82
00:24:14,608 --> 00:24:16,608
Well, good to see you both Jill.

83
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:18,308
You're joining us from Atlanta, right?

84
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:22,508
We're just talking, and Ariana, where's were you located today?

85
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:24,708
New York, okay?

86
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:31,908
My apartment in New York which is literally two minutes from our office.

87
00:24:32,908 --> 00:24:34,608
Fantastic.

88
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:36,508
Well, first of all, thank you both for take your time.

89
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:40,508
I know that time is the most valuable thing that we all have.

90
00:24:40,608 --> 00:24:44,208
And you guys are taking time to join this topic, this topic and conversation.

91
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,908
So, so thank you for that.

92
00:24:46,008 --> 00:24:46,808
And I want to jump.

93
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:52,708
Yeah, you say quickly that all of us are thriving, passionate users.

94
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:54,808
Sirs of welcome and of loom.

95
00:24:55,108 --> 00:24:57,608
So I am delighted to be with both of you.

96
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:01,008
You all are what I would say.

97
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:08,308
The bleeding edge, Ariana Ewing Thrive have built an Innovative Company products, and we love to hear it.

98
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:09,408
So, thank you for sharing that.

99
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:17,508
Yeah, and I think there's a I think it's something as it were pausing on and just talking about, you know, the importance of the work that you guys are doing.

100
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:23,808
I think that there is something to be said about building a company built for the future and where we're going right now.

101
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:27,508
And this is why I want to jump it to both sides of that conversation.

102
00:25:27,508 --> 00:25:41,408
One is mental health and the importance of that and the reality of where we are today, but also the technology that we're building to equip a distributed Workforce, we can work more efficiently and this, You world, right?

103
00:25:41,408 --> 00:25:46,408
And so, I want to jump right in, and I am going to kick off with Just Around burnout.

104
00:25:46,408 --> 00:25:59,308
And I know that there's a quick poll and looks like we have an audience that's being very attentive to that and doing some daily practices and some folks are not doing enough and not taking care of their well-being with the rituals.

105
00:25:59,608 --> 00:26:09,308
So, Ariana, you know, all of us feel the importance of burnout, we feel the weight of it as well, but it's not just us, the market is reacting to it.

106
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:16,008
The headlines are acted to it, you know, both on the employee side, but also leaders, you know, you shared an article.

107
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:30,108
I think it was last week that quote, 68 percent of employees and their leaders 81% of the c-suite says that improving their well-being is more important than advancing their careers, you know.

108
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:39,108
And, and to take that even further a few weeks before that you and your team got ahead of that as well and kicked off a mental health.

109
00:26:39,108 --> 00:26:40,108
Pledge I got picked up.

110
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:52,108
The New York Times hundreds of companies have supported it and it's good to see this on both sides right initiatives to address it and the reality of what it actually is.

111
00:26:52,108 --> 00:27:03,008
So I want to take some time and just set the stage on, you know, I have we have heard of burn out, you know, through the years but I have never felt a more tangible than it is today.

112
00:27:03,308 --> 00:27:04,108
How do we get here?

113
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:10,108
How do we get here to this point where it's like top of mind for everybody, what are the drought driving Factor?

114
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,508
Hers that you guys are seeing that's leading to this big problem.

115
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:19,908
Well Roberta, first of all burnout has been with us for years.

116
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:44,108
I was personally diagnosed with burnout in 2007, two years into building that cause when I Collapse and built and broke my cheekbone and the diagnosis was burnout at that time, as you implied, most people were not aware of Burnout, but it's been existing for decades.

117
00:27:44,508 --> 00:27:55,208
The silver lining of the pandemic is that now it fronts and center and it's not just front and center for the HR department.

118
00:27:55,208 --> 00:28:10,108
But for the c-suite for boards, we have finally recognized that employee well-being and mental health are fundamentally connected to business metrics, attrition retention product.

119
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,608
Tivity health care costs.

120
00:28:11,908 --> 00:28:43,708
So the reason why I am optimistic despite all the Dreadful numbers you cited is because finally we're acknowledging a problem, and we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix it and the fact that the majorities of employees and the c-suite, executives think that their life is more important than their career, it makes me feel like saying dada Shouldn't have known that for a while.

121
00:28:43,708 --> 00:29:01,108
We love our jobs and know the three of us really feel very blessed that we are doing jobs that we are passionate about but our jobs more important than Joe's little girl or your child or my children or the rest of our lives.

122
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:19,308
And for many, many years people acted, as though climbing the career ladder was more important than Anything, including their own health and withstand the skyrocketing increases in mental health problems, diabetes, obesity, Etc.

123
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:21,508
You know, Ariana.

124
00:29:21,508 --> 00:29:35,608
I just want to follow up on that and like, 100%, I think that there was a point in time, when burnout working till 2:00 3:00 in the morning, was a sign of honor.

125
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:38,408
It was like, I work hard, I work hard at all expenses.

126
00:29:38,408 --> 00:29:45,408
Like, especially when you work at a company that's growing and thriving and trying to run after the opportunity.

127
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:52,608
Many times it was like, honored, like this person is working hard and what I have realized as a leader with a family.

128
00:29:52,608 --> 00:30:00,508
Now, and my priorities are changing is like that actually isn't worth at the expense of all these other things in my life.

129
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:04,008
What are you seeing that change happen?

130
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:06,708
Like within leaders today and realizing that.

131
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,808
Okay, this is a burnout, I Am shifting.

132
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:15,408
Is there a shift you feel to prioritize mental health versus just like reporting that it's an issue?

133
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:16,808
Absolutely.

134
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:31,108
There is a shift and the shift is actually based on a scientific Foundation, which is that actually, when we take time to recharge to refuel to renew ourselves, we are more effective at work.

135
00:30:31,108 --> 00:30:35,908
So there is no trade-off which is what we believed for years and Elite.

136
00:30:35,908 --> 00:30:49,808
Athletes are at the Forefront who have Tom Brady speak about how prioritizing his sleep and what he eats and his recovery time has had Made it possible for him to win Super Bowls in his 40s.

137
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:56,608
And so, the connection between well-being and performance is now clear.

138
00:30:56,608 --> 00:31:14,408
We have really left behind, although we're still in a period of transition, the idea that downtime is a bug, and we realize that it may be a bag for software, but it's a feature for the human operating system.

139
00:31:15,108 --> 00:31:15,708
No Doubt.

140
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,308
Appreciate that Joe.

141
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:25,208
I mean, your dad now and I know we opened up with that, and I remember, this is what podcast recently, by the way, with juban, which is a phenomenal podcast.

142
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:43,308
If you guys haven't seen a grit from kind of Perkins, and you mentioned, like the importance of taking PTO, especially even as a leader, even as a CTO and taken parental leave, what was that like for like beating up to taking that break with a debt due for you and sort of the inner workings of that at your company.

143
00:31:44,008 --> 00:31:51,708
So first Want to say something back to Ariana really quickly, which is like the book you put out thrive in 2015.

144
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:53,408
I really do think as accelerated.

145
00:31:53,408 --> 00:32:11,008
The common lexicon that we have to be more preventative and how we kind of approach things like burnout, right burnout wasn't really a word you were diagnosed with it in 2007, you're like, what is that whereas in 2015 or 2020 to it is actually a commonly understood term.

146
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:15,408
And so if you just even understand what the concept is, you can start to be more preventive with it.

147
00:32:15,408 --> 00:32:24,908
And so, I think that's where it really does tie in well, with paternity leave because to me I was very nervous about taking extended time off.

148
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:29,808
It would be the first time and six and a half years that I took longer than a week, long vacation.

149
00:32:30,108 --> 00:32:39,808
And ultimately, I came back on the other side of paternity leave feeling like I had recharged the tank in a way that I hadn't since the very beginning of Bloom.

150
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:45,908
And I have been a significantly better CEO, even with having a brand-new born.

151
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:49,708
With in my household day in and day out for the last three months.

152
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:53,408
Since then, like you would think that I would become a worse or less productive.

153
00:32:53,408 --> 00:32:56,808
CEO knows like the opposite because not only was it.

154
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,408
I had the time off that allowed for me to recharge the batteries.

155
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:06,108
It's also allowed for me to kind of be what I would say in terms of being a father.

156
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:09,008
I talked about this concept of like Ambien anxiety.

157
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:12,908
Is like how am I spending my time outside of work?

158
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,808
And, you know, that you can't work 24/7.

159
00:33:14,808 --> 00:33:19,108
So it's like, what are you for down, time to go like workout and exercise?

160
00:33:19,108 --> 00:33:21,008
Do you sit down and have dinner with your spouse?

161
00:33:21,008 --> 00:33:29,208
Do you end up doing the lazy thing, which is Doom scrolling on social media, like all of these sorts of things that you may spend your time?

162
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,608
Obviously, some of those are stacked ranked, very differently.

163
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:45,908
But any time that I spend with my family, while I do my wife and my daughter, there's none of that no anxiety, no guilt and so the recharge that I get since having a child and then being able to come back and show up at work, the like my battery is recharged.

164
00:33:46,008 --> 00:33:48,608
Is better than it ever has been before at Loom.

165
00:33:48,608 --> 00:34:00,808
And so taking time off, spending time with family, enables me to be a better CEO and I have 3 months of data now, so I will check back in a year to be like and it's still true but like as of today it is definitely true.

166
00:34:01,908 --> 00:34:02,708
Fantastic.

167
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:03,808
You know, you know what's interesting.

168
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:07,808
Joe, I think you know, we always hear about Lee from the top.

169
00:34:07,908 --> 00:34:12,108
So like what you sort of like, do you know, your employees follow as well?

170
00:34:12,108 --> 00:34:14,208
And I think this is one of those things, right?

171
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,507
Like taking a month, off taken, three months off, whatever.

172
00:34:16,507 --> 00:34:17,208
I mean, whatever.

173
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,507
That looks like it's important.

174
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:19,808
All right.

175
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:26,308
So as something balanced armatures on a Segway into that, right, like, let us talk about thriving at work.

176
00:34:26,507 --> 00:34:36,308
And I think, you know, as Leaders, we all want each teammate, at our companies, to thrive, to be, well, to do the best work.

177
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:40,708
But saying in actually supporting it is two different things.

178
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:42,507
We can say that all we want.

179
00:34:42,608 --> 00:34:45,908
And then on top of that, we're in a remote first world.

180
00:34:46,108 --> 00:34:48,108
And this is brings a lot of change.

181
00:34:49,108 --> 00:34:50,208
What does that look like?

182
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:53,007
How do we be more attention about supporting our employees?

183
00:34:54,208 --> 00:35:00,808
For now, we may, we may never see in the office or it's going to be much more or less frequent than ever before.

184
00:35:00,908 --> 00:35:04,208
This is these are the screens that we engage with them on.

185
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:11,008
Why have you seen work on like empowering employees, to take care of themselves?

186
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:14,108
Outside of just like, showing by example?

187
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:19,208
Ariana.

188
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:38,408
I think that first of all, what you said about all these new practices starting at the top is incredibly important because we are still in the middle of a cultural transition.

189
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:46,208
And so, a lot of people feel they need cultural permission to take care of themselves.

190
00:35:46,808 --> 00:36:12,008
And when we launched with any company, we like to bring into a blood from stories from their leaders about how they are recharging, even small things that we just launched at Paramount and Bob Beckel, their CEO told the story at the fireside chat that we launched with of how he used to go straight to his phone.

191
00:36:12,508 --> 00:36:15,708
And now he takes five minutes.

192
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:18,508
He lives by a He makes a cup of coffee.

193
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:37,008
Go sit on his porch said, saying that his intention for the day and remembers what he's grateful for and then goes through his phone now, that small and in fact, I drive, we talked, we talked about micro steps.

194
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:43,808
Small daily incremental, steps that become gradually healthier habits.

195
00:36:44,408 --> 00:36:46,408
And that way, it's not overwhelming.

196
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:52,908
Me and that micro step of how you start your day and how you end your day?

197
00:36:54,108 --> 00:37:09,608
By as Joe said, instead of Doom's crawling doing something that connects you with your family or recharges you before you go to sleep, are absolutely key micro steps.

198
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:14,508
Now Ariana like let us talk about how do you bring that into the workplace?

199
00:37:14,508 --> 00:37:21,008
Because we talked about a lot of mental health, for you, the individual, and we talked about humanizing the workplace and what that looks like.

200
00:37:21,008 --> 00:37:31,808
And I love to segue right into Thrive because you talked about bringing your personal self, your host self and sharing a glimpse of what really matters to you as an employee of a bigger company.

201
00:37:33,008 --> 00:37:33,908
Why don't we can you?

202
00:37:33,908 --> 00:37:34,808
Can you just T up?

203
00:37:34,808 --> 00:37:37,408
What, what, what our Thrive resets?

204
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:45,608
And then got a little bit, surprised I have a reset Ricky said I have my reset and it'd be good to kind of give the audience a glimpse of what resets our go.

205
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:48,908
I would love for you to introduce it and talk about the science behind it.

206
00:37:49,508 --> 00:38:03,508
So I thrive our Behavior change methodology is based on meeting employees, whatever they are on teams on slack, on welcome, whatever medium they're using.

207
00:38:03,508 --> 00:38:04,508
We want to meet them.

208
00:38:04,508 --> 00:38:34,808
They're both with this micro steps around, sleep Food Connection, Ian Focus, but also with the 62nd interventions that we call reset which are based on the Neuroscience that tells us that while stress is unavoidable, cumulative, stress is avoidable and it takes 60 seconds to move us from the sympathetic to the parasympathetic nervous system.

209
00:38:35,508 --> 00:38:45,008
And therefore interrupt that cycle that, if it's not interrupted can To high blood pressure or binge drinking or binge eating to be able to wind down.

210
00:38:45,008 --> 00:38:57,608
So my favorite feature in our platform as Roberto, you know, is reset because you bring together things that you love about your life.

211
00:38:57,608 --> 00:39:00,908
And whenever you are stressed, you played.

212
00:39:00,908 --> 00:39:25,808
Also, we believe that the we played at the beginning of meetings, to build social capital who literally spinning wheel and One of us plays there reset and it gives us a glimpse as we're going to see now into a colleagues life that helps us build the social capital that we lose when we are not all physically together.

213
00:39:25,808 --> 00:39:26,808
Bumping into each.

214
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:33,408
Other asking each other more intimate questions about our lives are weak and Etc.

215
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:34,808
Fantastic.

216
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:40,308
I mean with that if we can roll the clip of Ariana's, and then we will switch over to my reset as well.

217
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:15,108
We just saw a little bit of a glimpse Ariana to your reset.

218
00:40:15,608 --> 00:40:19,308
I love seeing that let us play minds, and then we will talk about it here in a second.

219
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:02,008
There it is, there it is.

220
00:41:02,608 --> 00:41:03,008
Joe.

221
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:08,608
Yeah, I mean do we gonna have to get yours going next time and would love to see your family?

222
00:41:09,308 --> 00:41:15,808
But Ariana that's I mean I just think about that was pooling photos last night together to kind of get the reset going.

223
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:17,708
But yeah, talk to us about that.

224
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:21,208
How has it been received who companies that you're working with your team?

225
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:22,308
What's what changes?

226
00:41:24,408 --> 00:41:37,408
People love it and you know you can have multiple resets share them with colleagues and friends and you can build research for your children, your family.

227
00:41:37,808 --> 00:41:45,708
It's a very simple way to start this journey of well-being or to add these well-being practice into your life.

228
00:41:45,708 --> 00:42:14,308
You know, in the Paul people said that they have these little well-being Rituals once a day or once a week, or once a month, but you can have them once an hour and if you bring them into your workflow and interrupt the stress cycle, and it can be incredibly effective and Thrive we bring them into call centers.

229
00:42:14,308 --> 00:42:18,408
We bring them into the lives of Frontline workers.

230
00:42:18,408 --> 00:42:42,308
It's not just for people with desk jobs and the I can't play this resets on the phones and also everything comes pre-loaded with, with ready-made resets where thing over play one at the end that helps us take the breath.

231
00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:44,908
Remember what we're grateful for etcetera?

232
00:42:46,008 --> 00:42:46,608
Fantastic.

233
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:47,208
Now, I love it.

234
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:52,808
I mean I just saw Minds come together for today's event, and I am looking forward to it.

235
00:42:52,808 --> 00:43:01,008
I just I want to keep it shortcut on my phone because you guys know things, get pretty tense at the top and it's good to Anchor back to what's important.

236
00:43:03,508 --> 00:43:11,908
All right, so I want to jump into Switching gears here and Joe, you talk about something, which I think you wrote, You have right about this.

237
00:43:11,908 --> 00:43:21,108
You talked about this and it's talking about the change of what's happening with remote and employees that are now distributed.

238
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:26,308
And the importance of us understanding that work is fundamentally changing.

239
00:43:27,308 --> 00:43:35,508
You know, I think if you look at work being no longer a place you go to But it's something that you do now.

240
00:43:35,508 --> 00:43:37,908
If we just anchor on that for a second, right?

241
00:43:38,108 --> 00:43:39,408
Work is no longer a place.

242
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,308
You go to, but it's something that you do.

243
00:43:41,408 --> 00:43:45,908
Historically, you would think generationally, you know, Dad goes to work.

244
00:43:45,908 --> 00:43:48,708
Mom goes to work, like they're going to work.

245
00:43:48,808 --> 00:43:57,008
Now you're literally, you are where you are and you do the work and the tip, the question becomes, how do we do that?

246
00:43:57,008 --> 00:44:02,908
Well, you know, our friend Stewart Butterfield over a slack says we only have about 10% of the tools.

247
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:07,108
Needed to do this well and serve this shift in the market.

248
00:44:07,408 --> 00:44:16,608
You would argue that slack all of us use slack and it's the thing that connects all of us but even the leader and the CEO of slack says, we're just scratching.

249
00:44:16,608 --> 00:44:20,708
The surface is only 10% of the tools needed to do the job.

250
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:28,408
Well, and then as we talk about the headlines, you know, there's a headline every single week company is announcing their own remote.

251
00:44:28,408 --> 00:44:31,808
Other companies saying, you have to show up or else, right?

252
00:44:31,808 --> 00:44:32,908
And there's like that.

253
00:44:33,308 --> 00:44:35,208
A war happening right now.

254
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:39,208
And some people think that hybrid might be the worst of Both Worlds.

255
00:44:39,308 --> 00:44:47,808
And some people are like, no, like in offices where it's at, some people are very Progressive, and they're saying, we're going all in on remote where do you stand?

256
00:44:48,008 --> 00:44:48,708
This is open.

257
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:49,608
Question for both of you.

258
00:44:49,608 --> 00:44:56,208
Where do you stand, what's your thoughts on like hybrid and remote is remote more Equitable as hybrid?

259
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:56,908
What's your current take?

260
00:44:56,908 --> 00:44:59,608
As I know you guys are on the front lines of that yourself.

261
00:45:00,508 --> 00:45:02,408
So I will do a little preamble.

262
00:45:03,108 --> 00:45:03,408
Room.

263
00:45:03,408 --> 00:45:18,408
And one of our original thesis for building what we were building because I do think it's relevant just in terms of thematically what we're all navigating, which is when we built a synchronous video for the workplace, that was what we launched in June of 2016, right?

264
00:45:18,408 --> 00:45:23,608
So this was three and a half years in advance of covid and everybody being shelter in place.

265
00:45:23,608 --> 00:45:27,908
And really, truly understanding, what is feasible with remote work.

266
00:45:27,908 --> 00:45:33,108
And so are, we always said that we're not necessarily a remote.

267
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:39,408
Only tool, although we are very valuable for those who are communicating in a remote context because we were growing really well.

268
00:45:39,408 --> 00:45:45,808
And folks were using us, even if they were in office because you know, it's hybrid as a full spectrum, right?

269
00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:48,008
It is you're a hybrid company.

270
00:45:48,008 --> 00:45:56,108
If you have every single person in office, but one person decides to work from home for per day, or you are still a hybrid company.

271
00:45:56,108 --> 00:46:01,108
If everybody is fully remote, but then we get to people who go into the office once or twice per week.

272
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:01,708
I like that.

273
00:46:01,808 --> 00:46:17,708
That's still technically a Hybrid and so for us when we, when we were thinking about, what is this change, that we are all navigating in the first and second quarter of 2020, when we were all just thinking about, what does this mean for us as individuals?

274
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,108
What does it mean for our company's?

275
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:26,308
What does it mean for potentially the products that we're building in order to help facilitate distributed and remote teams in communicating with one another?

276
00:46:27,808 --> 00:46:31,908
I kept reminding the company that this is a multi-decade change.

277
00:46:32,108 --> 00:46:34,708
Like we're not going to Of the wand and figure this out.

278
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:39,608
Because when we go back into office, when we go back home, how often receive one another?

279
00:46:39,608 --> 00:46:53,608
Like these are really big long scale and large experiments that were generally running right now and Humanity doesn't necessarily change overnight when we're talking about the global population and how they think about the intersection of work and life.

280
00:46:53,908 --> 00:47:11,408
And so for us and Loom, the way that we personally think about it right now is we want to live the idealistic of version of this like we It to push for what is what we believe that Ideal World is where, like work is not what, like, where you are, it's what you do.

281
00:47:11,608 --> 00:47:14,008
And so how do you end up enabling that?

282
00:47:14,008 --> 00:47:25,508
It's that you enable individuals to have as much freedom and flexibility as possible because you actually fundamentally trust that individuals are going to adhere to whatever is best for them.

283
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:34,408
If that means going into the office, once a quarter, then and working at home for the rest of the time, like, I Mean please do that.

284
00:47:34,408 --> 00:47:37,708
And how frequently do you want to get together with the broad company?

285
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:39,308
Or your department, or your team?

286
00:47:39,508 --> 00:47:43,808
Like, we're all figuring that out right now, but ultimately what that is fundamentally rooted in.

287
00:47:44,008 --> 00:47:51,508
If you treat the individual with trust then you can enable them with freedom and flexibility, and we will figure out how to do that over the course of time.

288
00:47:51,608 --> 00:48:02,908
Now there is a whole host of hairy challenges that we gotta tackle over the next couple decades, like I was saying and Stewart Butterfield is also talking about the fact that like we are at 10% of the tooling that we potentially need to.

289
00:48:03,108 --> 00:48:10,308
Be able to solve this, what we wanted to live, the ideal version and what we want to help pull that potential ideal future into the present as quickly as possible.

290
00:48:12,508 --> 00:48:15,608
Fantastic well-well, put Ariana.

291
00:48:19,808 --> 00:48:21,408
Okay, Ned one thing.

292
00:48:21,408 --> 00:48:40,508
If it were not just a 10% of the technology we need, I think we are a 10% of the humanity because one of the things that we are realizing is that we are not going to be able to figure it all out and deal with his hairy challenges.

293
00:48:40,508 --> 00:48:49,408
If we think everything is going to be solved by technology, I think technology can help us ironically Rico.

294
00:48:49,608 --> 00:48:53,008
Act with a deeper part of ourselves as we are doing with reset.

295
00:48:53,008 --> 00:48:57,508
So, you are doing with them, welcome platform or the loom platform.

296
00:48:57,508 --> 00:49:07,908
But we need to reconnect to a deeper part of ourselves where we can find our creativity, our empathy, our peace, and strength, and resilience.

297
00:49:08,308 --> 00:49:19,408
And if we don't do that, the future is going to be very difficult because we are living in extremely uncertain, and turbulent times, there is absolutely nothing.

298
00:49:19,508 --> 00:49:25,908
Thing that assures us that's going to change.

299
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:39,008
So resilience is more important than ever but it's a human quality, and I am a big believer in technology, helping us get there.

300
00:49:39,308 --> 00:49:45,608
But we need to realize that this human upscaling has to be part of the future.

301
00:49:47,108 --> 00:49:56,608
I couldn't by the way, in terms of resiliency, I think that we all kind of like see and feel it right now where we just came out of a multi-year global pandemic.

302
00:49:56,608 --> 00:50:04,008
And now we're about to go into potentially a multi-year global recession based off of like all leading indicators at this point.

303
00:50:04,008 --> 00:50:10,608
So, when it comes to resiliency, like another, we feel like we just got sucked through something so big.

304
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:16,208
But on the other side of it, where, like, potentially facing another major change will impact our day-to-day.

305
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:17,008
Lives as well.

306
00:50:17,008 --> 00:50:22,608
And so resiliency just wanted to like, triple emphasize with Arianna said is, I think it's so important.

307
00:50:23,108 --> 00:50:23,908
No doubt.

308
00:50:24,008 --> 00:50:36,908
And I think, you know, I think the conversation we're having here about work, but also the people side of it, just goes hand-in-hand, and I feel like over the last few years has become so much more important about employee well-being.

309
00:50:37,308 --> 00:50:46,108
Like the person that you provide space to come to do the work, not just like the skills that they provide, but the individual and Joe, I think you put it really well.

310
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:55,708
Well, around optimizing for the person when you optimize for the employee, when you optimize for the person, if they want to come in once a quarter.

311
00:50:55,708 --> 00:51:00,808
And that's the best thing for them than having to trust that, that's the best thing for them.

312
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:04,108
And the question is, how do you support that and make that habit?

313
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:20,108
You know, one of the biggest arguments that we see or might be, might be fading away now since data showing otherwise, that going remote, having folks choose nice, Lisa and If impact on connection and culture within a company, right?

314
00:51:20,108 --> 00:51:28,808
That's one side of the argument is like, well, if I don't have, I built my coaching because there's a good micro kitchen because, you know, we got all these perks.

315
00:51:28,808 --> 00:51:30,608
You can take the slide from the third floor.

316
00:51:30,608 --> 00:51:35,808
Down to the first floor, you can take a cool bike from one office to another office when that goes away.

317
00:51:36,108 --> 00:51:38,908
And this is the beauty of I think about like, the shift that's happening.

318
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:46,108
Because when that goes away, leaders and companies have to think very differently about what matters to the employee.

319
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:46,508
Lee.

320
00:51:46,608 --> 00:51:57,908
And I think also, when you look at all these circumstances that were talking about pandemic War recession, if we're all honest, we have taken inventory of what's important for us in our lives.

321
00:51:58,408 --> 00:52:00,508
And data is starting to show that as well.

322
00:52:01,608 --> 00:52:03,208
What do you guys think it's possible?

323
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:13,408
You guys think it's possible for us as we're going more remote, more distributed to still build amazing, cultures, amazing companies and enable people feel connected.

324
00:52:14,908 --> 00:52:16,008
Absolutely.

325
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:16,808
Yes.

326
00:52:17,808 --> 00:52:24,008
I think Joe said it best that it's not really about where you work.

327
00:52:27,508 --> 00:52:31,408
I think it's really how we show up at every moment in our lives.

328
00:52:31,408 --> 00:52:32,908
How present are we?

329
00:52:33,808 --> 00:52:35,208
How fully engaged?

330
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:35,608
Are we?

331
00:52:35,608 --> 00:52:47,408
You know, in something you said, Roberto you have one of my favorite quotes by Maya Angelou, you should add it into your next reset.

332
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:51,708
The wisest thing you can do is be present in the present.

333
00:52:51,808 --> 00:52:52,708
Gratefully.

334
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:56,808
That's a very different way of experiencing life.

335
00:52:56,908 --> 00:52:57,708
Find work.

336
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:02,508
Then we have been used to, which is Being not at all.

337
00:53:02,508 --> 00:53:16,208
In the present breathlessly you know living life as though we're always running out of time and that's been the experience that I grew up with.

338
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:23,408
You know, I am older than all of you but I don't think yours has been that different and now we are changing that.

339
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:27,108
So this is kind of incredible Catalyst.

340
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:30,608
You know how someone said that Christ is a terrible thing to waste.

341
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:41,708
So let us not waste this crisis and last, let us be incredibly optimistic about what we are building because who wants to go back to the past?

342
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:44,408
Fantastic.

343
00:53:44,908 --> 00:53:54,808
And I was just going to say really quickly, that, you know, we're a lot of folks say that time is the most precious resource, which I agree, but I would like argue that we should extend it to.

344
00:53:54,808 --> 00:54:01,408
It's more like attention and intention of where you end up, allocating your focus.

345
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:16,308
And so that whole being present in the present is such a gift that I think that in terms of building connection and community in a largely distributed world, I still think that were humans and biology.

346
00:54:16,308 --> 00:54:24,408
Like, it takes a very long time for like biology to evolve and so there's a very real half-life that comes from getting a group of folks together.

347
00:54:24,408 --> 00:54:52,208
Like, I was fortunate enough to get to spend time with Ariana at the loom off site a couple weeks ago, where we got everybody together for the first time in two and a half years and it was 30 minutes into the welcome kind of like happy hour horderves time that illuminates were just head over heels in terms of spending time with one another Either, but I think that what's really exciting about things like off sites when you're primarily distributed is that you have the intention of creating what I think is like, accelerates.

348
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:56,108
Building of relationships, which is unique shared experiences.

349
00:54:56,308 --> 00:55:05,008
If you can have a unique shared experiences with another or group of other people, then you can build really accelerated connection and Community across a group.

350
00:55:05,008 --> 00:55:13,208
So even if you only get together within your team or Department once every six months and then a company, once a year, the half-life of the value of that is so strong.

351
00:55:13,408 --> 00:55:25,708
A digital actually can enable you to build connection and community in a way that I think that we're just scratching the surface onto its Shameless plug a sink video is an unbelievably powerful way to build connection and Community.

352
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:33,308
I could show you our Loom work space where somebody was sharing a video from Loom, a couple of years ago that now has gone viral.

353
00:55:33,308 --> 00:55:34,008
In our workspace.

354
00:55:34,008 --> 00:55:40,908
That a bunch of folks is watching where we make it a hot wing challenge together and like that is then getting a bunch of other illuminates to talk about.

355
00:55:40,908 --> 00:55:45,808
They have done the hot wing challenge together and so all of this connection and Community is being built asynchronously.

356
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:55,108
So I think we're just scratching the surface there, but I really do think that intention around unique shared experiences, you're going to absolutely do both and digital and physical worlds.

357
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:58,408
No doubt, no doubt, loves this conversation.

358
00:55:58,408 --> 00:56:01,308
I do want to shift over to the audience.

359
00:56:01,308 --> 00:56:05,108
It looks like we have a lot of questions, queued up in the audience.

360
00:56:05,108 --> 00:56:07,908
We're going to start shifting gears on that side.

361
00:56:08,008 --> 00:56:12,808
And so, I think for the next few minutes, we're going to start taking some questions.

362
00:56:13,008 --> 00:56:15,808
So why don't we go ahead and bring question up on stage?

363
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:25,808
I love to hear ideas on how we encourage employees to build and maintain those connections when several are remote or hype.

364
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:43,208
I think this goes back to, you know, like I don't see all my peers, I don't see all my colleagues all the time I used to bump into them, you know, at the micro kitchen and now people are distributed, or I am working from Boston and you know our team I have one of my leaders is in Hawaii.

365
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:46,808
Another one of my leaders was in Poland last week, I am in Boston.

366
00:56:46,808 --> 00:56:48,708
Now what does that look like?

367
00:56:48,908 --> 00:56:52,208
Are you guys seeing like effective ways of building that connection?

368
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:57,808
I mean Joe you talked about, you know, async videos and sort of The building connection, can we expand on that?

369
00:56:57,808 --> 00:57:00,808
Because that feels like a good segue into this one.

370
00:57:02,008 --> 00:57:21,608
Yeah, I mean I think that it starts from the very beginning of an employee life cycle where a very popular use cases that instead of somebody sending an introductory like two or three sentence note, somebody is that true required on day, one to record a loom introducing themselves, and we have lumet intros and so that sent a bunch of people leave reactions.

371
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:24,508
They're actually like know where that person lived over the course of time.

372
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:28,308
And like, do they have a dog or a cat like what's their General interests?

373
00:57:28,308 --> 00:57:35,708
And so, watching a video of somebody walking through that with, like, Men passion about what they are, what are the things that they genuinely care about?

374
00:57:35,708 --> 00:58:09,208
I think is super, super powerful, and then from there, if you kind of create the opportunity for people to bring their whole selves, to work and sharing things of interest to them, one of the things that Ariana really did want to, we have to follow through on a loom specifically, but one of the things that you shared when you're up on stage, is the fact that you ask employees what matters most to them and it was crazy when you were hiring a certain employee at I have where they had said that they weren't able to do that for six months and at Thrive you're like no, no, you're doing this like every week right in.

375
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:14,508
So like, understanding what is generally interesting to an individual is so important.

376
00:58:14,508 --> 00:58:27,308
And so what we need to follow through on with loom is that I said at the off-site you need to pick one other person to be your accountability partner to make sure that you check in and making sure that individual is doing what they're supposed to be doing over the course of time.

377
00:58:27,308 --> 00:58:38,508
Like, Josh when is an engineer at Loom, and he and I decided to partner up, and he said She wanted to spend time talking to every single one of his family members each week, because he feels like he's drifted apart over the last year.

378
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:42,408
And so like that, brings him a lot of energy and joy if he just gives them a call.

379
00:58:43,008 --> 00:58:51,508
So this is one where I think that to me, I said that my practice was meditating for at least 15 minutes per day because it's my leading indicator behavior.

380
00:58:51,908 --> 00:58:54,308
And it's obviously, you know what to do.

381
00:58:54,308 --> 00:58:55,508
But do you do it in practice?

382
00:58:55,508 --> 00:59:08,908
And so, if you understand what's really important at an individual level, than you can build deeper relationships with them, over the course of time, I am 100% I want to follow up on that because Ariana you told me the same thing and I can't shake it from my head.

383
00:59:08,908 --> 00:59:20,108
It was I remember when we were having a conversation couple months ago, and we're talking about the importance of getting to know your employees and the first question you ask you flip it around and is not what can you do?

384
00:59:20,108 --> 00:59:22,408
But what is most important for you in the season?

385
00:59:22,408 --> 00:59:31,608
And we went off and talking about examples of that and let us say, for instance, you know, you have a mom who was a busy mom, and she's the most important.

386
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:37,308
In her life right now is her daughter's recital and the practice that happens for the next three months.

387
00:59:37,308 --> 00:59:43,708
For that to happen, which means that I can't really attend, you know, Friday, 2:00 meetings.

388
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:50,908
And so now as a manager, I know that for Samantha, that is the most important thing that matters to her in the season.

389
00:59:50,908 --> 00:59:52,008
So, I am not going to require.

390
00:59:52,008 --> 00:59:54,708
I am not even going to book a time on a meeting, on the front, by the way.

391
00:59:54,708 --> 01:00:01,508
Friday meeting shouldn't exist, but I am not going to book a meeting on a Friday afternoon for Samantha because I know that's the most important thing.

392
01:00:01,608 --> 01:00:07,608
NG for her, but it seems like Joe's taken that advice as well, pretty tactically Ariana.

393
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:09,008
Can you expand on that a little bit more?

394
01:00:09,008 --> 01:00:09,208
Yeah.

395
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:16,808
Actually it's going goes back to a Joe said about the need to be much more intentional in a hybrid world.

396
01:00:17,308 --> 01:00:31,208
And for us, it starts with onboarding with all the companies who work with, whether they are Walmart or a small, high-growth startup onboarding is sacred.

397
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:31,508
Now.

398
01:00:32,108 --> 01:00:33,608
It's the opportunity.

399
01:00:33,608 --> 01:00:39,008
We have to embed the culture from day one.

400
01:00:39,508 --> 01:00:49,308
So we interview the entry interview starts with his questionable.

401
01:00:49,308 --> 01:01:13,808
If you both mention which is quite important to you, I don't work and how can afford so it can be What's important to me take my daughter to school every morning at 7 or to go to the my daughter's recital on Friday after whatever it is make it even larger.

402
01:01:14,108 --> 01:01:29,208
You can actually And the way you interact with that employee, and if you also have an accountability buddy, then it makes it much more likely that you're going to achieve your goals.

403
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:38,108
And then you're going to be much happier at work and much less stressed about navigating this intersection between life and work.

404
01:01:38,108 --> 01:01:58,608
And what we do on day, one is also helped each new employee create their own personalized reset And that way that's a tool that we have to play a team meeting to play individually by feeding it into slack or team, so or any method of communication.

405
01:01:58,908 --> 01:02:08,108
And these are two of the small rituals, there are dozens of others that we can embed in the workflow to interrupt the stress cycle.

406
01:02:09,908 --> 01:02:10,708
Fantastic know.

407
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:12,708
I think that's, that's a such a powerful question.

408
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:15,608
So, simple, Joe is such a simple question, right?

409
01:02:15,608 --> 01:02:21,808
But when you like dissect, it was like this game-changing, like just starting with what's most important to that individual.

410
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:27,208
I want to segue into this next question which is a real good one.

411
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:31,308
Especially in the tension of remote and hybrid from Howard.

412
01:02:31,308 --> 01:02:51,508
He says, curious as to how ad-hoc hallway and water cooler conversations can be recreated in this hybrid world and I remember My time at what time I Google I you know, how always goes our micro kitchen because it was a fantastic place to load up on snacks, but also make coffee or whatever it is and you do bump into people, right?

413
01:02:51,508 --> 01:02:57,008
And you do get the sense of like Community because you see the folks that you're working with.

414
01:02:57,908 --> 01:03:00,408
How are you guys handling that at your company's?

415
01:03:04,908 --> 01:03:18,708
So this one I think is like, really challenging specifically because, yeah, in the sense that what are the very nuanced human engagements and interactions that happen in office.

416
01:03:19,108 --> 01:03:32,908
That I think that like we were saying we're two years into a multi-decade change and so what problems are being solved today, it's the biggest ones that are lined to the most direct Roi for a business, right?

417
01:03:32,908 --> 01:03:39,508
So like, can I communicate Directly uncritical work streams, can I actually drive a project forward?

418
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:44,508
But some things like, the Nuance interaction around water coolers or hallway, talk.

419
01:03:44,508 --> 01:03:46,508
I think is one that will absolutely be solved.

420
01:03:46,508 --> 01:03:53,508
I think that, you know, I could continue to talk about Loom but like I will talk about a few other ones where slack built something called the Huddle's, right?

421
01:03:53,508 --> 01:03:57,808
So that makes it very easy to potentially like jump into a quick call.

422
01:03:57,808 --> 01:04:04,308
There's other software's out there like team flow or tandem or uncheck gathered at Town.

423
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:14,908
Town that allows that tries to make it a little bit more 3D where you can walk around and be in an office setting to like run into folks throughout even if you're engaging in a digital space.

424
01:04:14,908 --> 01:04:20,708
And, so I think that there's a long way to go to potentially solve on this front and that we don't necessarily have it today.

425
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:30,408
The way that Loom is doing it specifically is that we're asynchronous by Nature so folks can record and share a video, but then we built this concept of trending within a workspace.

426
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:36,108
And so depending on what Loom is getting Emoji, reacted With and comments, right?

427
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:45,808
And a lot of times the loons that Trend are not directly work-related their actual cultural related so illuminates decided to start doing plant tours around their home.

428
01:04:45,808 --> 01:04:49,108
So they're like two or three minutes where they'd show off the plants at their home.

429
01:04:49,108 --> 01:04:57,308
And now we have 40 plant tours across the loom workspace and a genuinely became the interesting thing about culture as like the remix component.

430
01:04:57,308 --> 01:05:00,508
So at the beginning it was a full five-minute Plant tour by the Yen.

431
01:05:00,508 --> 01:05:04,408
People were doing the fastest plant tours east of the Mississippi, and so they were like running.

432
01:05:04,508 --> 01:05:06,508
Earning around their hive and like this plant, this plant.

433
01:05:06,508 --> 01:05:15,608
And, so I think that to me, there're ways of you would an asynchronous way, but ultimately I think that those like creative Innovative bouncing conversations off of each other.

434
01:05:15,808 --> 01:05:22,008
We still got a long way to go to solve that problem but I do see software's that are trying to tackle it, and they're really, really interesting.

435
01:05:22,008 --> 01:05:23,608
So just a little bit more time.

436
01:05:24,108 --> 01:05:24,508
Yeah.

437
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:25,808
No doubt, no doubt.

438
01:05:25,808 --> 01:05:26,408
Joe I live.

439
01:05:26,408 --> 01:05:34,308
I love the long term perspective to the problem that you're bringing here, I think it's really important to understand that we're just in the very beginning.

440
01:05:34,508 --> 01:05:39,608
It's of his big Monumental shift in the way that we work and that is really important, right?

441
01:05:39,608 --> 01:05:45,908
For all of us, not just as Leaders, but also employees in the workforce that we're adapting we have to change.

442
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:46,908
This is part of it.

443
01:05:47,008 --> 01:05:47,208
Yeah.

444
01:05:47,308 --> 01:05:57,708
The two things I would share is like give ourselves a Grace and feel like every idea doesn't work because that they're not going to work and it's like an experiment mindset, just be willing to try things.

445
01:05:58,008 --> 01:06:03,108
I didn't like, don't get to turn by if it doesn't work because they are hard problems.

446
01:06:03,108 --> 01:06:04,308
So like just keep that.

447
01:06:04,408 --> 01:06:06,608
Experimentation mindset and keep testing things.

448
01:06:07,308 --> 01:06:25,208
That's actually one of the paradoxes, we need a long-term mindset, we need Grace, but we also need a sense of urgency because the Mental Health crisis is real, and a lot of people are suffering, and so we need to address it.

449
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:27,008
That's why I am so grateful.

450
01:06:27,008 --> 01:06:44,008
You both signed the mental health pledge which was basically put together by Thrive and Society of Human Resources management to protect their mental health advances that we have made in the last two years at a time.

451
01:06:44,008 --> 01:06:53,708
When we know companies have to make tough decisions layoffs, hiring freezes and cats to protect cash.

452
01:06:53,708 --> 01:07:11,908
Let us not cut on Mental Health offerings because that's been one of the advances of the last two years and it's Now, more important than ever because the Mental Health crisis is being described as the second pandemic.

453
01:07:13,508 --> 01:07:18,908
I mean, with that, I think I want to bring that up, start kind of getting us to a close Ariana.

454
01:07:19,108 --> 01:07:23,608
I mean, what you're bringing to the conversation is so timely, so meaningful.

455
01:07:23,608 --> 01:07:26,308
So human is so anchoring as well, right?

456
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:28,908
It's like kind of shaking it off as I guess I have a meeting.

457
01:07:28,908 --> 01:07:29,708
Yes, I have a to do.

458
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:30,308
Yes, I do.

459
01:07:30,308 --> 01:07:31,208
I am always going to have a meeting.

460
01:07:31,208 --> 01:07:32,608
I am always going to have a to do.

461
01:07:32,908 --> 01:07:34,208
But that person that's waiting.

462
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:35,408
On the couch.

463
01:07:35,608 --> 01:07:37,808
But I am choosing to Beyond another meeting.

464
01:07:37,808 --> 01:07:39,608
Another call another slack.

465
01:07:39,608 --> 01:07:45,808
Another document that person is waiting for me to go have dinner and that's more precious than anything else.

466
01:07:45,808 --> 01:07:46,008
Right?

467
01:07:46,008 --> 01:07:53,908
And I think that as we're in this shift Ariana, I think what you said is really, really important, we have Technologies, we can figure things out.

468
01:07:53,908 --> 01:07:55,208
Technology will get better.

469
01:07:55,208 --> 01:08:04,308
We will solve a lot of these issues, but I think us as humans adapting to this new change and us take an ownership as well of our mental.

470
01:08:04,408 --> 01:08:11,408
Oh, health and us as employers taking ownership of it as well for our employees, is really where the magic is going to happen.

471
01:08:12,008 --> 01:08:18,108
I want to before we close out with a reset and Ariana would love for you to kind of introduce a reset.

472
01:08:18,108 --> 01:08:20,008
This is more like a collective reset.

473
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:24,608
And this is part of us is exiting from today with a little bit more peace with a little bit.

474
01:08:24,608 --> 01:08:27,908
More being grounded before we go back to our families.

475
01:08:28,008 --> 01:08:31,408
Am I do want to remind everybody that in a few weeks?

476
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:33,508
We're going to be hosting another event here on.

477
01:08:33,508 --> 01:08:34,108
Welcome.

478
01:08:34,508 --> 01:08:35,808
Even the conversation going on.

479
01:08:35,808 --> 01:08:37,207
Changing how we work.

480
01:08:37,308 --> 01:08:43,508
And just featuring, Tony Jamis is the co-founder and CEO of oyster, and Chris heard founder.

481
01:08:43,508 --> 01:08:44,908
And CEO of First Base.

482
01:08:44,908 --> 01:08:52,308
These guys are on the front end of remote, and building companies that support that and making that happen.

483
01:08:52,308 --> 01:08:54,608
So please join us there, Ariana.

484
01:08:54,608 --> 01:09:06,808
And Joe again, thank you for not just spending your time, but also the intention of your presence here with everyone on the, on the call and on the ENT Ariana reset.

485
01:09:06,808 --> 01:09:08,608
We have a reset here for all of us to do.

486
01:09:08,608 --> 01:09:09,707
Why don't you bring us home?

487
01:09:09,707 --> 01:09:12,508
Will play the reset and I will see you guys in The Green Room.

488
01:09:13,008 --> 01:09:17,008
Well, first of all, well Robert, I want to thank you so much for bringing us together.

489
01:09:17,008 --> 01:09:25,308
This has been a wonderful event and I would go anywhere to be in conversation with Joe so that made it doubly wonderful.

490
01:09:26,108 --> 01:09:34,008
And you said something beautiful about those a person waiting for us beyond the to-do list beyond the meeting.

491
01:09:34,408 --> 01:09:35,908
I also want to remind us.

492
01:09:35,908 --> 01:09:47,207
There is another person waiting for us and that somebody inside ourselves and sometimes we forget that and you know thick not hand, the Buddhist monk said something beautiful.

493
01:09:47,207 --> 01:09:51,207
He said it's never been easier to run away from ourselves.

494
01:09:51,707 --> 01:09:53,608
There are so many distractions.

495
01:09:54,408 --> 01:09:59,608
It's so difficult to find even 60 seconds to be with ourselves.

496
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:08,408
So that's another function of reset that we are going to play now and there are hundreds of them on the Thrive platform.

497
01:10:08,908 --> 01:10:23,908
Take this moment to really just stay fully present gratefully, as Maya Angelou said, with ourselves and reconnect with ourselves, which makes it much easier to reconnect with anyone else.

498
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:25,308
Thank you, everyone.

499
01:10:26,508 --> 01:10:26,908
Thank you.

500
01:10:33,308 --> 01:10:34,108
Breathing.

501
01:10:36,908 --> 01:10:38,108
Breathe out.

502
01:10:42,908 --> 01:10:45,908
Time moves quickly, especially when we are so busy.

503
01:10:47,808 --> 01:10:51,308
But At this moment let us pause and take it slow.

504
01:10:53,308 --> 01:10:56,508
Bring your attention to the rising and falling of your breath.

505
01:10:58,508 --> 01:10:59,908
Appreciate the slowness.

506
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:04,608
Notice how your body feels when you allow yourself.

507
01:11:04,608 --> 01:11:06,708
This moment of calm and quiet.

508
01:11:11,408 --> 01:11:12,508
Throughout your Day.

509
01:11:13,008 --> 01:11:15,308
Let Yourself observe the world around you.

510
01:11:16,808 --> 01:11:19,408
And remember that each moment is a gift.

511
01:11:22,508 --> 01:11:23,408
Breathe in.

512
01:11:27,808 --> 01:11:28,908
Breathe out.
