00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,100
You know, some of us are just curious about your story.

53
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,100
Now, both of you are singer-songwriters from Louisiana, right?

54
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:03,900
Yes.

55
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,800
Tell us a little bit about your roots, you know, like Joven.

56
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,400
How did you get into music?

57
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:17,900
And we would love to hear the story of how you crushed American Idol auditions through the pandemic.

58
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,000
I mean, come on out.

59
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,600
That is it.

60
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,400
Incredible.

61
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,700
So, give us a little glimpse of your path.

62
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:32,600
How did, how did you get into music and how has Louisiana influenced you and Taylor feel free to jump into because I know you're from Louise, Louisiana as well.

63
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Um, basically my biggest influence would be Church.

64
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,600
My parents kept me in church when I was very young.

65
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:48,000
So just that's sold and culture of that from just Louisiana and general Inspire my soul to do the music I do today.

66
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,800
Awesome.

67
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,400
Awesome.

68
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,300
How about you Taylor?

69
00:10:52,900 --> 00:11:01,200
Yeah, for me, just being surrounded by the blend of country music and Soul music and gospel music, and southern rock music and all that things.

70
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,700
Just kind of came together into an amalgam of what I am doing now, rich.

71
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
So rich, we're excited to hear that.

72
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,600
So job and tell us a little bit about that.

73
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:28,300
Experience, auditioning for American Idol, through the pandemic, how, how that happened and have you been always trying to go after American Idol, like, we're their excellent amount of auditions that you had submitted before even getting to this.

74
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,000
Or was this your first time?

75
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,600
No, actually, I sent in an audition.

76
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:43,000
The year before is actually the year that lane Hardy won, and I was a little bit nervous to going from the judges or what the executives of that they had set forth.

77
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,900
So I sent in the video, and they actually liked it.

78
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:54,400
But at the time I wasn't really checking my email, so I missed that opportunity, but God had a plan to set me up for the next year.

79
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,500
So, I went in and just sing my butt off sweating, like I am doing now.

80
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,600
We're thicker email folks.

81
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,800
Basically check emails.

82
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,000
Well, yeah, that would that was not fun to miss that email.

83
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,900
I am sure I was crushed.

84
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,700
So then in 2020, how did you do the auditions?

85
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:24,200
Where you capture iPhone footage, selfie footage of yourself and submitting those like, what was that process?

86
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,600
Like, they sent those home from La.

87
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,400
Once they got the notice about the pandemic stuff, and they say, There's on the next day soon as we got there.

88
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,500
They start sending us equipment and start sending phone.

89
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,300
So we filmed the whole thing from three iPhone pros and that's how the show's made.

90
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,600
So I had to have family friends there just to help me do that.

91
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:53,100
Awesome about how many auditions did you do before you got in front of three, judges?

92
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,700
Oh God, I was like, at least for like six, at least.

93
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,900
Wow, so I did look, do a little traveling to went out to California.

94
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,500
First time.

95
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,400
I almost got left there.

96
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,700
That was interesting story.

97
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,800
What happened?

98
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:15,400
Basically my audition lasted longer than we were supposed to and I end up missing my flight and I had like a hundred bucks left to get home.

99
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,800
Yeah, that's another story.

100
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,300
Wow.

101
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,100
Okay, and what kind of tracks do you think?

102
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,500
You know, what was it about your sound that kept on advancing you through the auditions?

103
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,100
I don't know.

104
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,500
Thank you.

105
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,900
I guess everybody just kind of seen an and in heard of the pain in my voice and now he was authentic and it came from someone real, so they can relate to it.

106
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,000
So I am pretty sure everybody's been through a breakup.

107
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,400
So that's what the song was about.

108
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,300
Wow.

109
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:54,600
Yeah, I mean as a songwriter you have to pull from those deep experiences and emotions.

110
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,900
So with your sound that's what you have been able to.

111
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,400
Pull and really bring it out.

112
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,100
Well, that's awesome.

113
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,800
Are there any other questions from anyone in the audience?

114
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,100
Yeah, bring up some questions.

115
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:20,600
If you have any for jobin and throughout this event, if any of you, oh, who's the meanest judge?

116
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,200
None of them?

117
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,500
None of them.

118
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,000
They were, is that like you were dealing with Simon?

119
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,100
I mean, you did it with Katy Perry.

120
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,100
And she's like, bubbly, did see you got Uncle on an oh, that's kind of what it feels like to me.

121
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Uncle Lionel.

122
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:36,900
Right?

123
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,300
Right.

124
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,300
You look at Luke.

125
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,400
He's like, just a southern boy like us and feels like so, it was very a home feeling.

126
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,400
It wasn't like, I was meeting famous people even though they were megastars.

127
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:48,500
Yeah.

128
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,100
I mean, Katie had some pretty nice things to say about you.

129
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,800
And I mean, Lionel did to that one audition that you did in front of them.

130
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,200
What was that?

131
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,400
It?

132
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:06,400
What does that feel like just Going on to the American Idol stage, you have that, you know epic American Idol signage behind you?

133
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,900
How does that feel that whole experience?

134
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,900
It was a pretty nerve-wracking for what made the trip for me.

135
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,700
So crazy, just a whole journey.

136
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,200
I did the whole thing by myself.

137
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,600
So, when I traveled, I was by myself.

138
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,400
When I had to, you know, I was nervous.

139
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,100
I was by myself.

140
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
So, I was confiding myself.

141
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,500
Everybody else had somebody else.

142
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,900
So I was literally in a nutshell, freaking out, to be honest.

143
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,700
And something that didn't quite make.

144
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:46,100
The show was a I was outside a little nervous and I smoked the cigarette or something like that and I came in and I sing and I hug Kate, and she's like you a smoker.

145
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,500
I was like and Luke was that guy?

146
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,900
I think we need a smoker.

147
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,400
So that was like my biggest memories is like them asking me that it was like I was gonna need that grit that roughness.

148
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,100
So I don't know.

149
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,300
You just lied emotion that came out there one time and kind of blacked out for a minute.

150
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,500
Wow, that was a powerful audition.

151
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,400
Think a lot of us have seen that on YouTube.

152
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,200
All right, some questions here sod has asking what's your favorite City to play in?

153
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,500
Oh cool.

154
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,300
Is New Orleans.

155
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Alright flavor it?

156
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,400
Yes, the face is asking.

157
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,600
Who would you like to do?

158
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,700
A duet with and why?

159
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,300
I think we both can agree.

160
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,900
It will be Chris Stapleton.

161
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,400
Because Chris Stapleton is kind of like that guy.

162
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,100
That's helping bridge, the gap between country and blues, and soul rock and roll thing.

163
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,300
So when I, when I see him and somebody doing what he's doing, is almost a reflection of myself.

164
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
That's beautiful.

165
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
How about you Taylor?

166
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,100
Honestly, if I can do a duet with anybody, I wanted to do it with it.

167
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,700
Would either be Susan Tedeschi or Brandi.

168
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,300
Carlile.

169
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,900
Nice choices.

170
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,000
Wendy is asking.

171
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What was the biggest life learning from this experience with American Idol?

172
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,700
It's a good question.

173
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:24,300
Um, The basically where I took most from it was to start believing myself.

174
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,800
You guys don't know who I am.

175
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,900
I am a very known to be kind of timid and laid-back and shy and introverted.

176
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,500
But when I am on that stage, I am different and it's kind of thing.

177
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,300
I need to balance.

178
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,600
It's like I need to just learn to believe in myself in.

179
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,800
And that's where that show has.

180
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,000
Taught me is like up all hours of the night learning stuff and just pushing yourself to the limit.

181
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,200
So, Basically, I learned to keep going jover Duty.

182
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:09,500
So then I think all of us could take a little note, a tip from that as well as to believe in ourselves, you know, especially in such a time as this where there's uncertainty there's volatility and you know around the globe and you want.

183
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:17,000
One thing we can do is believe in ourselves and you know, be thankful for each day that we have and get after it.

184
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,600
So, I love that.

185
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:31,100
Christian is asking, what do you feel keeps upcoming musicians and songwriters for making it interesting question, what prevents them from making it?

186
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,700
Just I guess not being able to relate.

187
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,200
I mean if you don't have anybody that.

188
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:46,200
So the thing I learned singing gospel music and being in church is that you can have a really good singer sing a song.

189
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:59,600
But if they don't feel it, if people don't receive it that way, then it's not going to go over well basically, so if you're not writing something that's going to touch somebody, so make them cry or whatever that emotion that your time, projected ain't going to work.

190
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,600
It's good.

191
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,700
It's got to be authentic.

192
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,400
Yes.

193
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:14,300
That's why I think when you said pulling from a deep place and a an authentic experience like that, that shines through when you do that, when you tap into that.

194
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:23,700
All right, our last question here from semenko, how has your family loved ones and Friends, reacted to your newfound success.

195
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,800
Oh God, they love it.

196
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,700
But I am sure they over at this point.

197
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,800
I am sure the old a whole thing is like we can't.

198
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,300
I mean it's his home.

199
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:46,100
So I am very happy that people notice who I am but it can't get a little nerve-racking especially when they just try to enjoy our family time and somebody comes up and say something like this is what I signed up for.

200
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,800
So I think they love it.

201
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
They just like I broke.

202
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,400
Hmm.

203
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,600
And you have a little son.

204
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,800
Yes.

205
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,100
Name, how old is he?

206
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,400
Jayven will be Jamie.

207
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,900
Did Shane will be six years old.

208
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,200
He was born on my birthday.

209
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,300
Sal's my present.

210
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,600
Wow.

211
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,500
What a special kid.

212
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,000
Does he have?

213
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The same pipes?

214
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,800
Are you?

215
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,200
We don't know yet.

216
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,400
We're going to find out because you know, what are you doing in Rome?

217
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,500
I am not going to work with them.

218
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,800
We'd love to have the daddy son duet on one of our events.

219
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,500
One of these days.

220
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,500
All right.

221
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,600
Well, Everyone's waiting for this moment.

222
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,300
So Joven if you and Taylor could take it away.

223
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,200
It sounds like you guys have a few tunes that Taylor's going to be doing.

224
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,500
And then a few tunes that job and you're going to do.

225
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,000
So, we're super excited for this, take us away.

226
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:53,200
You made a killer point about, you know if you're not feeling it, it's not going to be real kind of whole thing about people resonate with something.

227
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,700
If it's, if it's something you lived in, you know, and you're singing from a Place.

228
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,200
And so this first song is called lion.

229
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,200
And it's about when you're being cheated on and, you know, it, but you can't prove it.

230
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,100
I have been there.

231
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:24,300
I got a feeling that something's wrong.

232
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,100
Once you're kissing me reeling.

233
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:36,000
But lately the magic song, I think there's a problem.

234
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:50,300
I can't seem to find that look in your eyes baby that I used to see all the it's cause you didn't.

235
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,700
I am here, she been lying.

236
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,800
Even lying next to my new Bridges to do.

237
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,000
Everything is alright, but I know something's wrong with you.

238
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Even lying next to somebody new and you're lying.

239
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:50,100
It don't take a genius, just see things to change between us and never will Hangzhou girl.

240
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,700
Something's missing love is not easy.

241
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:06,400
Hey, you gotta know where some levels, but somehow I feel like I am.

242
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:15,600
Yes, you have been lying even lying next to somebody.

243
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,000
And you're lying.

244
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:06,200
Somebody new and you lie to me.

245
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,700
So yeah, that's definitely a song.

246
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,600
I have lived through singing from that place.

247
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:43,100
Where you know something dirty is going on and you just can't prove it, but, you know, it in your gut, it's not a good place to be.

248
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,600
And this next one?

249
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,800
Is another one that I didn't live per se but I watched it.

250
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,000
I watched it being lived and it hurt deep to see it.

251
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,100
It's a song about my brother.

252
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:10,400
I got a little brother who's been in and out of addiction for a long time, heroin and different things and it resulted in him being homeless and I never know where he is most of the time.

253
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,700
And I wrote this song, kind of trying to put myself in his shoes.

254
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:23,100
And so what y'all think it's called water under the bridge?

255
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:38,800
I am through the smoke and I have drank my last bottle.

256
00:25:42,300 --> 00:26:07,000
I have spent 15 years old on this road because sometimes you choices and burn down your own, but that's what I have made my bed now, I will sleep in it when it rains it, pours.

257
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:18,300
It is what it is under and be it's a hard place to be.

258
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:32,000
Begging for change selling newspapers and who I am?

259
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,500
Sometimes the weather can't mess up.

260
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,600
You plant.

261
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:45,500
That's what made my baby sleep in.

262
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,100
Is world.

263
00:26:53,100 --> 00:27:03,800
It is the rain pouring down.

264
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:09,400
I try to drown out the sound under ayat.

265
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,800
I can't.

266
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:28,100
That's what water under the bridge time.

267
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,600
Made my bed.

268
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,200
Now, I will sleep in the when it rains.

269
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,400
It.

270
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,500
Pours.

271
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
It is what it is.

272
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,900
Under the wreath.

273
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,800
Now we're going to do one together.

274
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,100
Now.

275
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,500
It's another one.

276
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,100
I wrote in the kind of like my message to the world.

277
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
If I had just one thing to say to the world before I died.

278
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,500
This would be it and I think it's the vices and I love the way he does the other half of it.

279
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:30,100
And he just learned this like yesterday, like today last night, and he's, he did it.

280
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,800
He did a great job.

281
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,300
He nailed it.

282
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,600
So this one's called, just like you.

283
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,400
They all come into this world the same way.

284
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,400
We have all got Mama's to think when we were kids.

285
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,100
We'd play with anyone now, rage.

286
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:04,000
Didn't matter what Rings somewhere along the way.

287
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,400
We left things, people tell me more than people themselves.

288
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:17,500
If we don't turn off the news and find better things to do, life might be more like heaven.

289
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:49,100
If you say, we're all gonna die.

290
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:16,900
I have learned from the time cuz he — in the dark never way you do.

291
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:43,500
If you love me.

292
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,500
Yeah.

293
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,500
Jeremy.

294
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:30,300
I mentioned my love for Chris Stapleton, so this next song is about him.

295
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,400
Kick it off.

296
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Say my share of broken a Lowe's told you we that used they were gone wherever they go f****** hate it.

297
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,800
And just come down from the heavens.

298
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:22,300
Just to help her come to teachers and it helps a mother.

299
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,100
See myself walking a lows.

300
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,500
So, did we?

301
00:32:39,300 --> 00:33:08,000
If I go wherever they go looking Halos, that you don't go looking.

302
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:25,700
And for the reasons, why don't you lay eggs in diesel and I miss, you know, the answer they belong.

303
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,900
The Whitney.

304
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:01,700
Rockin a knows that he's working.

305
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:18,900
Late knows that he used to A little homage to the late great, Stevie Ray Vaughan, but I feel it.

306
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,600
If I could just talk about the soul and a route to this song is definitely a southern born and raised.

307
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,300
So let us keep some of that from the barbecue sauce.

308
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,800
I love and giving sight to the blind.

309
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,100
My baby love and causes Sunshine.

310
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:18,100
She's my pride and joy, she must be little baby.

311
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,600
I am her little lover boy.

312
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,800
Let us meet the man.

313
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,300
She's my pride and joy.

314
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,700
Dig Me Up.

315
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,100
My sweet little thing.

316
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,400
Yeah.

317
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:42,800
Yes.

318
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,100
He is.

319
00:36:43,100 --> 00:37:07,200
My pottinger is my pride and joy.

320
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,900
Little baby.

321
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,000
I am her little lover boy.

322
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,100
So we got one more tune.

323
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,100
Of course, you know, they're doing all covers.

324
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,700
This is Into the Mystic.

325
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,900
I guess what, I get from this song is just talking about it.

326
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,500
We won't buy one for the win.

327
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,900
Awesome.

328
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,600
So, younger than this house?

329
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:18,300
With everybody bows, one sitting into the mystery of my here.

330
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:32,900
The city's smell the season at Isola spherify, still into the mystery.

331
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:45,500
And that far gone, blows coming home?

332
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:59,300
That's all I have to feeling now.

333
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,400
I could even win in the days of old.

334
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,100
There are souls.

335

When she's gone.

It's not warm when she's away.

344
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,700
And no sunshine when she's gone.

345

When she's gone, and she's always gone too long.

351
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,400
One in this time when she's gone.

Wondering if she's gone to stay, ain't no sunshine when she's gone.

00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,000

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.

And this house just ain't no home.
