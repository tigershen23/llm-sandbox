1
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,400
Still, enough time to figure out how to Chase my Blues Away.

2
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,500
Somebody who loves me.

3
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,600
Hello, everyone.

4
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:50,100
Welcome to our interview Spotlight today with Julia Hartwig VP of marketing at cap.

5
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,600
Chase and we are super excited to be able to have her here.

6
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:03,300
As she is going to crack the code for us on these myths around marketing attribution and metrics.

7
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,900
I mean, there's a lot of things that you see on LinkedIn and different influencers.

8
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,800
In out different things we were just talking about this in the green room and majority of it is probably pretty fluffy.

9
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,300
So I am excited to bring up Julia, join me here on stage.

10
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,400
Alright.

11
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,100
Hello.

12
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,400
Hi.

13
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,900
How's it going?

14
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,700
How are you?

15
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,200
Good.

16
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,300
I am so excited to be here.

17
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,900
Thank you for having me.

18
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,200
Oh, I am excited because you have got a lot to say about marketing metrics.

19
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:46,300
Attributions, you're probably one of the savviest markers, experienced marketers, and, and you can go really deep.

20
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:54,200
I have found with attribution metrics, and so before we jump in the key, tell us a little bit just about you and cap.

21
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,800
Chase.

22
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,300
Yeah, so I am Julia.

23
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,000
I am the VP of marketing at cap.

24
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,200
Chase I live in New York and Brooklyn which is almost Manhattan.

25
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:14,600
She's getting some really I spent my time prior to being intact really traveling the world and spending a lot of time living in a lot of countries.

26
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:33,600
I lived in Madrid Vancouver, even Las Vegas at one point and that's primarily because my husband was a professional poker player before he pivoted into Tech and I Yeah, I am I live I ran a link Farm originally, I was like deep and a CR at one point in my career, a link Farm.

27
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:45,900
I had a disgusting link Farm, but one point you could hack anything, it was like, Hey, like, we want to rank and it was like, scrape, your content blink, an s*** out of it and have the right domain name and remain power.

28
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,000
It's hard to imagine this.

29
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:56,500
Now, I feel like saying this makes me sound really old, but I was like, if you wanted to appear for, let us say Vancouver, if you bought the keyword, like travel Hoover or the domain.

30
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,700
Sorry Travel Vancouver or like go Vancouver you would be number one.

31
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:17,000
Like it was just that easy obviously with like all that shifted but I think that taught me a thing or two about like not looking at everything as if there's like some Trend that's going to solve your problems and probably why I go so deep on everything because like I did do that and it was cool while it lasted.

32
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,900
I made some money off it but That doesn't mean it's sad when it dies, let me tell you.

33
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:31,500
So a little bit about cap Chase and, you know, I am probably the most excited about this company at any company, I have been at purely off of the traction.

34
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,300
They have had in two years and how different and disruptive they really are in the industry.

35
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:45,300
And so when I started looking for my next job and like where I wanted to land, it was really important to me that they were a B2B company for supervisors.

36
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,800
I don't do b2c marketing, I don't even want to talk about it.

37
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,600
I don't get it.

38
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:55,200
I just told a girl my team that's social is the thing that like I just don't understand and like great job, and she was like, okay?

39
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,100
And then I really researched a lot and I have been at a lot of startups.

40
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,800
I have been at SAS companies, I have done the, you know, I lived in San Francisco.

41
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,800
I did the Silicon Valley, like quintessential thing.

42
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:15,400
And what I have seen is I could there're big raises, followed, big layoffs, followed by, you know, success or non-success.

43
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:25,600
And a lot of times the internals of the company don't actually match the Any of what the valuations say or like, raising is also telling a story.

44
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:33,200
And, so I was looking for someone who was doing something really different, that was kind of taking away from that, could provide value to people without giving up equity.

45
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,900
And I kind of came across cap, Chase organically, and actually applied for the job, without a recruiter, which kind of rare in my position, I think.

46
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:49,000
Anyway, so if you haven't heard of capture a Serafin tech company that helps a Saunders get money and essentially how they do.

47
00:08:49,100 --> 00:09:02,200
That are they look at your recurring Revenue, we have really Advanced Integrations with pretty much every major way that you would record Banking, and then they're able to assess and unlock funds almost instantly.

48
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,000
And so unlike in a traditional baked word takes months, we can do it in.

49
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,300
I mean, depends on the client but like two three days.

50
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,200
I am and like Max a week so really fast.

51
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,600
And it was incredibly important for me to be at a company that I felt had product Market fit.

52
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,100
You know, a lot of people say they have it.

53
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:30,500
That's I can talk about this but like the number one myth is like if you don't have a product you can't really Market anything everything dies.

54
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,200
So I was really excited, they have raised over 900 million dollars and worked with over 3,000.

55
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,100
Where's at this point, and they're only two years old, and they're in your lap Mark already.

56
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,200
So really exciting company, really disrupting a really fun place to be.

57
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,900
And yeah, that was kind of what I was looking for.

58
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,500
But anyway, let us jump into Market ngratulations marketing.

59
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,000
Know, it's really cool.

60
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,100
It's a very cool company.

61
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:02,200
I am thrilled to be part of the team and to have been, you know, to have gotten through their interview process and be where I am.

62
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,500
I have learned so much already, and I am really excited about it.

63
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,000
That's awesome.

64
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:16,000
Well, we're so excited to unpack some of these myths and attribution metric myths.

65
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:27,600
So before we jump into that, though we do have a pole, let us pull up the pole and see how many marketing attribution software tools.

66
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,600
Are you currently using at your company?

67
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,800
So, feel free to place your votes in there.

68
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,900
I have got up to 10 options here.

69
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,800
I mean, I feel like people use a lot.

70
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,600
I am always getting out of yeah, 426, I am always getting sent them.

71
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
My people in the company are like, hey, we need to buy this.

72
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
I am like, do we?

73
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,300
This is going to be a big topic that you're going to help us unpack.

74
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,300
All right, well, that's good to know it.

75
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,800
So most.

76
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,600
Whoa, here we go.

77
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,100
Okay, four to six.

78
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,400
Is the common doesn't surprise me schools.

79
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,500
All right.

80
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay.

81
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:34,200
Well that gives us a good sense of how many folks are using tools and I guess the question really is like relying on as we're jumping into this topic here you know, you think about B2B marketing there, it's a complex buying process and even harder going into 2023 with layoffs less resources.

82
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:46,400
You gotta Sokak LTV profitability across everything, everyone's tighter more than ever, the board of directors investors everybody is like on you more than ever.

83
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:58,000
And so this is where Julia like you are the expert here with all the experience you had and I love the transparency, you had transparency.

84
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,200
You had with me when we spoke earlier of just like the numbers of failures that have helped.

85
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,000
You get to this point of Learning.

86
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:14,300
And so, I mean, I would love to just hear your thoughts of just like going in and 2023.

87
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:22,800
What are you saying with some of the big shifts and changes and with marketing attribution and metrics?

88
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,900
You know, is there anything that you're seeing in particular that's really changing or different?

89
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:41,200
Yeah, I mean, I think a lot has shifted in marketing first of all like I think like the era of doing nothing, I am not doing nothing like the pray and spray, it's like coming to an ear and you just can't afford to do it, right?

90
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:51,600
Like it's just too expensive and so that kind of like has brought I would say the emergence of line of thinking that you see everywhere, you know.

91
00:12:51,600 --> 00:13:00,100
Like I think B2B it goes through like four years, like originally was the demand generation experts like, that was like Thing you needed to do.

92
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,600
You need to do DG and like that solves your problems and then it was like, you need to do a BM that solves your problems.

93
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,100
And now I kind of think we're moving into like this like oh it's a I was like AI is going to solve all your problems.

94
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:21,400
Like we're going to run an i and like AI has gotten really good on some things and like I still, you know, I am using tools like I don't use chat GTA, but I use Jasper, which is a competitor of theirs.

95
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:27,000
And I had to write a lot of stuff and I think that it's an amazing.

96
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,100
What you can do with II and attack.

97
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:46,000
And but I also think that if you are unable to understand what you're trying to get out of something, if you are unable to connect, you know, everything to the core and the foundation's like, it doesn't really matter because I chat GPT can't tell you what it's going to say.

98
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,200
Like you still have to tell it what you want it to say.

99
00:13:48,200 --> 00:14:09,900
It just writes the content without you having to go through like the first iteration of you know I don't even know what you want to say like the first iteration of R draft or you have like think through how you're going to intro like it kind of does that work for you but like you still need to know the story or telling you still need to know that the data points and like your narrative around it or it's that's right.

100
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,500
It's generic fluff.

101
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:28,400
So yeah and I think like one of the things I have seen is like when I came in to be like I started in growth, and I was running a free product and I think like also by the way, like Worlds, Collide in Silicon Valley, like that company is very much come back into my life, like in a million ways.

102
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:35,900
And I was like, really But anyways, that product I worked on a free product building, a free product.

103
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,700
And like, just like all tech companies, I kind of like threw a sketch.

104
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Violet me, that was like pre figma, and they were like, hey here you build it?

105
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
I was like, I don't, I don't.

106
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,200
Yeah.

107
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,500
And I like deleted stuff.

108
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,000
I was like, all right, here's your free product and that was like the era of the growth marketer.

109
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,900
And I was like, all right, we're going to make a free product and it's to drive referrals, and we're going to be viral, and we're going to be just like Dropbox and like that's the goal and I think we did do a lot of that.

110
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,600
At and it did become the demand generation machine for the company, and I am really proud of that.

111
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:24,500
But what I saw in like what has enlightened, I think the way I approach marketing forever, as first of all, I had a really hard CEO in that he was like a very, not hard as a person, but he was a very He needed like in a good way like I think he pushed people that I probably wouldn't have pushed myself.

112
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:32,000
And, so I was forced to make models and do things that was like, way outside of my comfort zone is like an early entry was basically growth marketer.

113
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,600
I was just like, what, what do you mean a growth model?

114
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
What the hell is that?

115
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:49,800
And I did all that with his help and that really paves the way for me, I think in my career, and he also really he gave us again like these errors are gone but now you have run Cards and a different credit card system.

116
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,000
But back then there were like these Embers cards and was like almost like a gift card.

117
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,400
And every day, I would have to be like, hey we're out of her LinkedIn.

118
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,200
Budget, can I like have some money please?

119
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,100
And I am both cars.

120
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:10,300
Will get like shut down and so, you know, my mentality walking into tooling and anything is like, will the first place of financial department is going to go or CEOs going to go with the marketing team.

121
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,700
Like they don't attack Engineers on their toolset, they don't attack product teams on all the tools, they're using.

122
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,200
But they're going to come after the marketing.

123
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:17,400
Team.

124
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,600
They really don't even go up to the sales team, they're going to come after the marketing team and be like, hey the f*** are you spending money on?

125
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,500
And so, I am very Roi focus and I think like the new world is like Revenue.

126
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,800
I have heard that I have seen this all over the internet but like, I really believe in Revenue based marketing.

127
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,400
And to me, that's like you just drive all the way through the funnel.

128
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Like, you're not really just a lead generation machine.

129
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:46,500
You're focused on like finding the right people doing it, efficiently and yeah, that's kind of like my Spiel and B2B but beauty is hard.

130
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:58,300
I wasn't into Like it's a Playbook but it's not a Playbook and I called a bread or earlier Revenue based marketing.

131
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,600
Can you like give us a little definition of that?

132
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,599
I mean, I kind of made it up but I see it everywhere.

133
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:12,599
So I am sure there's like a real definition and like one of the things that drives me nuts is when people use a word that's like actually has a meaning and like you make up your own meaning to it.

134
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,700
So like I might be doing that right now so just like all good.

135
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,099
Eric what's your showed you?

136
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:25,300
Yeah, to me, Revenue base marketing is basically if you look and I think this is what's so interesting is you see this everywhere.

137
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:41,300
It's like the type of algorithm you see, on LinkedIn words like go all the way to revenue and your Roi should be 3x, whatever your cost is and like all of these like really crazy budgetary, like, considerations for how you should do your CAC and all of that sort of stuff.

138
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,100
But I don't think about it.

139
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,500
Like that.

140
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,200
I would say, like, when I think of Revenue based marketing, it's like, literally my team.

141
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,200
When we look at our dashboard, Words, we don't actually look at cost and mql.

142
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,900
We look all the way across to revenue.

143
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,100
It's in the dash.

144
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:59,700
It's how I guide my agency, and I am not telling them drive me mql like I don't actually care.

145
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:11,000
I barely look at that number and like I am sure everyone is appalled by that but I look at you know what you would consider like a qualified sales qualified lead is usually where I stop.

146
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:26,400
I mean I will look all the way through but obviously B2B sales Cycles tend to be a little longer so you need like a more don't feedback loop and so like I am judging on Revenue at that point in then I use like the prehistoric like conversion rates from sales to figure out exactly what a reasonable rate for that is.

147
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:39,700
And then I Hold Steady on that and that can mean a lot of things, it means if that goes up at a point where I am uncomfortable, I am going to cut spend, like I am not going to keep spending which is I think very different from what most people do at least from what I have seen.

148
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,400
Most people just keep spending and I like it will come back down but it's a math problem, right?

149
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,100
Like if your denominator just keeps going up, like you're f*****.

150
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,100
I cut spend it.

151
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,000
I make them every one re-optimize within the campaign's you have.

152
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:04,800
And that means that like you can grow really efficiently at that point because I very optimized and you're not like bloated with a lot of add keywords, or whatever if you're doing vlad's or whatever particular tool you're in.

153
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,500
And so I think about that with everything though.

154
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:17,000
So I look at you know I ran an outbound team and an inbound team and to me like all that mattered was your Roi on each of those humans because basically there are tool, right?

155
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,200
Like You're paying for them.

156
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,900
And, so I think about all marketing channels, like that organic same thing.

157
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,300
Like, how much does it cost to create content?

158
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, okay, there's like your costume to organic and I break it out like that and then I try very hard to like focus on the.

159
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,400
I mean, it sounds so obvious.

160
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:44,700
Everyone says this, but like I literally do this like just focus on the one thing that's working and to try to add their instead of like trying to do everything at once and that means slower growth in a lot of ways.

161
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:52,700
But like I do think right now in the current environment You're not going to triple like you're going to double, like it's going to be really hard.

162
00:19:52,700 --> 00:20:03,500
And I think with boards breathing down people's necks like you don't want to be spending making those assumptions until you're really secure with that level of spend.

163
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,900
Because at the end of the day it's my job on the line, right?

164
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,000
Like whom are they going to yell at?

165
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,400
It's me, right?

166
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,300
Right?

167
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
What are they trying to be really conservative?

168
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,100
What are the current channels going into 2023 that you guys are focused on?

169
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,700
On and then doubling down on.

170
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:30,300
I mean, people would probably, like, judge me, this is another thing like, you know, we're talking about the myths and attribution and modeling like the belief that there is somehow some magic be to be like sauce.

171
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,200
And Instagram is kind of lost on me.

172
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Like, I just, I don't think that Facebook is going to.

173
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,800
I know you can do really good look-alikes, and you can do all sorts of things.

174
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:54,100
But like unless you're targeting a person who is on Instagram all day, like I guess more tech people, like, I am on Instagram a lot but like I am going after Different Persona and like, I don't think they're sitting there all day, and so I don't think it's an efficient use of capital.

175
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,100
I still think Google will reign supreme.

176
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,000
I think that it's the best, like, it's the highest intent traffic.

177
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,500
You can pull in, and I think you can inform a lot off of what Google keywords are performing.

178
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,900
Like you can build SEO programs, you can build a million things.

179
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,200
And I think that LinkedIn, you know, for a B2B for not everyone, you know, I have done this for different personas, like it doesn't always work but If LinkedIn is performing for you, it's very expensive, but it tends.

180
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,600
It has some really good targeting.

181
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:29,400
And in some ways I think LinkedIn, you know, I have an agency now that runs this, but they said this to me and I thought this was like, I trust them.

182
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:47,000
That the LinkedIn is almost at a point where you can do true, ABM on it like you don't really need to buy an additional software to do that and that's what I mean about like be careful about your marriage sex doc you know the era of like just by everything by an intent based software right before you get into that.

183
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,900
Let us jump into myth number one.

184
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,500
Let us go to the first one.

185
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,900
What is your first myth?

186
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,800
You need more Tech tools.

187
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,600
I don't think so.

188
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,100
I mean, I guess you didn't pack them.

189
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,100
You need some more Tech tools.

190
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,700
Do you need something to send emails?

191
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,200
That's a good system.

192
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,400
That campaign stamps.

193
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,100
Yes.

194
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,400
So you need like Marketo or HubSpot.

195
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,600
Thank you.

196
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,400
Not going to live without that marketing automation is core.

197
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,500
You need to do lead scoring.

198
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Do you need much else?

199
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,800
I don't know, maybe segment.

200
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,700
Even if your product team isn't running out, like that's something you need.

201
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:33,100
You need to see a mess, otherwise you're slow and clunky and by the way, talk about Lessons Learned, you know, I am notorious, I will never forget this.

202
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:39,000
I have told to companies that if you didn't code your own f****** website, you are in a tech company, not true.

203
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,200
Oops.

204
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:51,100
But the that you need to CMS and I think that's really the core of what you need to do your job.

205
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,600
Job.

206
00:22:51,600 --> 00:23:01,100
And then you need to be able to take that data at from segments and you need an analyst who can build you some sort of bi tool which the company probably needs anyway.

207
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:17,700
So it's not really a marketing purchase but I think with those things you can do just about anything you need some data tools, if you're going to pull list and things like that and you need, you know, the B2B toolset of like some sort of CMS but I see it's ERM sorry.

208
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:39,800
But other than that, like Think you can do a lot and, you know if you're starting out like I think it depends on the era of the company to like, I have gotten some tools, I love an example of show pad, that was really expensive and spent a lot of money on it, but it depends on the needs of the business and I think that made sense for us.

209
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,700
But like I am not I can't buy show ped today at the company.

210
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,300
I am at they don't need and it's expensive.

211
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:54,400
So that's not a marketing attribution tool, but I think just that's one thing I think just if you look at even the Our Tech stack is like you need visible and you need this thing and you need that thing.

212
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:06,300
And you know, you know, some sort of Demands software, you need something to send gifts, you need like Lord, only knows like there's just a million tools and I don't think you do.

213
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,700
And I actually think like, if your foundations aren't, if your house isn't built, right?

214
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:15,100
Like the more you add the worse, it gets because that's why your attribution is f*****.

215
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,500
Like just bottom-line.

216
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:24,200
Like you cannot, you cannot look it attribution and think like, oh, hey like Our inputs equals better like that's not actually true.

217
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:31,500
If you can't understand the simple stuff, like adding more to it just makes it like data soup and soup, you end up.

218
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,800
It is Data soup.

219
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,100
And then it's like the UTM.

220
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,800
Have you ever seen?

221
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,600
Like the, I have done this so many times.

222
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:56,100
Now that like, it almost, it's almost comical to me, like, I have yet to join a company that could do utm's properly like the UTM Mass is like, I don't know what that is, but like I think I actually think I do know I think like there is a human aspect to all of this, you cannot take the human out of it and like, you know, you don't want a doctor who's been on for 20 hours a week.

223
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,100
You don't really want a marketer being responsible for adding tagging codes like that.

224
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,900
Do you want to pull a?

225
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,600
You want to automate as much of that as possible and remove that?

226
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:13,800
And so, with more Tech tools, you're getting into, like, we need to do multi-touch attribution, and we need to do all these things because we touch them so many times, and we need to like the world is so complicated and often.

227
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:25,900
If you believe that You just swim in your data and I have talked to many CEOs and I have talked to many people where they're unable to tie their conversions to like a source really tie the conversions to a source.

228
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:34,600
So it's like, oh well like you teams are being stripped on the, like, Google oauth page, or like, we don't really know where all these people came from, but like, they're converting.

229
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,200
So like how do we decode that?

230
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,700
And I am like, well, I just don't trust my marketing team.

231
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:55,500
I hear that a lot, and I am like, well, If that's the case, like, why are you letting them by more s*** like stop buying s*** like and start over a little bit, like, revisit the core of, like, what, you know, how these things are built.

232
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,200
And I think, like, if you can build and I almost, it's I it's funny.

233
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,300
I hope none of the people that have worked for me.

234
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,700
You're going to hear this, but I hated marketing Ops.

235
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
I have inherited it a lot.

236
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,400
It's like very complicated and important actually.

237
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,400
And they I actually think like don't buy tools like get your marketing Ops in order, like Get the Lead scoring working.

238
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:23,400
Spend the time, making sure your status is makes sense, that you can pull the reports you need.

239
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:35,800
And I think, like, often, you know what, you see on LinkedIn is like, you need to do like 50 touch attribution and you need to this tool changed my life.

240
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:44,800
And I don't think that anybody talk about, it is really doing it because if you're really doing it, then you wouldn't need to talk about it.

241
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,400
Like companies this masked ball might drop and I mean, it's kind of true, isn't it?

242
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,100
Like they're looking Its social media.

243
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:09,500
Like it's like the era of YouTube is kind of ending to write and like, how many people bought makeup because they were told to buy it by someone who is paid by a makeup company to do it, you know, like I don't, I don't think that you can that wasn't true reviews.

244
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:16,800
Like mmm, that was marketing and like I think as a marketer you guys people should be a little more Savvy.

245
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,500
Like, you know, you read about how Uber did it or how this company did it.

246
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,400
But if you actually talk to people work at these companies and I do try To do that a lot.

247
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,900
They're just like, oh yeah, it was really messy.

248
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:33,000
It was bad like, okay, makes I think that like, Yeah, The Illusion that someone has it together.

249
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:46,200
I don't know, I think it's always a challenge and if you're dependent on tools, you're actually in a worse position than if you're at least dependent on yourself with the economy being where it is.

250
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,400
Like, you don't want to be hyper dependent on a tool set.

251
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,400
It also means like you're managing tools, right?

252
00:27:53,400 --> 00:28:01,500
Like, that's, that's a lot of work versus Andre, I think with, you know, the actual working on doing marketing, like I bought drift.

253
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,200
I will tell you, I tell everyone that I bought, I was really early to drift.

254
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
They came to our Office.

255
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,800
They like built.

256
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:11,900
It was so early that I remember the amazing guy who like literally like, wrote all the coffee for me and like installed it on our website.

257
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,100
I am sure they don't do that anymore.

258
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,000
And I was so excited.

259
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,300
I literally did the math put them?

260
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,500
I was like, we get this many visitors a month at this conversion rate.

261
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,900
You're going to give me a 2% uptick.

262
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,600
That means that I am going to have this much money more and on my lead funnel every month.

263
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,100
And they were like, yo, it's like magic.

264
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,300
And you know what?

265
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,600
It actually turned into.

266
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
It was a nightmare.

267
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,800
I didn't know how to turn it off.

268
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,200
Off.

269
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,700
It was always on the SDR team disappeared to Burning Man.

270
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,500
And I spent the whole week trying to figure out how to turn drift off because no one could man.

271
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
It did nothing.

272
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,300
And like, I was like, oh lesson learned.

273
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,300
Like if your you made me believe I needed this.

274
00:28:52,300 --> 00:29:00,500
And you did some really good marketing, but like I don't think this does much like I summons, highly motivated to buy your product, do they really need to chat pop up to make them buy it?

275
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,600
Like probably not support.

276
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,800
That makes a lot more sense.

277
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,100
But I don't know about for marketing, like, and like to make matters even more interesting like we had intercom.

278
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,800
And I bought drift on top of that.

279
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,900
Wow, cool.

280
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,300
You had real-life experience lesson learned right there.

281
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,400
Yeah.

282
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,600
I mean, and but that's not an attribution tool but it's the same thing and that adds complexity, right?

283
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:39,300
Because now you're like, if you're looking at attribution and you're looking at the world of where things are coming from, you, suddenly have another chance Well, that isn't capturing your utm's like suddenly they're in a chair pot you're like f***.

284
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,900
Where the hell did these people come from?

285
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,700
I don't know and I think like you really want to streamline that and you want to make it easy for the buyer.

286
00:29:47,700 --> 00:30:00,800
Like you know what do I think is like the most important thing actually for a B2B marketer to buy, it's a calendar booking tool for the most part nobody wants to like when would want to take a break, which one's your favorite?

287
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,900
No, I am going to give props to Chile Piper but I will say that it has its problems.

288
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,800
Mm, I like chili Piper.

289
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,200
I think on a big sales team.

290
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:16,400
They do like really smart routing and but do I think for most teams you could probably get away with like the built-in HubSpot one?

291
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:16,800
Yeah.

292
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:24,700
Or you know whatever, I don't think you need an, if you don't have a big sales team you don't need to worry about routing in the way that you do with.

293
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:32,500
You know many people It's just not an issue you're dealing with so that's the other thing.

294
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,000
I think that's like a thing.

295
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,500
I would say Tech has cool.

296
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:45,600
The martic is really cool but like some of those only are opportunities at scale and so like if you have a one-person marketing team and a one-person sales team, like do you really need this?

297
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,800
It's good.

298
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
No, that's good.

299
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,300
All right.

300
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
Well, let us go in and myth.

301
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:55,500
Number 20, can't chat GPT run.

302
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
My marketing team question mark.

303
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
No question.

304
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
I don't think so.

305
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:17,100
I know and if you look at like I can't, I mean I got a slack from somebody that said like, hey here's some marketing strategy AI tool, and I was like, And they were like, well, would you use this?

306
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,000
And I was like, no, I write my own strategy.

307
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:29,300
Like, I, isn't that what you pay me for like no, I wouldn't use that but like you can't AI your way out of a problem yet.

308
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,800
Like the AI, isn't there?

309
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:45,300
You know, like a I was really good at doing like a really a, to be line thing like with living within a box and I think that you need to understand more than anything what you're putting into something if you're going.

310
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,900
Anything else out of it?

311
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,300
Like I said I use Jasper.

312
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,900
But like if you can't tell Jasper.

313
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,700
Hey Jasper.

314
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,800
I need you to write me exactly this post with this as a message line and this is like the kicker and the audience and everything I want.

315
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:07,200
Like it's really just doing the writing, it's not doing the ideas, and so I don't know like I am really ants I think.

316
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,700
Yeah.

317
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:16,100
By the idea that there's like if there's a I run, it's somehow like a good tool and I see so many of them, you know, we get sent all the time.

318
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:21,200
It's like we're going to do AI routing, and we go to do it everything lead scoring.

319
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,500
We're going to do AI this, and we have machine learning on this and a proprietary algorithm.

320
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,400
I have heard that term a lot its patented.

321
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:37,700
I am like okay I worked in an IP patent for him is like one of my first jobs and I can tell you right now, you can get a patent for anything as long as like the words don't exist in the world.

322
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:42,800
That doesn't mean it's like groundbreaking Tech and so, I don't know.

323
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,000
Like, I think that's just a, it's a sad state for marketing that.

324
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,400
Like, that's what we're marketers are selling to the world, which means, like as a marketer, you're going to come in, and they're going to be like, well, why do I need you?

325
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Like I run on LinkedIn that you could, you don't.

326
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,400
I mean, I just got a flag, I read on LinkedIn.

327
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,800
You don't need an outbound team anymore.

328
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,900
The marketing team should just send sequences and that's more efficient.

329
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,200
I was like Okay.

330
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,700
I mean I sure but also like at what cost, what's the conversion rate versus a personalized?

331
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,200
Email?

332
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:23,000
If you were able to give a targeted list to a bdr team or an SDR team and personalize all those emails from the get go and do multi-touch, do you get more bang for your buck?

333
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,100
Like that's you should test that.

334
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,900
Like, I don't know the answer, but I think that those are the questions that people aren't asking.

335
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,500
They're just like, oh, I read it on LinkedIn and I can give you like crazy.

336
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,100
I mean, I ran a scr team and like the LinkedIn Str world is quite Big.

337
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,000
And I feel like marketing is kind of like that too.

338
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,900
And, you know, yeah, 20 there was like this, this thing like you should send a break up email.

339
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,400
No, you shouldn't send a breakup email like if they have a responded to you and you're just like I feel like I am not getting the message.

340
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,100
Yeah you're not getting the message, they're not going to respond to that email.

341
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,200
Like that's its a numbers game.

342
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,900
It's not a lake or.

343
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,200
And they also said like oh if you put in typos people will think it's a human.

344
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,699
No.

345
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,600
It turns out.

346
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Google will just Spam block you.

347
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,300
So like just don't do that.

348
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:18,699
Like it's simple and you know like that's the examples of like people read.

349
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,400
Finally.

350
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,800
Also, once it's working for him, it's already not working by the time, he posts about that.

351
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,199
So you probably shouldn't listen to No One's Gonna Give You their, like, Masters stop.

352
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,699
Like I just wouldn't, that's just not how it works.

353
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:33,900
But anyway.

354
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,600
Yeah, I mean, my husband is, it's funny.

355
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:45,100
My husband is big in crypto, and he often talks about like, oh, I am gonna get this AI to do my marketing strategy, and I am like good luck with that.

356
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:51,400
You let me know how that pans out, and he's like, he's like I tried it and it was Isn't very good.

357
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,800
No, yeah.

358
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,000
So basically you're seeing anything pretty much.

359
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,400
It needs to be led driven strategically by humans and yeah, and I think the same thing with nortec.

360
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,900
Like, if you don't know why you're buying a tool, you're never going to get value out of it like, you know, be strategic.

361
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,300
I think I can't buy 70 tools and like I think that's something that's like a big difference in.

362
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,300
Like it took me years to get here, right?

363
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,700
Like it's not like I did that.

364
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,600
I did the same s***.

365
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,400
Like I just need everything to My life better.

366
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,200
Like I am going to be the best of my job.

367
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,600
If I buy drift, I am going to be the best of my job if I said do.

368
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,900
So I am going to be the best of my job if I buy whatever.

369
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:41,700
But like if you start to look at it long term and you actually see the budgets and the way that this is done at the top and the way people are reporting to boards and the way that through actually accountable to this marketing is accountable, for cost of acquisition, usually across marketing.

370
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,400
So that includes software, spend what that means is.

371
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,700
If you have a big software spend, you can't spend as much money on ads.

372
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,800
You can't do the fun stuff.

373
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,500
You can't run branded campaigns you.

374
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,800
Can't do Billboards, you can't do cool stuff.

375
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:00,100
You know, there's something to be said for out-of-home media and like that is expensive.

376
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,800
And it's not a play for Legion, but it's you can't do that.

377
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,800
If you spend all your money on Mark Tech like and why I would rather do that.

378
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,000
So well anyway, Julie you have such Rich experience.

379
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,400
I just want to hear one of your experiences coming into a marketing team.

380
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:28,000
For the first time you're the head of the marketing and what's the first thing you do?

381
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,600
Yeah, I do the same thing everywhere.

382
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:40,700
So I think I am hired for like, you know, I say I am a revenue base marketer if they're looking for like a brand person, or they're looking for a product marketer, they're probably not going to hire me.

383
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,300
So usually when I come in there's a reason and it's like DG is the problem.

384
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,500
And so, first thing I do is I assess the agency and I run.

385
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
My own attribution model.

386
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,500
I tell everyone and I have this is the thing about attribution.

387
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,000
That kills me.

388
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,300
I think it's there is no, there is no perfect world.

389
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:13,200
There is no perfect attribution and you need to just be consistent across the board, like just pick something and go with it and like if you don't have 16 analysts and you're not You don't know everything.

390
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:28,400
The best way to go is first touch because I mean that specifically because you want to give as much especially when you're looking at budgets you want to power up your paid advertisements as much as possible because often a most of the conversions are going to happen whether they heard about you organically first or not.

391
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:38,300
You want to make sure that you're capturing as much of your paid advertisement into conversion as possible in an early stage company, or mid-stage, even, or even sometimes later stage.

392
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,200
And I think that, like, that's the first thing I do is Like we're running first hunch, I wanted across-the-board.

393
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,300
I go to a data team if they have it, if not, I am like scampering around trying to find it.

394
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,900
I say I want a model built this way.

395
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,300
I want my cost per conversion on each point I had like an actual spreadsheet.

396
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,900
I give them and then I tell them like I need the state at like ASAP.

397
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:04,000
And I am going to build a model to at least goal where we should be on all of these to hit our goals as a company.

398
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,300
And that's, I begin there every time.

399
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:18,000
So it's usually the agency or the in-house paid crew is like getting a big Dragon eye on them or whatever you call it, like a dagger where I come in and a bull's-eye, and I am like, what are you doing?

400
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,900
And I think the easiest way to solve that problem is often just to throw out the agency and start over with a new one.

401
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:48,800
And just like and if painful like those people aren't bad people, you know, like I have had to let go of people who were great but like I need a clean slate to start over and That you can't often do with an in-house or with the people who have done it the way, they have done it because they were unwilling to kind of like revisit.

402
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,900
And the second thing I do is I make sure if they have segment running, I usually don't join a company that doesn't have segmented.

403
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,300
I do like some research on that beforehand just because it makes my life so much better.

404
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:09,100
I use segment, I take as much of the I am working on this, you know, in currently and I will probably always be working on this, but I am taking as much of the data as possible out of our marketing attribution.

405
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,100
Our marketing, it's not attribution you.

406
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,500
Use that word and I will suppose my head, I am marketing, what they called automation?

407
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:27,500
I take as much of that out of reporting out of Marketing automation as possible and get a dash boarded on a bi tool like Tableau or look or something like that, if possible.

408
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,200
So you can use the segment data and then use first touch their.

409
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,000
I think that's cleaner.

410
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,500
It's a place to start.

411
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,200
I mean, I would love to be in a world where we were running, you know, a w attribution.

412
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:47,700
It will but for now like at least I have a number to go off of and then I can go back and say like, all right, you're costing me this much per lead.

413
00:39:47,800 --> 00:40:12,800
This much per sales qualified lead, this punch for close lost or close one and then I can Baseline and I can improve and I can then look at like the niche within each area and say like all right your landing page conversion is horrific let us like fix that or you know the leads are bad like it's The sales team is complaining their bad.

414
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:25,100
I don't fight that fight at the sales, team tells me, they don't like believes, I am just like yeah okay they're probably got and I start there and like ice cream done the due diligence to actually see the data.

415
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,300
Exactly and it's easy.

416
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:41,100
If they are like if you look and it's like wow we're spending two hundred thousand dollars on every close one we have and the sales team is like I just work, s*** leads all day and 90% of their revenue is or there are Advertising is a Facebook you're like huh?

417
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:53,800
Yeah, okay, well let us turn that off and then you can take that money and like, you know, you can steal from Peter to pay Paul but you don't, you can hire people.

418
00:40:54,100 --> 00:41:02,600
People are really helpful, you can invest in, you know, I think the, this is why I like a, I can't do your marketing without great content.

419
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,500
Like your kind of f***** anyway, because what are they going to do?

420
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,100
They hit your website.

421
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,800
They don't know what you do.

422
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,500
They hate your website.

423
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,100
You have no social.

424
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:18,800
Proof, you know, you want like to build that resource center and so you can hire content writers, you can, there's a lot of stuff you can do with the money.

425
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,500
That's being spent on more Tech in my opinion and like I came into one company.

426
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,100
I save them almost a million dollars.

427
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,100
Whoo.

428
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,500
In March Tech buys and you know, events and you name it.

429
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,300
And events are cool.

430
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,700
And I Big Brand play but like, unless you can directly see a correlation to revenue, like there.

431
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,300
I don't think it worth do it.

432
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:41,800
You want it?

433
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,200
You got to keep it real with you.

434
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:50,200
We do see a correlation with that's I mean that and I some people do like in and I think well you're I mean that makes sense.

435
00:41:50,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Like first of all you're a vent platform and say like people are like oh this is cool like and that makes sense to me and but like most companies aren't seeing that, you know, they're spending three hundred four hundred thousand dollars on an event, and then they assume like, There are companies that have done an amazing job as an events.

436
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,700
Like, I worked with a marketing operations person from Anna plan and like, they were an event machine.

437
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,500
Like, they got all their leads from events, they knew how to work them.

438
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,700
They knew what they were doing, but she was always like when you to do events, and I was like, well, we have done them a lot.

439
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,300
Like, for us, it has really done that.

440
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:38,300
And I think like, you can get a sense, you know if there's like a right and it depends on your buying cycle to like if you can get somebody.

441
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:46,400
To see you in a booth and like they're willing to buy pretty fast and yeah of course Double Down, triple down, go everywhere.

442
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,400
Do it all good.

443
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:55,700
How long does it take like to do that whole evaluation process until you're at the point where like, okay all the boxes are checked.

444
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,300
I have got my dashboards and place got the right team.

445
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,000
I have got all the things in place.

446
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,200
How long does that take?

447
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:18,900
You know, I am really lucky in that I have like a core team that comes with me, but it takes me about a month to on board into a company and learn where everything is.

448
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,000
That's like the hardest part.

449
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,400
Like what?

450
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,600
Where is it?

451
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,900
And then it takes me about a month to ramp my team.

452
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,200
I do that kind of in tandem.

453
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:33,300
So like a month and a half year at, usually, they're 22 months, I am fully ramped, usually around 3 months.

454
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,500
Like I am ready to go.

455
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,300
I always want to cut it down but it takes me about that long to end.

456
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,500
And usually I mean depends on how bad things are, right?

457
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:52,500
Like it at one of the companies I was at and like I don't want to go into names but I definitely had a win within two weeks that like transform my life.

458
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,200
You know.

459
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,500
I took their cost of a sales qualified lead from 20K to the eight hundred dollars in two weeks.

460
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,300
And like, how did you do that?

461
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,400
It's just reporting.

462
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:05,300
Well, I said, well, let us do first touch and I they were driving everything to a website to free.

463
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,900
To a free product to the homepage, and I was like, huh?

464
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:11,800
That doesn't make a lot of sense.

465
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:26,300
And then within the free product like it wasn't set up to convert like the product wasn't built as a sales tool right like it'd be kind of got lost in there, and so I took all the traffic and I moved it to gated landing pages which is like super old school.

466
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,400
By the way this is like be to be 101.

467
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,000
I took all the data we had and lucky for me.

468
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:41,400
They have been doing this long time, so I had a lot of data and I went through on a keyword level through like you can just tie it all in on segment all the way to revenue.

469
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,200
Like, and I was just like anything that has not closed one on a keyword in x amount of time we kill.

470
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,700
And so it was their entire keyword list went away overnight.

471
00:44:51,700 --> 00:45:06,400
We got it down to like, you know, 40 keywords, and then it grew because I mean obviously I didn't keep it at $900 but that's like I reduce spends quite a bit too but like, I kept it at a very reasonable rate for a very long time.

472
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:25,400
You know, something that's market conditions but I do think like, I can see, correlations between like when I was out or when somebody else Managed IT, and I can see the psych urge in marketers, particularly paid marketers to spend more and, and I see this all the time, actually, in Tech this urge to change things.

473
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:36,400
I change it, change it, make it better, make it better but like actually if you think through your strategy from the get-go and you hold course in like the times of uncertainty you make.

474
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:46,900
Better decisions and like you do pivot your strategy but like if you hold longer your normalizing the data better and that is like the thing that a I can't do right?

475
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,800
Because it's going to Pivot all the time and that's not a good strategy.

476
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:58,700
Like Adding keywords all the time and adding more negative keywords and taking away things and like, doing that constantly is like very unproductive.

477
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:06,800
And like, yes, you want to do that in your agency's, doing that on some level, but like, you don't want to be a bipolar marketer.

478
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:18,800
I don't know about you, but I definitely manage paid when I go in every day and be like, oh, we go And then I say that everything and I read you the ads like and I got so paranoid.

479
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,500
I had this SDR team helping me.

480
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,300
I was like what do you think, will convert?

481
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:22,700
You know?

482
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,700
And like that's not great.

483
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,300
That's not a great situation Gone With the Wind what they're doing.

484
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:27,600
Yeah.

485
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:40,000
And then it's and then you don't know like you don't have any data about what's working, and so I like really learned from that experience of asking this por Ser to help me make banners.

486
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,100
And from that point forward, I have kind of Never done that.

487
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:48,600
I just hold like I am like okay I believe in this, and I am going to give it like before I launch.

488
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:55,300
I am like I am going to give it this amount of time this is the right amount of time and I just sit and then I like and then I learned to manage up, right?

489
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,800
Like I am just like, don't worry about it.

490
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,600
I got my Wong is a good amount of time to let it sit.

491
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,600
I think it depends on, you know, again, you're buying cycle.

492
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,700
Like, I think it takes a month.

493
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:13,100
It really takes a month in most B2B companies to get a really good feel on what quality is.

494
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,400
Is coming in because you have got generally, like, these are huge generalization.

495
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,700
Some people are much more efficient and this is where tooling becomes an important, right?

496
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:28,000
Like if you have a big sales team and you can shorten your Cycles like yeah, that's like holy s***.

497
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:35,200
That's when you buy tools because like every day you can shorten that sales cycle, it's more money in the door, it's better for everybody.

498
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,200
But like until you're at that point.

499
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,300
Don't do that.

500
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:46,300
But basically I think it takes like a lead comes in takes about a month.

501
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,400
Usually between scheduling and like getting them on a phone to get them like qualified.

502
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:00,900
Sometimes two weeks, I am trying to get it down to two weeks like but I try to give it a month at least at first and then shorten as needed and that's slow.

503
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:07,100
But I think you know instinct is everything and Everyone's probably read blank.

504
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:13,500
It's like going to date me so badly but Malcolm Gladwell was like, oh if you just like train for 10,000 hours, you can be a violinist or whatever.

505
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:19,800
But like and then his whole Spiel was like that ultimately what your training is intuition.

506
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,300
And so it's like in every gut, check the gut check is right?

507
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:40,400
And that's where you need to go as a marketer and like, I have done this a lot, so I have a pretty good Instinct on it, but like, I think that like there's yeah, I will go to my myth number three, like, which is like you, you need to spend money to make money, like not true, it's not true.

508
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,700
You need to spend some money.

509
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:50,700
Like you can't run a company without spending money, but I would spend that money on people, like humans are worth more, like they're more valuable.

510
00:48:51,100 --> 00:49:03,800
And there's this misnomer that like oh hey if I just have all the data if I just get more data, like I get this all the time, they like we want like more quiet like more For more fun and like, what are you going to do with it?

511
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,600
You can't even manage like the 6 inputs.

512
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:24,300
We have right now like what we're going to add more to this like you're just in a bad situation and so yeah, I really focus on that is like, and I think that you, if you run a really streamline marketing team, the things that actually matter in the things that can make the difference or like how you're doing the research into all of that and your product marketing team.

513
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:31,500
So like if you have a nice tight Loop or you're talking to your customers and you're getting feedback from them, you know what, ads to run You know what?

514
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,100
Two platforms.

515
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:32,500
They're on.

516
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:45,100
You're getting a lot of information and then if you're tracking it rights and you have like a good attribution system setup that's like kind of can't break, which means there's its your own system, you're pretty safe.

517
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,800
Like you can be a conservative marketer for a while until you're ready to make big bets.

518
00:49:49,800 --> 00:50:00,800
And like, there are times that I made huge, huge bets that are paid off in some Heaven, you know, like that's kind of the name of the game in marketing but like I have run big competitor.

519
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,700
Ads for spent a fortune on them.

520
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,200
Sometimes that works.

521
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,100
Sometimes it doesn't.

522
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:10,600
I have done huge conferences again like I don't know.

523
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,800
Anyway that's like--that's what I would say.

524
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,600
Yeah, okay, I am like all over the place, so I am going to, I love it.

525
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,400
Nope, we're tracking.

526
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,200
And we have got a couple of great questions.

527
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,000
Let us pull up this first question here.

528
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:33,800
How important is marketing Ops when it comes to building your marketing house?

529
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:39,200
I think that marketing Ops is the most important thing you can do is actually, I spend the most time now.

530
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:47,100
I start there because if your track like again this comes down to like how do you ingest the data?

531
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:51,700
And like there's a lot of talk around vanity metrics and like what is a vanity metric?

532
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:59,500
And like well if you go to, if you're tracking everything, you don't know what's important.

533
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,200
Like all data is not information.

534
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:14,000
Like it's like if you don't know what the important thing is I go back to this all the time, the Heap is like a tool that I have used in the past and one of the things that really irks me about It is like Jose tiger, everything like just take it all like the colors.

535
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,400
It is like everything's tag and then nobody knows what to look at.

536
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:25,800
And they're like, well, you know, like they hovered on the page for 20 minutes, and I am like, So like what are you trying to do on this page?

537
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,100
Like what is your goal?

538
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:39,100
And if you can't tell me that and data makes that hard like the world of data makes that really hard we have this like a human instinct to be like weirdos better and that's how you manage upright like you strip out the math, the metrics.

539
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,500
You give them the core of what they're looking for.

540
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,500
It's like hey your business is growing like stop looking at the MTL number.

541
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:50,400
Stop looking at like all of this you're going to get a feedback loop from sales like stop stressing out.

542
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,800
Like it's going to be okay.

543
00:51:53,300 --> 00:52:08,600
But yeah, that's kind of like my like mentality, I don't know, like, I have been like a kind of polarizing picture figurehead here because like, I think, Everyone has a different Vision on this, and but I think marketing office is like, the single most important thing you can do.

544
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,300
If you don't have a good mql system.

545
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:16,700
If you can't, like if you don't have an mql process and a standardized mql process, then your data is all over the place, right?

546
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:22,000
Like and your reactive and reactivity is never wins ever.

547
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:33,400
It's all about being thoughtful and I think Marketing in particular is the most important team to do that because like we are the team that is caught.

548
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:40,900
But first, we are the team that is seen as I have never worked in a job that someone hasn't overtly told me I am sure I could do that.

549
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:50,000
I am like, could you, you know, it's like everyone thinks they can just do it because it's all over the Internet and Linkedin is telling them they can.

550
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,700
And Facebook's telling them they can.

551
00:52:51,700 --> 00:53:01,400
Everyone is there's a book about it but like again I think that actually the patients and the like having a really strong foundation in marketing Ops is like where you win.

552
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,400
Its I would lead score.

553
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,600
The thing that I have done consistently that has been a game-changer.

554
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:18,800
It's like, dude, I don't know how many people in the room or that I am talking to you, or, like, the cro has, like a magic tool book like a cro comes in, and does this like pricing magic where Revenue grows?

555
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,800
And it's like everyone's happy, and they just like increased prices, but they did it right?

556
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,500
And they deserve a lot of credit for that because they figured out what the exact number is, right.

557
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:33,300
But like, I think that lead scoring is like that marketer Magic Moment where it's just like poof, we have the information.

558
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,900
We need we can run nurtures, we can push people.

559
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:53,600
We can open up leads when we need to, we can do a lot of things and like that's super old school and I think it's the thing that when you buy all this tool set you're not spending the time doing that foundational piece and like you know, I think that's like where you choose your marketing operations person wisely have.

560
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:58,000
A lot of power, is that one of your fashion Community mouth Talent?

561
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,400
That's the most important higher.

562
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:00,900
I hire.

563
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:19,100
I know I also think about like one thing I will say is like teen is really important to like people are only people and I think if you is there's a disruptive element to a team or there are people that don't make people feel comfortable and build trust like you're totally screwed.

564
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:35,800
So I spend a lot of energy on like who is going to add value to the team and less about the roles sometimes which is weird but it's more data is How important is we're going to the same question but cool.

565
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,400
Then finish your thought, I think like yeah.

566
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:48,000
I think like your team and your relationship with your team is so important because if you're afraid to fail in front of the people in that room and the Mark, I always tell I come in, and I start a marketing team.

567
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,100
The same no matter where I am.

568
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,900
Like this is a circle of trust now, like, you can say anything in this room, this room is safe.

569
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,000
This is a safe space.

570
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,000
We fail all the time and marketing, like, that's the thing.

571
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
People don't realize, like half the.

572
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,700
I am sure.

573
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,800
Every marketer can tell you a story about something really f****** dumb.

574
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,300
They did and I have my own way.

575
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:15,100
Believe me like Iran a million like hundreds of thousands of dollars without putting the tags on them, and I was just like oops you know, like we all make mistakes.

576
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:23,100
But if you lie about it and you cover it up and you're not able to come to the people that can help you like that's when you get into trouble.

577
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:48,900
And also if you're not, if you're not a little afraid, I would like feel comfortable feeling, you don't try anything and like you're not willing to take those big bats and So that's actually probably where I spend more energy, and so I probably higher product marketing, and like content DG first, but the third I have hired, you know, I have done a host of things where, like, I have outsourcers I was lucky in this job.

578
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:57,000
It was like something I looked at is I strong as the parking off steam before I joined because I didn't want to rebuild that again.

579
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,500
But it is something.

580
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,300
I spend a lot of time on and it's something I care about a lot, I think.

581
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,400
A lot about the sales status has to, in a way, that's weird for a marketer.

582
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,400
I think that the campaign stamping is like so important.

583
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,000
And then another thing that people are really f****** bad at naming conventions, like taking it back too.

584
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,000
Yeah, like just be consistent.

585
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,800
I think that's the it's like tooling can't do that for you.

586
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:20,600
So good.

587
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:28,400
You need to do that process consistency, process, process and like that's probably like I do that.

588
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:34,900
And the other thing I do when I build a team that I think is like, core is I give everyone in the floor for a long time.

589
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,400
Like I don't level the team really at first.

590
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:47,400
I put everyone in a room, and I am like, all right, we're all going to have this like lead meeting together.

591
00:56:47,500 --> 00:57:00,700
Until I feel that like the teens are functional in a way that like, I can just talk to the directors or whoever is leading the function because I think visibility is like also Really huge portent.

592
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,300
Yeah, and I am not a siloed work is a problem.

593
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,400
That's a whole nother topic.

594
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:13,400
We have got two more questions here, so I wanted to tackle these before.

595
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:22,400
Our time is up, if more data isn't better, is there a general data point that you found to be really useful across any company?

596
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,000
Yeah.

597
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:28,300
So Three things I guess.

598
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:40,100
Like when you're looking at advertising, it's I guess it's like there's like if you look at your big ecosystem you want to know the conversion rate from lead to mql by your core channels, inbound outbound whatever.

599
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,800
The mix has infinite.

600
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:54,300
You want to know, then a standardized mql to sales qualified or some version of that marketing qualified to sales qualified and you want to know sales qualified to close one, you need those to do your job, right?

601
00:57:54,300 --> 00:58:07,000
Like that's where you begin and then you Ali want to know by Channel like the time because usually the channels differentiate quite a bit and their conversion rates times like a LinkedIn lead doesn't usually convert as fast as a Google leaved.

602
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:30,500
You want to be very cognizant of that because what happens is that part that people don't see is like often with a big raise comes a big model where it's like we need to grow a hundred thousand million dollars tomorrow and you're like oh okay and there's a model there's always a model and how that model is structured is like how you Able to figure out what to do and like what you need to do and how many people you need to hire?

603
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:42,500
And like you know, that's the core of that problem set and so you need to know the times and you need to know the cost and then from there I think but really my like my most important number is always the cost.

604
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:46,700
Usually I like I said about sales qualified lead or an Excel is accepted lead or something.

605
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:53,400
Some version of that state it's an easy one to get usually everyone can understand it.

606
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,200
And then I think I tried very much to.

607
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,700
Then when I present above, it's like marketing leads.

608
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:12,000
I don't try, I don't like tell them the differentiations that much because I don't want anybody digging into the house until it's ready to like be presented and I think you want to give people autonomy.

609
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:22,500
So generally you're like, I don't know what his bill you do but like generally, you know, best like what your number should be and if you don't like, you need to ask the question, like, what is the goal of my job?

610
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,200
Okay, that's my f****** number.

611
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,500
Like how do I drive that and then focus on the top?

612
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,500
Like, you know I it's funny we run SEO in a really weird way.

613
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:39,900
I do look at visits to the website and Trends over time but like I am looking for consistency not like do we get 200,000 visits today?

614
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:46,200
Like okay cool like Jeff you know, like I think that's where you get in trouble and so like we want to find consistent patterns.

615
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,100
So yeah, I don't be more data better.

616
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,500
No, I don't think so, but so good.

617
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,100
You know, people would argue with me.

618
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,300
They do all Time.

619
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I think you're getting a lot of nodding heads and our crowd here so you can take a look at chat and cool.

620
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,000
One more question.

621
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:14,400
When you say that you prefer to look at marketing data in a bi tool, like Tableau alongside your other data, what's the best way that you found to get data out of HubSpot?

622
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,700
That's such a great question.

623
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,200
We use HubSpot by the way.

624
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,100
I am not the biggest HubSpot ban, so I like Marketo better.

625
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,600
So that's like bit of a thing.

626
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,900
A spy last.

627
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,900
Yeah, I mean the UI is much better and HubSpot like, let us just be real.

628
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,300
Like it's a beautiful Much Better Built tool like Marketo.

629
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,600
I am just like 1990 called like when are you going to update the s***?

630
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:42,800
And also, like, in Marketo the, it's like, you can't get out of a tab like you can literally open a tab and can't get back.

631
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,200
Like you gotta like, click out Mike.

632
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,500
Its horrific product.

633
01:00:47,400 --> 01:01:05,400
The like 121 sync with Salesforce is really valuable and you can do a lot more advanced routings in my Experienced in Marketo because if you're using Salesforce like the complexity of the Salesforce ecosystem and the amount of tools sitting on Salesforce.

634
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:13,400
If you have a big sales team, I think that Marketo is just a superior tool because it has a better eye frame for the sales team to like go in.

635
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,400
And like if you can do the interesting moments and you can do all sorts of stuff.

636
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,800
We're like HubSpot I don't think is as good as out yet.

637
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,900
I know they claim they are but like, in my opinion.

638
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,500
Also, like, I don't know, I mean Market in Marketo my whole life.

639
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,500
I have used Marketo my whole life.

640
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:35,100
It's hard to like, doesn't anybody ever feel like you have been sold something and you don't believe you were, like, good at your job unless you use a certain tool.

641
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:42,000
I feel like Marketo did a pretty good job with me, their sales force to on it, like, I don't know.

642
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,500
But yeah, I did that.

643
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,600
Try to get the data out.

644
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:55,500
Okay, so I think this is really complicated, so we do build a lot of attribution and HubSpot and a lot of the like, Like core reporting is and HubSpot right now.

645
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,200
I am having it all transferred back into a bi tool.

646
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,000
I don't know how they're doing that though.

647
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:02,900
To be honest.

648
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,400
They're doing like an API.

649
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,300
Think they're running into segments with all of the events.

650
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,300
I also don't use anymore.

651
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,800
I don't use Marketo or HubSpot for landing pages.

652
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:19,700
I am a big fan of webflow right now and I build, you know all of my landing pages in one tool.

653
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:23,100
I didn't use to do that but like, I really think that's the future.

654
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,800
And like, why would you have another?

655
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:44,100
I Used to Love instapage by the way, loves it but like they're ugly and web flow is beautiful and your designers like you get you look like a designer and I think that just makes your life easier and then with a good CMS like you can just drop a form code anywhere and so like I don't know.

656
01:02:44,200 --> 01:03:00,300
So that's how I am getting the data out and like that's why I like Salesforce so much because like basically you can push everything you need into Salesforce and then run that directly into Aunt, if I could direct call or pipe, whatever you want to call it and I don't know how well HubSpot does that.

657
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:03,700
I think it doesn't pretty well though, so I am just not as versed on it.

658
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,300
That's how I do it.

659
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,200
Amazing.

660
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,200
Wow, we're even over time, 3 minutes here.

661
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,300
Oh s***.

662
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,300
This is really, this is been so rich.

663
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,100
Thank you.

664
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,000
Okay, I am sorry.

665
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:28,300
I could talk in a while like it's like, oh yeah, we could probably do another session with you and we should but this is beautiful software by the way.

666
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:32,600
I am so impressed with your I am going to talk to my team.

667
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,200
I don't know what it cost but I don't buy software.

668
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,400
It, is it?

669
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,700
I love how easy this is to use.

670
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,300

Pain.

Can wait.

697
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:38,400
We're only watching the skies hoping for the best but expecting the worst.

698
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,300

701

Never seen it.

702
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,100
Sitting in a sandpit.

703
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,000
Life is a short trip.

704
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,900
The musics for the sad man.

705
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,800
Can you imagine this one?

706
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:06,100
Can I go now faces into the sun prison?

707
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,200
Our leaders.

708
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,300
We get into music played by the mud man.

709
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:09,700
Someone like what is someone like the he some of the many in some other be sooner or later they all will be gone.

710
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:19,400
Why don't they stay it's so hard to get on without it cause I don't want to perish.

711
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:27,600
Like a fading us cues like diamonds in the Sun and diamonds are forever.
