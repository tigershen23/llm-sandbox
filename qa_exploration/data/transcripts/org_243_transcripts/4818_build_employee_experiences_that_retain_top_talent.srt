00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,100
All right, so jumping into today's program.

18
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:15,700
We're going to start off with an amazing panel, with a couple of great leaders, Roberto Ortiz, co-founder and CEO of welcome and Jason from bucket list, rewards.

19
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:31,400
They have a lot to share with us their, and then we're going to end our time with Marta from marvelous, where she's going to walk us through a mental emotional exercise, and you're going to feel grounded and well, Balanced coming out of this time.

20
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,900
So, does that sound good?

21
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,500
I would love to see you in chat.

22
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,000
If you guys are resonating.

23
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,700
Give me, give me a firechat.

24
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,800
Give me something a fist bump, what not.

25
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,100
Thank you, Madeline.

26
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,900
There we go.

27
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,200
Alright, people feel in this cool.

28
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,100
So, you know, talking about our panel.

29
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:58,600
There's some Gallop stats that I am sure some of you are familiar with, but nearly 85 percent of employees, worldwide are not engaged at work.

30
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,300
I That's a crazy staggering number.

31
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:10,300
And so, you know Gallup will mention that the number one reason why these engagement programs or whatnot.

32
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:18,600
Our failure failing not working is because Employee Engagement is not owned by the leaders themselves.

33
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,800
It's not an expectation held on managers, or is it fully understood by employees?

34
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:36,900
And so that's why I am so excited to bring up Roberto and who are leaders, their CEOs, co-founders, who are infusing Employee Engagement into the DNA of their companies.

35
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,200
So, would you join me, Roberto and Jason on stage?

36
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,900
Hi, thank you both.

37
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,400
How are you?

38
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,300
Doing great.

39
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,800
I did Dean II.

40
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,500
I am always amazed by the energy.

41
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,800
You bring to the stage, and I am always like thinking about when I jump on stage.

42
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,700
I am probably not going to be able to keep up.

43
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,800
But here we are.

44
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
I am glad to be here.

45
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,200
Jason.

46
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,600
Thanks for taking time to be here as well.

47
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,200
I am looking forward to the topic.

48
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,400
Its top of mind for leaders at every company.

49
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,300
Is this idea of just employee experiences Talent retention?

50
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,300
How do we drive?

51
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,300
The right coaches, we want in our company, so I am here for, I am glad to be here.

52
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:47,700
Hey Jason, you know, I think what's interesting if both of you can maybe intro and kick this panel discussion off with the DNA of your companies because I do think just like I shared with that Gallup step, you know, a lot of the failures of Employee Engagement programs is due to the lack of ownership at the leadership level.

53
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,500
But both of you are passionate about your employees about your people.

54
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,600
And I know that firsthand with Roberto Jason the moments that I have Able to engage with you.

55
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,200
I can feel the passion off of you and you're constantly thinking about Gentiles.

56
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,800
So, could you both speak to your organization's?

57
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,100
Just a little bit, like what you all do?

58
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,200
And how Employee Engagement is infused in your DNA?

59
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,500
Yeah, I would be happy to and Jenna.

60
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,000
Thank you so much for the really warm welcome.

61
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,100
I Deco I love the energy and it's just a pleasure to be participating in to today's session.

62
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:32,100
I will maybe give you the 30-second overview into bucket list and just a little bit a couple of reasons why it's so important to me personally.

63
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,000
Well buckets rewards is an employee rewards and recognition platform.

64
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,700
And I think as everybody here, probably knows, when you take great care of your employees, they stick around longer, and they perform better.

65
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,300
At the heart of our platform.

66
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,000
That's what it's all about.

67
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,600
It's about recognizing outstanding contributions and really rewarding people in a meaningful way.

68
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,800
Ideally, try to make dreams come true, whether they are small or very, very big and culture for me is from day one.

69
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,500
This is a third tech company.

70
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:11,100
I built it scaled over the years and the theme I have seen time and again, is it always comes down to the people surrounded by the Mission Vision and values.

71
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,200
And if you get that right, you can create an Unstoppable force and have just a ton of fun in that Journey as well.

72
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,000
So, that's kind of little bit about me and why cultures important.

73
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,200
But Rob, I would love to get your insights on this as well?

74
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,200
Yeah.

75
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,600
Yeah.

76
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,300
Thanks, Jason.

77
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,000
I love making dreams come true.

78
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,900
That's super aspirational.

79
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,000
I love it, you know, over, I mean at welcome.

80
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,600
You guys first of all, welcome to welcome.

81
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,900
This is our platform.

82
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,500
What we do on our side is we partner with companies that care about employee experiences and help them.

83
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,200
Form these Keystone employee experiences to having engaging ones.

84
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,300
All right, and we know that the distributed Workforce.

85
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,900
We have to be much more intentional about every touch point with our employees, right on that employee Journey.

86
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,100
There are these Keystone experiences that should be elevated, and we should make every meeting count.

87
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,700
And I think that's, that's one of the key drivers for us in the season to supporting companies like that.

88
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,600
At a high level though.

89
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:17,200
We are also accompanied ourselves, not just supporting companies Drive, amazing experiences and Nature but also on my side I think about this every single day.

90
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,600
How do we make sure that our employees during the right position to thrive?

91
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,900
Not just at work but at home and I think that the at-home part has become so important.

92
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:45,500
Now, I think this last couple of years people have taken the opportunity to assess things in a real way, assess what's important to them, assess just distribute like the distribution of work and the flexibility that comes with that.

93
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:52,400
And I think what is required of us as Leaders is to be mindful about that and not just, hey, what are you executing at home?

94
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,500
I mean, at work, we're all.

95
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,200
So, what are you executing at home?

96
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:03,200
And I think for us as we're building the culture at welcome, we take that to heart and it's about the entire employee.

97
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,900
Not just what they can do for us.

98
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So good.

99
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:18,300
I love to hear of just the authenticity of this passion heart actually being threaded in the DNA of the organization.

100
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,600
So, thank you for sharing that.

101
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:36,700
You know, we are in this employee era where retaining employees is obviously the top topic and organizations need to do things differently and probably need to be a little bit more intentional about the way they look at employee.

102
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,300
The engagement.

103
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,300
What are some things that both of you are seeing that successful organizations?

104
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,000
Your customers are doing for hybrid teams today?

105
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,300
Yeah, I am robbed.

106
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,900
You want to leave?

107
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,800
Go first, sir.

108
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,500
Are you can, you can go for it?

109
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,300
I think thank you.

110
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,100
Thanks very much.

111
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:04,300
Um, I will share some experiences that we have implemented but also share some things we have seen some of our customers doing as well.

112
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:22,500
So in also tied to that bucket list were recognized as one of the top 50 best corporate cultures in Canada, and I don't mention that as a bragging I am super proud of it, but it's just a, it's a measure of all the things we have implemented internally.

113
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:41,800
That's culture is as I mentioned before so near and dear to what we do but I the two stories are two quick examples that I have seen have a big impact is first, I think it's super important to be so intentional about the whole employee experience, and something we have done, is we have taken the time to map it, map it out, and its entirety.

114
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,900
So, everything from the first touch point, so when somebody sends in their resume for Sample to a job to the first interview.

115
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,800
Second interview.

116
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,200
We have mapped out before they start day one week, one, 30 60 90 days.

117
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
And once that was all mapped out.

118
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,700
We then surveyed staff as they go through that entire cycle to find out where we're strong.

119
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,900
They were weak.

120
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:08,400
And when you uncover these weaknesses in your employee experiences, your then better and power to up to address those things.

121
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,300
And so we have been able to create a really repeatable scalable employee experience for all our staff.

122
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,000
And then the second thing we did.

123
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:25,000
In tandem with that is, we made it a one of our corporate rocks to have a, an absolutely delightful employee onboarding experience.

124
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,000
Specifically, we decided to survey all new employees joining the team.

125
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,200
And our goal was to score 9 out of 10 or higher.

126
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,000
And after two quarters of running the survey.

127
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,800
We have an average score of about a nine point six out of ten.

128
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
And I think it that's just as a result of being.

129
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,600
So deliberate about mapping the entire experience out, identifying the weaknesses.

130
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,700
And then also we made it pop, we made the leaders publicly accountable, and we shared everybody's results publicly.

131
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,200
So like I am holding leader.

132
00:14:53,900 --> 00:15:03,200
The onboarding leader like we held their toes to the fire if you will to be super accountable to providing a delightful experience, but those are just a couple of things we have done.

133
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,800
Yeah.

134
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,300
Yeah, Robert over to you sir.

135
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,400
Yeah.

136
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,900
Yeah.

137
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,600
I love that.

138
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,700
I love the taking the surveys.

139
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,300
After every employee on board.

140
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,000
We do some very Lawyers, well, I think you know, the way we have been mapping it out.

141
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,900
We think about it as an employee success in general, right?

142
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,800
And the idea that companies have a so much time.

143
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,600
So much energy into customer success.

144
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:43,600
It's an entire sometimes at companies and is one of the biggest teams it makes up one third of a company's head count many ways, and they exist only to make sure that the customers to cuss well, and then the question we're asking is like, what does that look like for our employee success?

145
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,800
And so, Jason back to your point of map and Entire employee Journey.

146
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,200
We were looking at these the same thing and asking the question.

147
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,600
Okay, how do we put those same levels intention into equipping?

148
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,200
Our employees to be successful retaining them and helping them Thrive.

149
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,800
What does that look like and mapping out those touch points?

150
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,500
I think what we're seeing also just in the market in general because we see a lot of companies.

151
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,700
We partner with a lot of companies that are in this space, right?

152
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,500
I am talking to HR leaders every day.

153
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,000
I am talking to people that are part of internal.

154
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:25,800
I am saying trying to drive these employee experiences and what I am finding is that It's just the top item in conversation.

155
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,700
Like it's a top item in conversation.

156
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:34,800
And but there's a big gap as well between angry when you talk about holding toes to the fire of leaders.

157
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,100
I think that's really important.

158
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,400
Right?

159
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Like top five issues across the board for HR leaders.

160
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
There's a few of them that you think about it.

161
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,200
It's like, how do we make sure that we actually drive change forward?

162
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:57,800
So, for instance, you know, there was this Gardener report at one of Do the top five, one of them I recall was future of work at the top of my conversation for everybody.

163
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:09,300
Distributed, Workforce is top of my conversation, but less than 40% of people feel like they have actual plan to address the shifting landscape, right?

164
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:20,000
And so what we're seeing our customers do is actually put a lot of intention behind that and drive, not just technology, but experiences of those employees forward.

165
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,600
So for instance, you know, one of our Murmurs, they're being super intentional about hosting these monthly employee company-wide experiences.

166
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,200
Why?

167
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:44,100
Because you're for that remote employee for a distributed Workforce that person is going from their bed to their desk and then back to the kitchen and sort of that's like their commute.

168
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,400
It's just a couple steps away and there's isolation that case in and all these other things that kick in.

169
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,100
And so no longer are the perks of Beautiful office.

170
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,900
I used to work at Google and it was fantastic.

171
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:00,700
Going from the third floor to the first floor on a slide and grab your latte on the way to the next meeting.

172
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,000
All that goes away.

173
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,800
All that goes away.

174
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,800
So what it does it make it so that us as Leaders?

175
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:13,800
We have to actually provide value beyond the perks and that just invites deeper conversation.

176
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:24,400
And so what we're seeing our customers do is be intentional about the space, be much more intentional and I think you know, with folks that are shown Own up today and sort of events that we posted the past.

177
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:32,300
And the future is evident that people are looking for ways to solve and close the gaps of Employee Engagement and culture.

178
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:45,300
So anyway, I will stop there Gina, but super, super exciting to see sort of the intention sort of surface to the top and maybe it was a crisis that made it happen.

179
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,000
And say, hold on the things that's most important is our people.

180
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,600
We have to put more attention about this.

181
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
What does that look like?

182
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,000
And so that's what I have been seeing.

183
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,000
On my side, you know, I want to pull a thread a little bit more.

184
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,100
You were both talking about holding leadership accountable.

185
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Now if that statistic from Gallup says that the number one reason to failure of Engagement programs is because a lack of ownership from leaders, how are you all doing that today?

186
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,700
How do you keep the leaders accountable to driving these initiatives forward?

187
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,800
I will start off with Jesus.

188
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:27,300
You took the last one and I think, I think it starts with us, right at the end of the day.

189
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,200
Founders and CEOs, the buck stops there.

190
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,800
And, so I think that we just have to take ownership of what's right?

191
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,500
And what's wrong for us.

192
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:51,400
We do a quarterly post survey, and we just got results recently, and they're not the ones I was looking to continue to crush and continue to grow and it's like, okay, like we got some work to do.

193
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,800
And the question is, what do I do about that?

194
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,300
Do I say?

195
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:54,500
Okay.

196
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:08,200
I am just going to keep taking customer calls and investor calls and Keep working on the product feature, or we can actually put more intention and keep growing employee satisfaction and I think it starts and stops there Gina, I think from a leadership perspective.

197
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,000
Then it becomes that from there're managers.

198
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:25,600
And the idea that your managers are actually, you know, when I am interviewing managers, and I am thinking about this, you know, they're responsible for a big portion of your people in many times, in many ways.

199
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,900
They're responsible for the culture that Is marinated in there.

200
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:39,900
Something you can say from the top and say, these are our core values as a difference in terms of the practicality of that being carried out at the team level and at the individual level.

201
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:47,500
And, so I think it starts at the top and then it goes right into the management and I think measuring things is what we have to do.

202
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:59,200
So for us, looking at Polk survey, whether their quarterly or more frequent and that having skip levels, so that we understand sort of not just for more direct reports what's happening, but also, So, what are other folks?

203
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,700
That other organizations that you typically don't have time with?

204
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,700
How do you break bread with them and understand?

205
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,800
Hey, how can we improve your job?

206
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,700
How can we improve the work that you're trying to do, and what you're trying to accomplish?

207
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:17,700
And so, I think it starts with us at the top and then obviously our Frontline managers to be held accountable.

208
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,500
Yeah, I think that's a super good summary Rob.

209
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,600
I may decide just a couple of bullet points that even Echo a lot of the key things.

210
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,100
Saying, but like are saying is like the fish will rot from the head down.

211
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:40,900
So unless your leadership really walks to talk, like you're not going to get buy-in alignment and I truly believe everything kind of Rises and falls with leadership as well.

212
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:52,300
So leaders have to be accountable for the failures and also ideally push down the winds to the team, but in terms of creating accountability, I think there's a lot of systems and processes you can do to drive down accountability.

213
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,600
So it's not just the seat does.

214
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,000
This should not be should not rest just on the CEOs shoulder.

215
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,600
They should be the champion up there.

216
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,900
We should be the torchbearer.

217
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:06,600
I believe in and around culture, but a good CEO should create alignment and simplicity around these sort of goals.

218
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:14,100
And so, for example, as I mentioned before setting a quarterly goal, that's public you shared with your company or your team.

219
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,800
So, we use okrs objective key results.

220
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,100
We know whatever your company may do.

221
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,800
I highly, Advocate sharing those publicly not, just with the leadership team, but the entire company.

222
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:32,000
And so we have our, okay, ours, this That typically sit with the leadership team and there will be a Leaders name assigned to it.

223
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:47,500
We talked about those every week, and we say whether the green yellow or red and then on a monthly basis, we share our progress with the entire company and a company wide, how everybody can kind of full transparency on whether we're green yellow or red fork over a great culture.

224
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:55,000
And there's the result when you stay at a goal publicly and then attach some of these name to it and then see what you're on track or off track.

225
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
That's a beautifully.

226
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,600
Simple way to drive accountability.

227
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,500
You know, it's we have had a lot of, we have had a lot of success with that.

228
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:07,200
And again, it anchors into that the public transport were super transparent about everything we do here.

229
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,500
So, I am a big believer of that.

230
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:19,000
When you say on track or off track, what are some examples of quantifiable ways that you can track the success of Employee Engagement.

231
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:27,600
So for example, the onboarding goal of getting an, a score of 9 or higher out of 10, that score was made public with the entire.

232
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:35,600
You so green scored benign or higher, a yellow scored kind of be 7 point 5, to 8 in red is sub 7.5.

233
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,100
So that's attached a number to it.

234
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,600
Make it green, yellow, or red and then share it with everybody.

235
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,800
So they can see how we're doing.

236
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:43,700
This.

237
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:50,300
Really inside bar, color coding is really motivational, like you could you can be had an outstanding result.

238
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,700
But if it's in the red people do not like that.

239
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,500
Whether you're a sales rep, whether you're ahead of culture, you only find him.

240
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,900
People simple markers that are shared with the team can again drop performance and accountability.

241
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,000
So That's a great tip.

242
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,300
Thank you for that.

243
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,000
Both of you.

244
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,200
We're going to go into Q&A.

245
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,900
I, it looks like we actually do have some questions coming in.

246
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,700
Oh, this is great.

247
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,100
All right.

248
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,000
First question is from Spencer.

249
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,100
It's for you Jason.

250
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:25,200
What were some of the weaknesses you uncovered in your onboarding process that you think everyone could learn from?

251
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:33,000
So I am gonna, I am gonna go big picture, obvious ones, and I will talk about some more recent ones because we're constantly surveying for feedback.

252
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:42,900
So, Early in the process prior to building a true culture part of me prior to hiring for and Building Systems people and systems.

253
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,800
Cultures.

254
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,900
One of the things we did.

255
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,500
That's so obvious that I think everybody will know, but it's embarrassing and it's for the sake of transparency.

256
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,200
I will mention it.

257
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,000
We ghosted some of the candidates who applied with us.

258
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,400
So like sometimes people would apply, and we didn't reply to everybody since we have committed to providing a really transparent high-level communication.

259
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,800
Everybody gets a response.

260
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,900
So there's no ghosting in the application process.

261
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,400
Process.

262
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:18,600
I know that one's kind of obvious but for my informal and formal research, it's a pretty common theme that a lot of companies are guilty of that and that I also was guilty of and then more recently, I have as our systems, become more evolved.

263
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Some we're getting really granular, and we're starting to appreciate how we onboard different team members matters.

264
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:38,200
So at first we had a one consistent kind of onboarding process that I thought was pretty sweet, but for example in sales, the sales team will teach them in the Worried about Discovery demo and Etc, but it turns out on day one.

265
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,700
They really want to get a big picture of exactly how the product works.

266
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,800
They want to see like what the heck they want context.

267
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
What the heck, am I selling?

268
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,100
So in that last piece of feedback, I shared that was based upon.

269
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,300
I did a met with some of the new account Executives who just met joined our team.

270
00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:03,400
And I would ask them like, where we strong, where we weaken our onboarding, and they share, there's a bunch of great stuff, but they had shared having detailed insights into exactly other product works from day.

271
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,600
One would be early viable.

272
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,500
So those are just kind of too top of mine things that I have seen recently.

273
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,000
I would add on to that, just a bit.

274
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,700
I had a great conversation with another CEO about comparing notes about onboarding and interviewing.

275
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:27,600
And I think it's worth were saying that especially in this market like Your time as a Founder.

276
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:37,900
As a leader, jumping on calls, with candidates jumping on cost, to close them, jumping on costs, understand like what their goals are, even beyond your company, I think is super important.

277
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:48,500
And so making time for that Canada to feel like you can say like I really want this candidate, but if they don't feel they're on the other side, it's not real.

278
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,300
It's not real.

279
00:26:49,300 --> 00:27:16,400
And, so I make time to show up for those candidates who are making a big decision, you know, when I am interviewing And by the way, all of our Founders three founders, we interviewed every single candidate at welcome, we committed to until we can no longer because of time, time constraints, but we're going to keep doing that for as long as we can and, you know, at the end like part of the last interview, and I am typically doing the last, the last touch point on an interview at that point.

280
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,600
I am just really just getting to know the person story.

281
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:26,000
So they're coming in prepped with all their things and sort of all the tough because my team, I really trusted my team has done their due diligence.

282
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Diligence on this candidate at this point.

283
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,800
I just want to get to know who she is.

284
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,300
Like what's like, what's your biggest challenge right now?

285
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,100
Even Beyond welcome, how can we help like, what does that look like?

286
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:45,700
And just get to know them and their story and I think us being able to even like make sure that everyone that interview that candidate if the offer is out to them.

287
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,800
It doesn't hurt for people to drop them at extract from a message up with an email and say, hey, we're excited about the potential of working with you.

288
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,700
Let me know how we can answer any questions?

289
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,900
It just makes it especially in the remote world where you're not meeting people face-to-face, and grab a coffee or grab a lunch with them.

290
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,200
We just had to be more intentional and leaning into those conversations.

291
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Those are some great practical tips and points.

292
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,600
Thank you.

293
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,900
Alexandria.

294
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,400
Lane has a question.

295
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,900
What is an example?

296
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:21,400
Of an intention besides collaboration when redesigning the in-office experience.

297
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,500
It's a great question, and I am pretty sure.

298
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:25,800
Jason.

299
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,900
You have some, some thoughts to what you're seeing in the market, especially around employee recognition.

300
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,900
I think I will answer this from The Experience side of a distributed Workforce.

301
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:44,100
And so, you know, besides collaboration and sort of like thinking how the office experience should be.

302
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:50,700
I think, I think, attention shows up a lot in the in-betweens that goes ignored in many ways.

303
00:28:51,400 --> 00:29:02,600
So for instance, you know, higher Employee, let us say you have a headquarters in New York and la and Austin but you're hiring someone that lives in Tennessee, and she is the only employee in Tennessee.

304
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,900
It's all the in-betweens of thinking about that employee as if that's the most important point.

305
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,700
We at your company.

306
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,800
And asking the question, what is her experience?

307
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,400
What is her experience from Tennessee?

308
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,800
She's not going to be anybody else for a long time until we hire some other people, maybe start pod and Tennessee.

309
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,200
What is her experience?

310
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:38,700
And going back to what Jason was saying, map and I have experienced, but bringing the attention down to even those and I go back to from what I am seeing in the market, you know, our customers, they're taking that little contention into every touchpoint from the employee onboarding.

311
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,300
How do we make that better than another Zoom call or performance, review, call or interview cop?

312
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:52,600
From the company Town Hall, which is the most important event at your company, that builds culture and drives the values of the company.

313
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,800
How do we do that better?

314
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:08,000
Then just another call, like the whole another call, that's the easy way out putting intention and to and fill in the gaps in something they want is for that person, especially that's not submitted to, the office goes, goes really, really far.

315
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,700
And that's just one example of what we're seeing, how our companies are taking that and little contention.

316
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:24,900
Nice, I might kind of share an idea around like if it sounds like the question is around, understanding how to create better collaboration in person and virtually in hybrid.

317
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:33,300
I think what we're trying to do is Design Systems that work in both environments and I will share a couple of examples of things that seem to work really well.

318
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,900
So, I think fundamentally there's this huge desire for human connection.

319
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,000
No surprises there.

320
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:45,000
And so what we're trying to be to Rob's point is we're trying to create all these, what we call them micro moments where people can connect ideally in a day.

321
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,900
Basis and have meaningful connection.

322
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:54,000
And so, one thing we have done that works well in person or remotely as we do a daily huddle, a daily scrum.

323
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,500
So everybody in the entire company to 10 minute long meeting, they get broken up into small groups, and these aren't the normal functional groups.

324
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,600
It's not like software developers of soft, develop software developers.

325
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:14,900
It's like, it can be like a customer success person, an Ops person, a software engineer their lumped together in small groups of sort of 7 to 10 people, and they talk about one personal goal and one work goal.

326
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,200
Every single day and it's really cool.

327
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,100
You hear about what matters in their life.

328
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,300
And like, for example, we have one software engineer, mark, an amazing guy.

329
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,000
He's done a, he's hit 100 over 100 days streak on Duolingo.

330
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,200
I know that he's learning Spanish, which is amazing.

331
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,500
Just the other day.

332
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:37,700
I learned one of our sdrs Guillermo wants to do his MBA and I as a CEO, I could potentially be in a good position to help them maybe with educational practice.

333
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,000
Maybe just some time off.

334
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:48,100
So creating these micro moments in a very deliberate matter is super powerful and the other thing is It's not it's obviously not just about me but about connecting the team.

335
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,600
And so yeah, every single day on video 10 minutes long, the whole team connects.

336
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:59,200
And then one other the way you wrap it up, everybody comes back together in one big room, and we are we asked a fun fact question.

337
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,700
So one person lost the question.

338
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,600
One person will answer it, and they're kind of playful silly questions.

339
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,600
But again, it creates humor creates his likeness in the day.

340
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:14,900
And yesterday's question, for example, was, if you're on a baseball team, what would be your entrance song and the fellowship?

341
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,200
Has meant so, so run.

342
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,900
I am sorry friend of but love it.

343
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,000
Like it's it connects people and yet to hear you get to see the human side of what people are all about.

344
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:36,400
So, I think these are micro moments can be, well, then important is to create repeatable scalable systems that you can stamp into your company, whether it's us or yourself and create fun environment.

345
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:44,000
So Jason, what was your wish your entry song to the baseball game, so I didn't answer it, but I will tell you Shawn.

346
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,500
He's like just because like here comes the bride.

347
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,900
So Sean's not married.

348
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,400
I don't know.

349
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,300
It was just a random answer ever and then there's the Rick Ashley song.

350
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,400
Somebody else answered.

351
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,200
Never going to give up.

352
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,300
So it was like, oh, that's fun.

353
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,200
Playful silliness.

354
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,300
That's fine.

355
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,200
That's great.

356
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,400
That's awesome.

357
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,900
Love this micro moment ideas.

358
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,800
That's great.

359
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:14,900
All right, we have time for one last question, and I am already cutting into some of the meditation time, but we have got some good up votes on this question.

360
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,800
From Abby.

361
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,900
So Rob.

362
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,400
Jason, if you can make a quick, that would be great.

363
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,600
How do you keep employees, engaged and connected in a fully remote Workforce?

364
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,500
What are some exciting ideas?

365
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,700
You have seen for remote employees.

366
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,500
I think you have covered some of them, but are there any others?

367
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,400
Yeah, I will cover 11.

368
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,100
That we do here.

369
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,500
Welcome.

370
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,000
We call it the welcome Cafe and it's a No Agenda.

371
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:47,100
It's picture yourself walking into the building and you're gonna go grab coffee at the Adding space and you bump into some employees.

372
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,700
And so, is an unstructured way.

373
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,200
It's a happens at noon, East Coast, which is 9 AM Pacific.

374
00:33:53,500 --> 00:34:09,000
And so, whether you're having your first cup of coffee, or just starting to eat your lunch, we encourage employees to drop by and have unstructured conversations and so on, welcome, we basically have some tunes that you land into in this Auditorium and then you go into some Lounge.

375
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,199
We call them now and we call them Lounge rooms.

376
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,400
You can go and grab a table, sit down and have a conversation and it's Interesting.

377
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:22,100
Because someone there's a few employees here at, welcome, learning, Spanish, kind of keeping the Duolingo thing going learning Spanish.

378
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,600
And they created a table within the welcome Cafe called, welcome espanyol.

379
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,000
And now, people are jumping in there, and they're practicing their Spanish.

380
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:44,900
And, so I think what we're seeing is structured and unstructured ways where you have the structured opportunities of company Town Hall employee experience, onboarding, all these ERT group communities really making those cow.

381
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:53,699
Whether you have these unstructured ways of just holding space, whether that's for a light conversation or a deeper conversation.

382
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,100
It's about just making space for those conversations.

383
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,500
That's awesome.

384
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,200
I love it.

385
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,500
And then again, really quickly.

386
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:10,500
That one thing I might add, is we to part, quick answer, we have weekly one-to-ones between all team leads, and all employees.

387
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,200
And one of the questions we asked is what's on your bucket list and I like, how can we support you in that journey?

388
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,300
And in summary if you can help an employee achieve, what matters most to them.

389
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,800
Like, that's how you break that traditional employee-employer barrier and you come alongside as I can.

390
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Partner in life.

391
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:35,000
And I tell you if you want to see people light up, you f*** find out what matters to them and you help them achieve it and it could be something incredibly Spa.

392
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,800
Maybe there are stray.

393
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,400
It could be something incredibly simple.

394
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Maybe they're single mom.

395
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Maybe they work in healthcare, given the day off, sending them to the spa, can be massively impactful, maybe something, bigger middle of traveling or wine, sending them to Napa Valley, can be, you know, really meaningful as well.

396
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,400
Whatever.

397
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,100
It is, find out what that thing is and help them achieve it and you're going to break that barrier.

398
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:04,200
You can become a mentor or a cheerleader in their life, and they're never going to forget you as a leader colleague or friend.

399
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,000
So good, got a snap.

400
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Amazing.

401
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,700
Wow.

402
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,500
Well, thank you so much Roberto Jason.

403
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:22,400
It is a pleasure to hear from each of your experiences and inspiring quite honestly to see how you are executing employee experiences within your org.

404
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,500
So, thank you so much, and we're going to actually transition now.

405
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,400
Into our marvelous experience.

406
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,500
So, let us all clear our minds, like, keep those insights.

407
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Keep those amazing golden nuggets that are applicable to you.

408
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,700
And now we're going to move into a session with Marda.

409
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,100
But before we jump into that, we want to take a quick poll.

410
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,400
So Jessica is my producer.

411
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,800
Thanks, Jess for putting that up on stage.

412
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,100
How are you feeling right now?

413
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,700
And all of you can just click one through ten.

414
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,900
One being the worst ten being absolutely marvelous.

415
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,500
How are you feeling?

416
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,500
All right.

417
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,100
Okay, we have got some, a lot of AIDS which is great some fives and fours.

418
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,300
Well, we're going to take this poll again at the end of this event.

419
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,900
So we hope to see some of that, adjust Marta, take it away for us.

420
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,300
Thanks, Gina.

421
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,500
And hello everyone.

422
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,300
My name is Marta Kagan.

423
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,800
I am the co-founder of marvelous.

424
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,400
And if you have never heard of marvelous, you're going to get to know us right now.

425
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,600
We are on a mission to help humans flourish through mental, emotional Fitness.

426
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,300
Now, what is mental, emotional Fitness?

427
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,800
Some of you may be familiar with that.

428
00:37:42,800 --> 00:38:02,500
You may already have your own practice, but if you're not the best way to think of it is the analogy of physical fitness, you know, you Physical fitness to get stronger to build stamina, endurance, resilience to be more flexible and to perform at our physical best.

429
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,200
We could do the same thing for our mental emotional, state for our inner world.

430
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:22,600
And if we can Master our inner world, if we can become more self-aware that are able to self-regulate that are able to bounce back from setbacks and failures, then we can show up and feel marvelous and be Arboles every day.

431
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:39,600
And so what we offer, our inner workouts, back to the fitness analogy, like the one you're going to experience today coaching support Community accountability, all kinds of ways to support you on your journey, to flourishing to showing up and being your best every single day.

432
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:48,600
The important thing I want to point out here is we have this philosophy at marvelous, that it doesn't matter what the Day brings to you, right?

433
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,500
It doesn't matter if you had a great onboarding experience.

434
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,100
Answer not.

435
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:58,200
I mean it does matter, no offense Jason and Rob but what really matters is what you bring to the day, right?

436
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:58,800
It matters.

437
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,000
How you respond to situations that may not be ideal.

438
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,500
It matters.

439
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,700
How you respond to feedback, you get that isn't desired.

440
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So we are about helping you bring your very best to the day, no matter what that day, May throw at you.

441
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,600
All right to begin.

442
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:21,400
I am going to take you today through one of my favorite mini mental, emotional workouts.

443
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,800
It's called the three, two one.

444
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,900
And it is something I do literally almost daily.

445
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,400
So I am going to take you through it.

446
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,200
I am going to teach you what, you can experience it and something that you can do not just right now.

447
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:42,500
But tomorrow, the next day, anytime you need, the equivalent of the control, alt delete button on your mental emotional state.

448
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,400
It's a beautiful way to reset relatively quickly.

449
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,100
You can even take pieces of it apart and use them as needed.

450
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,400
But we're going to do three, two, one, and what that involves.

451
00:39:51,700 --> 00:40:05,400
Is three rounds of breath work to moments of gratitude and one moment of power, and I am going to explain what each of those are before I start, I am just going to ask you this mental.

452
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,900
Emotional Fitness is not a spectator sport just like you wouldn't go to the gym and watch people, you know workout and go.

453
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,000
Yeah, I am good.

454
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,800
I feel fit.

455
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,700
You gotta do the work.

456
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,400
The same is true for mental, emotional Fitness.

457
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,100
So please join me.

458
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,400
Do this stuff with me.

459
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,300
Going to count you out.

460
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:28,500
I am going to coach him and explain everything but Let us make this a participation not observation moment.

461
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,800
All right, the three, two one.

462
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,500
We're going to begin with three rounds of breath work.

463
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,100
Now, why breathwork we take roughly 22,000?

464
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,700
Breaths a day, something along those lines and most of them, we don't pay attention to.

465
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,200
We take it for granted.

466
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,200
They just happen if we can tune into just a few, just a few minutes of our breathing.

467
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,400
It's an opportunity for us to shut off.

468
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:11,700
Autopilot the program that's running in our head to step away from worries, thoughts, judgments to-do, lists to tune, into our bodies, to tune into how we feel internally and to tune into just the present moment.

469
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,300
It gives us that control-alt-delete starting point.

470
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:20,000
So we're going to do some intentional breathing and to get started.

471
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,400
I want you to put your hands on your belly.

472
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,500
First of all, make sure you're seated.

473
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,800
It sometimes when people do breath work for the first time, or they do, you know, type, they haven't done before.

474
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,500
You can get a little bit lightheaded.

475
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,100
And, so I want to make sure you're safe and seated.

476
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,200
So, take a seat.

477
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:42,500
If you're not sitting in the, put your hands on your belly and then go ahead and take a big deep breath in at your own pace.

478
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,100
And notice what happens with your hand?

479
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:54,000
See if you can feel your belly, Rising, as you inhale and then falling as you exhale, or does your belly sort of stay still and most of that breathing happen up here.

480
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,100
Now, if you're a belly breather, good, that's what I want you to do.

481
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:04,900
If you're not, if you took a deep inhale, and then on the exhale, you didn't feel anything happen.

482
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,100
You're probably breathing, more up in your chest.

483
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,800
And that's okay.

484
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,000
A lot of us do that.

485
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:17,900
We're going to try to focus on belly breathing because that's going to give us a chance to really use our diaphragm to fully engage our full lung capacity.

486
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,400
Get more oxygenation.

487
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,500
We're going to feel it more.

488
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,400
We're going to enjoy it more.

489
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,600
It's going to benefit us more.

490
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,500
You're going to put your hands on your belly.

491
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:31,000
And we're going to start off with simple inhales and exhales for about 30 seconds.

492
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,100
So simple inhales and exhales.

493
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,000
I am going to count you out.

494
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,300
We're going to inhale, exhale, inhale.

495
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,900
Exhale, keep your hands on your belly as accuse.

496
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,400
You can kind of notice on the inhale belly goes out.

497
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,600
Exhale it goes in.

498
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,400
This is going to be relatively not too fast, not too slow.

499
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,200
But again, if you start to feel light-headed or uncomfortable, you can stop at any point in this process from there.

500
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,700
We're going to switch to a couple other movements, and we're to do three cycles.

501
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,800
So you're gonna have a Q on the screen, and I am going to talk you through it.

502
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,200
All you need to do is listen and breathe.

503
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,700
Are you ready?

504
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,700
All right, hands on the belly and begin again with just one.

505
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,700
Nice deep inhale through the nose.

506
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,200
And exhale through the mouth.

507
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,800
And here we go.

508
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:33,000
Inhale one, exhale, one, inhale to Exhale to inhale, three, exhale, three, inhale four exhale for inhale.

509
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,800

Empty just in the present moment.

We're going to repeat that round for a moment.

562
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,900
Just feel what you feel.

563
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:12,800
Let your body settle, let your breath go back to its natural state and take this moment just to observe whatever sensation may be there.

564
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,900
Maybe you feel some tingling in your fingers or your face.

565
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,800
Maybe feel a little Renewed Energy.

00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,600
But you're trying to get maximum are maximum use.

585
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,800

Keep it up 23! Exhale 24.

591
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,800
Just focusing on the breath.

592
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:28,000
The belly 25, just kidding.

593
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,800

594
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:41,200
No, laughing just breathing 27 and exhale, 28, exhale, 29, exhale.

And 30, exhale, beautiful.

596
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,700
Now, inhale once more for me and exhale, then hold the lungs, empty for count of 30.

597
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,500
Here we go.

598
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,100
Just holding the breath nose closed.

599
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,800
We have got about 25, 20 seconds to go.

600
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,200
Try and hold it in the whole time.

601
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,200
They're guessed.

602
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,200
Hold it out, because we exhaled not letting air in.

603
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,200
In just sitting with it.

604
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,800
Just feeling what you feel about, 10 more seconds to go.

605
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:28,500
You're almost there and five, four, three, two, and one.

606
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:37,600
Take a nice big, inhale to a count of 5 3 2 1 and then hold the lungs full for 10.

607
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,200
Eight.

608
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,300
Six.

609
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:50,400
42 and exhale for a count of five.

610
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,800
Three, One release.

611
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,500
One more time.

612
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,400
Inhale for a count of five.

613
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:20,500

614
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,800
I am just take whatever kind of breath feels good.

615
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,800
Now, at the end of this, I sometimes like to just take a big inhale and just sigh it out, right?

616
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,700
Just letting everything go and then, close your eyes with me for a moment.

617
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:43,900
And again, settle into sensation, settle into, whatever you're noticing in your body.

618
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:49,100
I often get tingling in my fingertips or get a little heated around my chest.

619
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,000
Take a moment just to observe.

620
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,000
To let your breathing go back to whatever its natural state is.

621
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:08,100
Feel what you feel without judgment without wondering if you did it right or wrong without thinking you could have done, it better.

622
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,100
Just noticing.

623
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,500
What is total radical acceptance of the year now?

624
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:28,900
And then in this sort of blissful post conscious mindful breathing moment.

625
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:35,500
I want to slip right into our two moments of gratitude and it's up to you can keep your eyes closed if you'd like or you can keep them open.

626
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:43,200
And what I want you to do is I want you to put one hand on your chest and one in back on your belly.

627
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:52,900
A nice can be closed if you wish and in this Blissful present State, this refreshed oxygenated plays we are together.

628
00:52:53,100 --> 00:53:03,700
I want you to take a moment to say thank you to express some gratitude to appreciate someone or something in your life.

629
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,400
Don't overthink it.

630
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,900
It might be the person that gave you the parking spot today.

631
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,700
You might be grateful for the weather.

632
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:30,000
You might be grateful for yourself that you showed up here to do this.

633
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,500
Whatever it is big or small.

634
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,700
Take a moment to recognize.

635
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:48,800
Two things people or situations for which you feel gratitude, and feel that gratitude as you acknowledge that.

636
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,200
Thank you for this beautiful day.

637
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Thank you for the air in my lungs.

638
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,400
Thank you.

639
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:08,000
For this moment, whatever it is, you can say it out loud, or you can say it in your head but say it and feel it.

640
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,800
And when you're ready, if your eyes are closed, you can go ahead and open them.

641
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:31,400
And if you have pen and paper, handy, go ahead and write down the two people or things for which you just express your gratitude.

642
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,000
Take a moment and write down what it is.

643
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,100
You're grateful for.

644
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,400
Why you are grateful?

645
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:50,400
And after we're done here today, you might even think about telling that person that you're thankful or taking a moment to express your gratitude in a more.

646
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:56,600
Public or direct kind of way optional bonus points.

647
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:04,100
And the final thing we're going to do is of the three, two, one R1 is Our Moment of power.

648
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,100
So a lot of us starter days off with the to-do list, right?

649
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,700
How, what do we got to do today?

650
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:16,100
I want to shift that and I want to focus on how we want to be how we want to feel.

651
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,800
I personally want to be in feel marvelous.

652
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,500
You may want to be or feel something different.

653
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,000
You might want to feel motivated.

654
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,600
You might want to feel peaceful.

655
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,200
You might want to feel capable focused, patient.

656
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,000
Whatever it is.

657
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:44,600
There's a beautiful truth Around The Power of Words and language and our ability to express how we feel and how we wish to feel or be, we don't spend enough time on that the average person.

658
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,600
If you ask them, how they are fine, right?

659
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,600
Or best case scenario of sad, happy angry.

660
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,400
That's it.

661
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,300
We can do better than that.

662
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,600
We can choose.

663
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:02,400
Not only how we want to feel and how we want to be, but we can choose the language that empowers us to actually embody that desired state.

664
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,800
So that's what this is about.

665
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,300
So I want you to take a moment.

666
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:10,100
Again, eyes closed or open and decide how you want.

667
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:16,600
It to feel for the rest of the state, how you want to feel At this moment and going forward for this day.

668
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,800
If you have pen and paper handy, go ahead and write that down.

669
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,100
You can also frame.

670
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,100
It could be either part 2 or different way to frame it.

671
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,100
Who do you want to be?

672
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,700
How do you want to show up?

673
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:41,200
And then between those two answers and might be the same answer, might be two different words.

674
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:49,300
I want you to choose the most specific encouraging, like the most magnetic word.

675
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,900
You can think of to describe that thinking power words, right?

676

00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,000
I don't want you to say, I want to feel sad today.

679
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,100

You can think of and write that down and say it to yourself because that's going to be your keyword, your Mantra, your like pavlovian symbol.

686
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:35,600
When you catch yourself out of that state, when you catch yourself feeling mat, if your desired state is, euphoric, you're going to do some of what we just did.

687
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,600
You're going to do a little a bit of breathing going to remind yourself of that word.

688

You're going to choose how you want to show up.

689
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,300
It's not what the Day brings that you bring to the day.

690
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:45,700
Okay.

691
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,000
So write down your power word, choose that word.

692
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,300
Burn it into your brain.

693
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,100
Keep it on your paper and your back pocket.

694
