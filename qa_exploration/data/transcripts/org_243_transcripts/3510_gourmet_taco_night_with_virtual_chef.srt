36
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,500
So each of you has received the kit.

37
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,800
If you open up your kit and your kid, I am sure most of you have already opened your kits, but that's my experience.

38
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,600
At least, is that up to this point?

39
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
Everyone opened it, they want to see what's in the box, and they have already organized it.

40
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,600
That's great.

41
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,600
We're going to go through all those pieces, but first, I want to have a drink with you.

42
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,300
So I am going to use a rocks glass.

43
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,600
I have my RTD that's a little assembly slang that we have right there.

44
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,200
That is a ready to drink.

45
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:40,600
Margarita from of you have non-alcoholic version, which is my favorite version, but they're all delicious.

46
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,100
I have some lime salt.

47
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,600
So you do have a package of lime salt.

48
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,700
There are two packages of salt in your kit this evening.

49
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,300
The lime salt is the one we're going to use first.

50
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,900
Then I like to use a little plate so that I can Rim, my rocks glass.

51
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,600
And then I am going to use a line here.

52
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,700
To complete this whole process.

53
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,400
I have gotten some Iced Out.

54
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,000
And now we're going to begin making a drink.

55
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,599
And then we're going to have a toast first.

56
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,700
Let us go ahead and dump that line Salt right on there.

57
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,800
Next, I am going to take a little bit of this line because I am going to use this line throughout the evening.

58
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,200
I am going to run my glass like this.

59
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:33,000
Now, I am going to take the moisture from the lime juice and I Rim the rim with, and I am going to put it through the lime salt.

60
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,300
So I have myself here, a nice, beautiful rimmed glass.

61
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:38,900
Now.

62
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,700
Remember, this is two drinks worth.

63
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:50,800
Although, I am not going to judge you for how you drink your drinks, but I am going to put some ice in a rocks, glass saved my limes, salt, for my next dream.

64
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,400
Finish this drink, the pour about half of this in here.

65
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,800
Save the other half for later on in my meal, maybe even for dessert.

66
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:10,200
And there we have our Margarita the ready to drink made famous by our restaurant here.

So while we have a drink in our hand, and we got our palate, nice and wet.

79
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,900
I am going to quickly, pull, pull a snack out so that we can munch on this snack.

Let us go ahead and let us pull out our bag of it says on there to topos which are our tips made of Masa, which is a corn flour that we grind every day from corn that we have sourced from different small farms in Mexico.

88

They come to us in the US.

89
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,500
Yes, we pay a premium for it.

90
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:54,300
That money goes right back into those small farms and in their communities, and then we have this delicious heirloom errant or Heritage corn that we see our process of mixed to Malaysian, which is a soaking calcifying process a little scientific.

91
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
It's pretty simple though, through that process.

92
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:03,800
We grind it into a corn flour, and then we make these chips, Ortho post, and I am going to pour those into a bowl.

93
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,800

00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,600
It's got about a 3 inside.

165
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,700
It's got about a 3-inch side here, and I am going to fill this is one thing.

166
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,100
I am going to use.

167
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:25,300
I am also going to use A saute pan here, or I am going to use a cast-iron.

168
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:37,700
I am going to use this to heat up our beef or arts or our excuse me, mushrooms, and then I have With me at the mall.

169
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,400
Now, you may not have one of these, that's fine.

170
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,600
We're going to do on that is we're going to heat up.

171
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,800
Our tacos.

172
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,700
Are for p as we're going to, like melt the cheese into the tortilla.

173
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So if you don't have a Kamal or a griddle top or something of that sort, just think about something that you might cook like eggs on or pancakes or bacon like a nonstick.

174
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,800
Something pretty large cause we're going to cook multiple Tacos on that.

175
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,600
At the same time.

176
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,900
I am going to cook, you know, two or four to time.

177
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,400
You could do.

178
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,200
Depending on the size of your pan, you can you all?

179
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,900
I ate it once, but you likely don't have a pan that big unless you have maybe a built-in flattop.

180
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,600
We will just do a couple of the time and it's going to be super fun and super easy.

181
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,400
All right.

182
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,600
So one more time, when I go through all of that, we have our chips and salsa.

183
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,100
We have our poor drink.

184
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,200
All right, we have all the ingredients in a bowl for being salad.

185
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,300
We have our platter Consul make up here.

186
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,800
We pulled out the ingredients for a tacos.

187
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:45,300
I have here one pan to heat up my Beef or mushroom one pot to heat up my broth.

188
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,600
And then I have my Surface in which I am going to continue to cook the tacos.

189
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,300
Now, if you don't have multiple pans, you can actually make one pan work.

190
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:01,200
It will take a couple extra steps of pulling the meat out, putting it into a container and then wiping that pan out, but that's totally fine.

191
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,900
If you want to kind of cut down on your dishes.

192
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,400
All right, so they're going to give everyone a few minutes to kind of In fact, going to a breakout room.

193
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,200
And from there, we're going to come back, and we're going to start cooking.

194
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,300
All right, so you will see a screen inviting you to your breakout room?

195
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,600
Just hit except and I will see you back here in about seven eight minutes.

196
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,700
All right, they all get out of here.

197
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,000
Do you have put me into the big homes?

198
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,300
Alrighty, welcome back.

199
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,100
I hope everyone was able to connect a little bit, the breakout rooms.

200
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,400
Enjoy your Margarita and have some of your to do post and your salsa.

201
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,700
Need a little bit of smokiness from that red salsa.

202
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,000
It's so delicious.

203
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,200
And you have tanginess from the Verde sauce.

204
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,300
It's in there as well.

205
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,700
Maybe forger, second drink.

206
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,300
I don't know.

207
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,500
Again, not here to clock your drinking, but if you have it.

208
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,300
Now might be a good time to do.

209
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,500
So, we're going to make this salad.

210
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,400
What I want to do with this salad, those I want to give it a little bit of a marination period?

211
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
So we're going to start the salad.

212
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,300
We're not going to finish it all the way yet.

213
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,200
We're going to let the beans marinate for a little bit as we heat up our tacos.

214
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,700
Okay.

215
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
So the first thing I want to do is I am going to take my mixing bowl.

216
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,100
I am going to take my beans and hominy and before the package right in the bowl.

217
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,800
Just like so, super simple.

218
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,300
Okay.

219
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,800
Next, I have some red onion here.

220
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:40,100
I am just going to slice thinly, right across the grain like this.

221
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,500
I like to use about.

222
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:52,900
Half of what you're probably had in your kit personally with this amount of being.

223
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,100
So, you see how I have very seen that ratio.

224
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,700
I am going to save this onion for some stock or something.

225
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:08,800
Alright, next, I am going to take our Tomatoes these Rebel Tomatoes.

226
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,900
It comes from Marfa, Texas, and I am just going to cut the bigger ones in like third recorders.

227
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,000
Maybe the smaller ones and just halves like.

228
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,500
So we have some nice, Red Onion.

229
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,300
Excuse me.

230
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,500
You do have the red onion.

231
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,900
You also have some nice, red, tomatoes, and yellow tomatoes.

232
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,400
Some are sweeter than the other.

233
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,800
The yellow tends to be more.

234
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,900
Heart, right.

235
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,300
I am just going to start to give that a toss.

236
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,400
Next, I am going to take so you should have most of your line left.

237
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,700
You take a bit of that.

238
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,700
Give this some lime juice.

239
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,100
This is going to help the marination process.

240
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,100
I am going to take some of my mulled own salt.

241
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,800
You may not have open that package up yet.

242
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,200
That is the other package of salt.

243
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,800
You have.

244
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,700
I am going to season my salad a bit.

245
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,400
Now.

246
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,900
There has been some seasoning added.

247
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,700
So we're just adding a touch more really to taste.

248
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,400
I just have a pinch and I season from hi.

249
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:13,600
All right, so it gets nice and Incorporated, and then we take about two-thirds of my Paseo oil.

250
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,300
I am going to put it right on there.

251
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:22,800
I am only going to use two-thirds of it or so because I am going to use the rest of it to garnish when that time comes.

252
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,400
I have a kitchen spoon, give this a nice stir.

253
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,900
So what's happening?

254
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,700
Is that Smoky plescia.

255
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,700
All right, which is the Smoky lockable pepper.

256
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,900
The Red, Onion, the black beans, and the harmony.

257
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,400
With those Tomatoes, the salt, the lime are going to marinate and really impart a bunch of flavor.

258
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,600
Just going to put that aside.

259
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:59,600
I do have my herbs and my queso fresco and rest assured if you have a base hit York as a fresco is also plant-based.

260
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:06,300
We're just going to save that for when we plate our salad.

261
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,800
Okay.

262
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,400
It's just going to marinate for a bit.

263
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:15,000
— I would put my bowl back on my side, put the spoon and its place.

264
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,800
And now we're going to start cooking.

265
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,100
All right, step 1.

266
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,300
Let us take our beef broth, or you may have a mushroom broth.

267
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,600
Let us pour that into our sauce pot.

268
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,900
We nice and thick.

269
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:36,300
There's some good viscous bone broth in there.

270
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,100
You have the short rib broth.

271
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,700
Well, I am going to turn my burner on.

272
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:47,000
I am going to put that at about a medium-high heat, and we're going to let that heat up till it gets to about a simmer.

273
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:48,900
Now.

274
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,100
I am going to take my cast-iron pan.

275
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,900
I am going to put that on a low heat.

276
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,200
I have already done so personally so you go ahead and do that.

277
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,800
Put on a low heat.

278
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,100
We're just going to use this to heat.

279
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,400
Up our, our beef have that on a low heat.

280
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:04,700
Now.

281
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:16,600
I have my coma which I sorry about earlier or my flat top cooking surface here, which I am going to heat my tortillas and sort of do the finishing of my tacos on now.

282
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,100
This works very well-to-do multiple tacos.

283
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,000
If you do not have something like this cool.

284
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,500
We will get through.

285
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,600
It will use something else.

286
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,700
I do encourage you to buy one though.

287
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,900
If you cook often, it's great for bacon pancakes.

288
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,400
All To do eggs on it like to fry potatoes on it.

289
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,300
They usually on the other side have like a griddle, like a grill marks, you can grill fish on it.

290
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:43,000
So I am going to sort anyway, if you don't have any like this, a large pan, that you would cook Crepes or pancakes anything like that.

291
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And we will work like a big non-stick pan works really?

292
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,300
Well.

293
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,500
This is cast iron.

294
00:41:47,500 --> 00:42:00,000
It's nice and seasoned, but I am going to like take a little bit of my neutral oil and just give it another little seasoning oil so that when that time comes, I was ready to go.

295
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,200
So this is already on a low, to medium Heat.

296
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,800
I am just letting that heat up and get ready.

297
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:17,100
When the time comes we're going to turn the heat up a little bit more to a low medium to like a medium to medium-high, but for now, it's just heating slowly.

298
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,600
This pan is heating slowly.

299
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,200
My stock on my Quantum, an is heating slowly.

300
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:28,700
I am gonna check the chat and make sure that I am not missing any questions if we can go over to the chat.

301
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:33,900
Most Wanted.

302
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:39,800
Awesome.

303
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,000
I see a big dog.

304
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,100
Well as a cute dog.

305
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,500
All right.

306
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,100
It doesn't look like we have any real questions about the food.

307
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,700
So that's great.

308
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,400
But I do love that.

309
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,800
You're sharing your hearing your photos, showing your dog picks.

310
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,800
There's your canine sous-chef if you will.

311
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,900
Okay, so we have that on going up there.

312
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,000
Any questions, please, ask them now.

313
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,900
Next.

314
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:09,600
I am going to open up my short rib video.

315
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,400
And what I am doing is I am giving this three nice cuss like this, and I have kind of opened it.

316
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,100
Just opens up like a book.

317
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,600
So I am going to use this packaging to help you.

318
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,700
If you have the mushroom.

319
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,200
You cannot really do that with the mushroom.

320
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,800
Just give it one cut, but if you do have a short rib, this is a great way to do that.

321
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,800
Kind of put it aside.

322
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,000
We're not going to use it quite yet.

323
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:51,400
I have my guess, you know, that Oaxaca oaxacan to co which is made by hand from a family Oaxaca that makes us this cheese, and we get it at all of our restaurants a couple times a week.

324
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,700
It is amazing.

325
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,600
It is delicious.

326
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,000
Look how much that breaks up.

327
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,800
I would give it a little bite just to taste it.

328
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,400
It's creamy.

329
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:11,100
It's tart or Tonight, it's a rich and cheesy and also like that perfect amount of like funky cheese taster.

330
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,200
I am going to put that there and I will give up that are a little bit.

331
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,900
I am going to open up my white onion.

332
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:21,900
All right.

333
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,300
This is going to be to garnish our Taco.

334
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:33,500
So, often a street Taco, this video Taco sometimes like it's Aqua past or like a good carne asada.

335
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:49,600
You will see like a typical accompaniment or Darkness to that will be cilantro or, and lime wedges and diced up onion, white onion.

336
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,200
And so, we're going to prepare that typical.

337
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,100
Mint right now, so I have the cilantro.

338
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,200
It's already picked for you.

339
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,800
So we're not really have to do anything with that.

340
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,200
Besides things on the package.

341
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,800
We have the line we're going to make lime wedges shortly.

342
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:15,000
And then I am just going to give this a nice Dice and I like to do a small dice because I don't want to bite into too much onion.

343
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:15,900
Okay?

344
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,600
And again, I am going to use about half of what I have here and save the rest of this onion for a nice stock layer.

345
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,300
And that's what I am going to use.

346
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,200
Now, depending on what your tastes are, what your flavor profiles.

347
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,700
You love is.

348
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,500
You may want to be more.

349
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:39,900
You may want to do less, totally cool, Choose Your Own Adventure and that one, go ahead and open up my cilantro.

350
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:47,700
All right, and let us keep this lime and give ourselves some wedges.

351
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,500
Well, I just do a little wedge, maybe one wedge for every couple tacos or Doom, really small.

352
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,700
I am going to put that aside.

353
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,700
So basically this is going to be our garnish and that time comes.

354
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,100
All right.

355
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:06,200
Bye.

356
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,000
Now, pot is hot.

357
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:20,600
Looks like my consomme or my beef stock, or maybe a mushroom stock is heating up nicely that congealed Ridge.

358
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,800
Bone marrow in there as it's often doubt.

359
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,700
Give it a little taste of this.

360
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,500
Very delicious.

361
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,400
It's nice and hot which is how we want it.

362
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:41,600
So we're going to put that down to a low heat and then I have my Kamal heating up Now's the Time when I am probably going to put that on a medium heat because we're going to cook on that.

363
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,200
All right, I am gonna take about 5 Seconds, 10 seconds.

364
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,200
Check the chat.

365
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,900
Make sure there are no questions.

366
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:59,600
Make sure that everyone has confirmed that everyone has hot heating cooking vessels on their stove because once we get going, we got to go pretty fast.

367
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,500
I don't want anyone to fall behind.

368
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,000
All right.

369
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:05,900
Cool.

370
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,500
Good evening.

371
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,400
I am glad Pieces.

372
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,000
Good.

373
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,800
Yes, the cheese is so goofs.

374
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,000
Pete agrees.

375
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:18,500
We can good.

376
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,400
All right, looks like we're ready.

377
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,200
So, enjoy and chips and salsa.

378
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,600
Yeah, you can have you seen that mean?

379
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,900
It's like, what do I do?

380
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,200
Do I just keep beating them or do I die, right?

381
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,800
That's how I feel like substance also to cool down my plate.

382
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,400
We're ready.

383
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,200
I feel good.

384
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:34,900
You feel good.

385
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,100
Yes, yes.

386
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:47,300
Alright if you have just the regular traditional kit with the beauty of short rib tacos, we're going to do a little bit of oil in the pan.

387
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,900
If you have the mushroom kit, you will want a bit more oil because it is more liquidy.

388
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,900
Whereas the beef is more fatty.

389
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,600
I am going to open up the flip that down like that.

390
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,800
Remember, this is all compostable packaging that goes into my compost.

391
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,500
Now, this short rib and as well as the mushrooms fully cooked.

392
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,800
So we're really kind of just heating this up.

393
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,800
We're not really, we're not, we're not looking to get a sear.

394
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,900
Let me a little bit of a Sears, always great because it imparts some texture and flavor.

395
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,100
But this is cooked.

396
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:30,200
We want this heated up enough, to be able to break it up into are eight different top of.

397
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,900
Remember, this is enough for a taco.

398
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:37,200
So keep that in mind as you're building the tacos, now, there may be some pieces of the body.

399
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:37,900
Short rib.

400
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:43,400
That is, you know, that fattiness really just needs to be broken up with a spoon or spatula.

401
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,100
Go ahead and do that.

402
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,600
Now, a pair of tongs will work.

403
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:56,400
Right, let us just break that all up now, so that we go to build the tacos, ready to go.

404
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:58,700
Okay.

405
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,600
Now I am going to turn my heat off because I am hot, that's all it took.

406
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,400
If you see here, Mike, Lonesome a, let us come to a full boil.

407
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,800
I do not want it that hot because inevitably, I am gonna stick my fingers in it, and I am gonna burn myself.

408
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,700
So let us turn it down.

409
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,800
Hot me or if you have mushrooms?

410
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,300
It should look about the same hot stock.

411
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,300
I have my hot Kamal from now.

412
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,600
I have my tortillas right here.

413
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,700
I brought the cheese over.

414
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,700
And we're going to start building tacos, you already.

415
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:47,900
Okay, as you do have we seen the video Taco on the internet, the Instagram sensation or tick-tock?

416
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,600
Yes, doc.

417
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,300
We have seen it.

418
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,200
Oh, I see what you're saying about talking to me.

419
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:55,700
That's fine.

420
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,700
Yes, but he had tacos.

421
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,200
I will give you a little background.

422
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:08,000
We go in the big breakout rooms of where but it came from traditionally, but now this internet sensation is like this.

423
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Ew, e, gooey Taco.

424
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,200
You dip it in the sauce.

425
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,200
You needed some food trucks all over Austin.

426
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:17,200
I don't have my blessing country because you haven't been traveled as much as normal, right?

427
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,100
But they're delicious.

428
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,500
They're made with here.

429
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,300
They're going to maybe be made with these delicious scones with you.

430
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,200
Is that we grind.

431
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,600
Yeah, super, super stoked, okay.

432
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
I am going to take one tortilla.

433
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,600
Just going to let me I would be counterintuitive to some of y'all.

434
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,300
I am a dip it into my consomme.

435
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:48,300
This is one of the reasons that it's important to have a seasoning or a fat on your cooking surface because when we put this 40 on the cooking surface, we don't want it to stick.

436
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,100
See what it's doing right there.

437
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,900
That's great.

438
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,400
That's perfect.

439
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,300
That's what we want.

440
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,600
I am going to do for tacos to start.

441
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:06,100
Again, we have give me enough for eight depending on how hungry you are, or who you have there with you, you can decide how many to cook.

442
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,400
Want to make sure?

443
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,400
Free and then let us go with the fourth one.

444
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,500
Okay.

445
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:24,500
Now I am going to go back to my first one because it is now ready for slip.

446
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,200
We hope that we have enough fat so that it doesn't stick you see.

447
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,000
I have a little sticky notes here, but that's okay.

448
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,400
I am gonna use.

449
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,200
Well today.

450
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,800
I am going to use the spoon but if you have a spatula you can use that too.

451
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,400
Get up off.

452
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,900
Give it a nice flip.

453
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,200
I am going to find a spatula real quick.

454
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,800
You should as well.

455
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,400
And you give the second one, the flip.

456
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,700
Again.

457
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,900
This is why it's important to have a decent amount of fat on your pan.

458
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:04,800
But if you have a little bit of a rip like I do, I am going to show you an incredible way to incredibly delicious way to fix it.

459
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,500
Even some of you may already know what I am going to do a tour to fix it.

460
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,100
All right, and I am going to give this next flip on the last one.

461
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,800
Like so cool.

462
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,600
These look great.

463
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,800
I am totally cool with this little bit of a rip here.

464
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,600
I am just going to throw some cheese over it.

465
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,300
Remember, this is enough cheese for ate tacos.

466
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:34,500
I know you're going to want to put so much of this delicious cheese on there.

467
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,500
But a little goes a really long way.

468
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,900
And if you have the Basically, you do have a plant-based cheese.

469
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,500
Alright, so we have now our meat.

470
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:53,100
Okay, when you put that right over the cheese again, this is enough for eight.

471
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,500
So each one is just a little bit of really rich meat and really rich cheese, okay.

472
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,400
I have another four tacos ready to go.

473
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,600
I have my mean I have my cheese on my garnish.

474
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,500
Ready, will take this spatula.

475
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:23,400
I am going to go ahead and fold my first Taco like, so again for my full my second Taco, like, so and you see right where I have that.

476
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:23,800
Rip.

477
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,900
No Freddie.

478
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,200
No worries.

479
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,000
I tacos are coming together.

480
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,000
This is not one of those like super.

481
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,200
This is, I mean, it is beautiful.

482
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,400
It's delicious.

483
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,000
It's not one of those super like high-touch fancy meal things right?

484
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,200
We're just making some delicious food.

485
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:48,400
Here are making sure that cheese is not kind of binding that taco down, and then we take some more of that consomme.

486
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,800
I am just going to put it over my tacos.

487
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,800
I want to keep that taco.

488
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,000
Nice and gooey.

489
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,300
Right.

490
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,000
Look at that.

491
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,500
And you see the heat is just making that evaporate.

492
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,900
You got the cheese coming off the side.

493
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,900
That's exactly what we're looking for.

494
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,100
Let that cook for another minute.

495
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,500
Even split.

496
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,700
Give a flip.

497
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,200
Another flip.

498
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,500
You got crispy cheese.

499
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:24,900
There we go.

500
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,200
I am going to start with my next tortilla.

501
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,400
So I can do four more.

502
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,700
Put these tacos up to the side of us.

503
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,200
Lower heat side of my Kamal.

504
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,800
Make sure have some more fat down there because I didn't have enough to begin with.

505
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:51,300
If you remember, that's fine, less and learn can always fix that.

506
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,400
Take my soaps for Kia.

507
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,800
Remember this consomme we're going to end up using it as our dip.

508
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,400
All right.

509
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,600
All right, we're going to pull that first few tacos off.

510
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:19,500
They're going to stay nice and hot and start putting them on my plate.

511
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,100
Like so.

512
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,000
The first one here.

513
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,000
I told you this part.

514
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,900
We're going to start moving a little bit fast.

515
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,000
But again, we're just making tacos.

516
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,800
This is fun.

517
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:46,200
This is not rocket science or super fancy food.

518
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,000
This is delicious and miliar.

519
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,100
Homey style Homestyle food.

520
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:57,400
All right.

521
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,900
Where to go Keys down on that?

522
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,000
First one, I flipped.

523
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,900
Put into that meat in there.

524
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,300
Go to the next split.

525
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,900
So let us get a little bit of color on it.

526
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,400
Like a little caramelization.

527
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,500
That's great.

528
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,400
We want that.

529
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,000
Please rest a cheese for the last few tacos.

530
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,700
Make sure evenly.

531
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,400
Throw s***.

532
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:45,000
A couple tacos in the meat.

533
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,400
Or mushrooms.

534
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,900
Now, I will get let you in on a little secret.

535
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,700
I actually this means great.

536
00:56:54,700 --> 00:57:06,800
This is from a local Rancher here in Texas, high quality delicious free-range beef and I just, I love eating it.

537
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,000
I have no, you know, have no aversions to meat or beef.

538
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,700
But this kit, I actually prefer the mushrooms are so good.

539
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:18,400
So if you ever offered an opportunity to eat, Mushrooms in this way.

540
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,800
I highly recommend it.

541
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,600
I give a little fold here.

542
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,700
The fold on my next taco.

543
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:32,100
And then my last fold, I am going to let that cook for a minute.

544
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:40,700
It unfolds, go ahead and come back and just kind of force it uses that cheese to help find it.

545
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,800
Okay, see that perfect.

546
00:57:51,700 --> 00:58:03,500
I give it one more spoonful of consomme like so, Make sure that these are nice and gooey.

547
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:10,200
It's almost like, you know, into ladas aren't super common in Mexico.

548
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,900
And the way that you see them in the u.s.

549
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,700
You're more actually more like this.

550
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,300
We just have a fold over a little bit of sauce and some filling.

551
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,900
Okay, cool.

552
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,400
All those last few cooks.

553
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,700
Let us go ahead and finish our bean salad because this will just take a minute.

554
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:33,000
We have that marinated Bean that's going to go straight into the bowl.

555
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:45,900
We have some of our honey do queso fresco, which is a local cheese will go to Austin.

556
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,500
We have our fresh herbs here.

557
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,300
Let us hear some of them up there.

558
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,000
Different herbs in here and there might be some frilly mustard.

559
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,000
You might have some amaranths wood.

560
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,200
Sorrel, even all these are grown just for us at our farm.

561
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,000
Okay.

562
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:13,100
What Charleston, dianthus Leaf Samara gold leaf, and then we just want that to look really beautiful to take a little bit more of that Paseo oil.

563
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:16,000
We had just finish it.

564
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:25,000
This number, that's a fully compostable bag.

565
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,300
And that is finished, and we go back to wear the clothes.

566
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,100
They did great and turn all the heat off on my stove.

567
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:37,400
Now.

568
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,600
I am going to finish building out my taco platter here.

569
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:43,400
Look at that.

570
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,600
Nice crispy side Bowie.

571
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:57,900
Let us just Yes, I am right.

572
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:03,800
And she's here, and I am going to take you as my consomme looking for it, right in?

573
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:12,100
Think of if you want to compare to something think of like an Azu sandwich, right?

574
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,200
Where you take your sandwich and take a bite and dip it in your broth.

575
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,500
Take these onions.

576
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,900
So she long throw?

577
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,600
How to fold the tacos?

578
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,800
Now, you can't really you're right.

579
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,100
Danielle mess up a taco too poorly.

580
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,300
How to fold the taco.

581
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,600
I just, you know, I use the tongs it's bad.

582
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:48,400
So I am sure we're past that point now, but I just saw that in the top here.

583
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,700
I have some lime wedges.

584
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,800
Take the rest of this onion.

585
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,500
All right, we have it.

586
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,200
Like so.

587
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:12,400
Even a little bit into the consummate is how I prefer that, because some of that onion flavor, starts to come out, oil starts to come out like that.

588
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,500
And there we have it.

589
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,100
The Vessel Margarita, we have already eaten our chips and salsa.

590
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,600
You probably you may have drank and had a drink of all your Margarita by now, too.

591
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,600
How does that look for y'all?

592
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:31,100
I know.

593
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:33,700
Are you enjoying it?

594
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:34,200
Are we?

595
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:35,900
All right.

596
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,800
I would love to have a first bite with you.

597
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:43,500
But I want to make sure that everyone catches up who everyone who's cooking tonight.

598
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,400
And if you're not cooking tonight, and you do have your kit rest assured.

599
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,300
There are instructions in the kit are super clear.

600
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,700
You have a little bit of some structural video on our part.

601
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,800
And so now you have a good idea of how it's supposed to go.

602
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,300
And yeah, you can just follow those instructions, but I am gonna go ahead and have this first bite.

603
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,200
So I like to use like to grab the taco.

604
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:10,000
Okay, I have some lime, make sure I have some of that cilantro on there, some of those onions.

605
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,900
And I am going to dip it into that consomme.

606
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:13,700
Get that.

607
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,900
This is a little messy.

608
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,500
That's okay.

609
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,500
This is how we do it.

610
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:28,700
That's so delicious.

611
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:30,700
What do y'all think?

612
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,100
Is he one having a bite yet?

613
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,900
Yes, you can drag and drop a picture into the text.

614
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,800
I am gonna go have a bite of my bean salad.

615
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,300
Now sometimes a bean salad may seem kind of boring, but I show you.

616
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,000
This means I was really delicious.

617
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,500
I encourage you to have a bite now.

618
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,200
What do y'all think?

619
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:19,600
Danielle.

620
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,800
Did you do delete all your tacos?

621
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,600
I sure hope not.

622
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,000
I hope they left some for you.

623
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:32,900
Awesome.

624
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:45,000
So I assume there're any questions because everyone's still cooking when I hope that everyone's having a great experience with the cooking or you're eating and enjoying it so much.

625
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:50,300
What I would like to do is know if there's no more.

626
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,800
No more instructional questions.

627
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,400
Let us go into these breakout rooms to have a taco party.

628
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,000
And I would love to come in and out of those rooms and check in.

629
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:05,900
And you all, maybe tell you a little bit of story of how this came about, maybe share a chocolate with you, because, you know, I am ready for dinner as well.

630
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,400
All right, now to go into the breakout rooms, you're going to have a little prompt.

631
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,700
On your screen will say join.

632
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,000
Join the taco party.

633
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,000
Go ahead and click on that and join that taco party.

634
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,900
Yeah, I think that's how they want to do.

635
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:36,800
She knows.

636
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:46,500
Booster, you know, stuck out.

637
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,100
She knows that guy.

638
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:57,400
Does he ever belong here?

639
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,900
Baby, I omentum and no doubt.

640
01:07:44,900 --> 01:08:02,500
Cuando me outside your so don't chose a Bulgari.

641
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,000
Not by your the what I do anymore.

642
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:30,600
Is he do my dear to permit, the September of daughter?

643
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,600
I am using gonna look into a mirror.

644
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:31,700
I am 42 years old, but that is impressive.

645
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:34,300
She knows what's coming.

646
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,000
You know, Stackhouse.

647
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:51,900
She knows that guy that she ever belong here.

648
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:44,700
McConnell owner of bouldin food Forest, sustainable Farm in Rogers, Texas, we grow primarily Greens on here, 2016 started, Urban farming in South Austin, and I wanted to have more land because gardening was a hobby that got out of control.

649
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,200
So we practice permaculture principles out here.

650
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:56,000
The way you can Define permaculture is that get is a way to design an ecosystem that is beneficial to plan.

651
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,400
Since oil.

652
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:03,100
And humans, one of our primary missions is to lead the land in better shape than when we found it.

653
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,000
A lot of farmers.

654
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,800
Don't practice that we have these tunnels.

655
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,100
We have hundred-foot tunnels.

656
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:11,600
We have five of them on our farm right now, and they are great.

657
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:16,200
Protectors from extreme weather star Greenhouse.

658
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:25,100
And then we transplant by hand, all of these letters, heads that we have grown in our Greenhouse from seed.

659
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,500
So, everything we grow here, we have grown ourselves.

660
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,200
I love, love, love growing lettuce.

661
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:42,900
Well, you'd be enjoying at your event or lettuce is from this bed and most likely this bed for the folks who are going to be part of this event.

662
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,100
I think you're going to really like this lettuce.

663
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:53,300
One of the things that I really love about Austin is how food-centric it is.

664
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:57,900
So many great restaurants in Austin by local farms.

665
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,900
There's a really nice healthy diversity of farms.

666
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:09,800
And that wouldn't exist if restaurants and school districts, grocery stores, weren't supporting those local farms.

667
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:16,200
The more you keep your money local, the more you're growing, the economy in the You're growing the future health of your own community.

668
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:19,500
And that's its great to see often.

669
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,200
Not only talk that talk.

670
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:21,800
That really walk.

671
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,400
That walk.

672
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:29,500
Awesome.

673
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:34,300
Well, I hope that you have all had a great experience.

674
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:39,100
I know some of you may come from the breakout rooms, and he may be cooking still in front of making into your room.

675
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:39,700
I am sorry.

676
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:41,800
I am here.

677
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,400
Now for any quick questions.

678
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,800
You may have or anything that goes into the chat.

679
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,700
I would be happy to answer.

680
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:53,000
And if we rather just enjoy your food, put your, put your kids to bed.

681
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,400
Totally great.

682
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,300
But I hope you were able to pay attention that last video.

683
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:03,900
One thing that makes what we do, I think so special is that we are fully committed to using.

684
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:13,400
You know, obviously I said over and over again Nico packet and go friendly packaging and you have some literature in your box about what that Eco packet, eco-friendly Packaging.

685
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:23,100
Entails, but we also Source locally everything we Source other than the things that we get from Mexico, which one we get two things from actually make sure that we're all so.

686
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:28,700
Thoughtfully sourcing getting organic making sure that our dollars are going back into communities.

687
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:33,300
That better those communities and it's very, very important to us.

688
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:56,000
But also when we do Source locally, which is probably the other 70% of what we have, it's always, you know, thoughtfully grown in a thirty to sixty mile, radius of the front door of assembly from the beef to if you have any of our kids that have seafood, we get everything from the Gulf from day boat, Fisher's, as well as all the produce is grown locally.

689
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,200
Obviously, if you have a kid that has pineapple in it, we do that.

690
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:07,200
Sometimes we don't get the pineapples locally, but for the most part like again, it's always thoughtful practicing?

691
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:11,900
Or make sure way we are getting those products is somewhere that we know.

692
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,600
We're not only in the best product of Using the best practices.

693
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:18,700
Awesome.

694
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:19,800
Yes.
