00:16:46,502 --> 00:16:48,102
Hello everyone.

2
00:16:48,102 --> 00:16:53,702
It's so great to see you all happy August First Tuesday of the month.

3
00:16:53,702 --> 00:17:07,602
I am Gina head of marketing of welcome, and we are happy to be with you today to talk about a very, very important topic on getting effective and communicating feedback before.

4
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:10,402
We jump into our panel topic discussion.

5
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:15,102
We have got folks tuning in from Helena Montana, that's where Claire's at Janet.

6
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:16,102
Hello from Mendocino.

7
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,102
Now to Pennsylvania Dallas, Texas.

8
00:17:19,102 --> 00:17:20,002
San Diego.

9
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:22,402
It's so great to have you all here.

10
00:17:22,402 --> 00:17:23,902
I am doing it from Las Vegas.

11
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:25,702
All right.

12
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:31,802
So today we have got some, some questions that were submitted in advance.

13
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:40,702
So, feel free to go to the Q&A tab to the right and check out the questions that were submitted, feel free to upvote them.

14
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:45,302
And at any given time through this event, drop your questions.

15
00:17:45,302 --> 00:17:53,502
If you have any Cuz we're going to pull those on stage and Claire and I are going to have this Rich dialogue around the feedback, and we can answer them real time now.

16
00:17:53,502 --> 00:18:02,302
Employ feedback surfaces issues in the workplace which we all know can improve morale retention and feelings of safety.

17
00:18:02,802 --> 00:18:10,302
But the problem is there're barriers to giving feedback like fear of retaliation or fear of not being believed.

18
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:16,002
So in order to create a thriving, engaging work culture, it's critical.

19
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:18,402
To hear from your employees about what's going.

20
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:19,902
Well, what's not?

21
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:24,102
And then here's the kicker, take the action to fix it.

22
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:25,902
So I am so excited.

23
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:29,502
It's one of my favorite topics because I need to learn a lot from it as well.

24
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:32,902
But I am so excited for this opportunity to chat with Claire.

25
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:39,102
She's the founder and CEO of all voices and employee feedback management platform.

26
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:56,602
We're going to hear a little bit more about that when she comes on stage and you know, on March 20 21 all voices survey Paid 800 plus individuals from the US who are fully employed and ask them about the free feedback programs at their workplace and check this out.

27
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:02,902
79 percent of employees have shared feedback with their employer.

28
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:10,102
41% have left a job because they didn't feel listened to 37 percent.

29
00:19:10,102 --> 00:19:12,102
Have left the job because they felt feedback.

30
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:13,202
Was it being taken?

31
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:22,502
Seriously, in the workplace and said, Four percent would be more inclined to share feedback if it's truly Anonymous.

32
00:19:23,002 --> 00:19:30,502
So those are some real staggering statistics there, and I am looking forward to unpacking that a little bit more.

33
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,402
Thanks, Katie.

34
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:33,502
She's the producer right now in The Green Room.

35
00:19:33,502 --> 00:19:34,202
Hello?

36
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:35,902
Y'all feel free to say hi to her.

37
00:19:35,902 --> 00:19:40,702
Thanks for dropping that guide that all voices just put out.

38
00:19:40,902 --> 00:19:42,502
So we're going to kick off with this pole.

39
00:19:42,502 --> 00:19:44,002
We have got two poles.

40
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:48,502
The first question at your company.

41
00:19:49,102 --> 00:19:51,002
How comfortable do you think?

42
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:52,902
Employees are giving leadership.

43
00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:54,702
Positive feedback.

44
00:19:55,302 --> 00:19:57,502
Feel free to drop your votes right now.

45
00:19:58,902 --> 00:20:01,002
And then we're going to ask the flip side of it.

46
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,802
Very comfortable.

47
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,602
Oh, that's good to see somewhat comfortable.

48
00:20:06,902 --> 00:20:09,102
We got a fairly uncomfortable, extremely uncomfortable.

49
00:20:09,102 --> 00:20:13,702
Okay, we have got make sense, very uncomfortable.

50
00:20:13,702 --> 00:20:17,002
All right, next question at your company.

51
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:19,602
How comfortable do you think?

52
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:23,302
Employees are giving leadership negative feedback?

53
00:20:24,302 --> 00:20:25,602
Go ahead and drop your votes.

54
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:31,502
All right.

55
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:35,402
Okay, I am not fully seeing the votes.

56
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,002
There they are.

57
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,202
They're coming through.

58
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:46,402
All right, somewhat comfortable, 35% fairly uncomfortable, 35% and then 25%, extremely uncomfortable.

59
00:20:46,602 --> 00:20:47,102
All right.

60
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:52,502
So this probably isn't surprising to Claire.

61
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,802
I would love for you to join me on the stage.

62
00:20:57,702 --> 00:20:58,902
Hello.

63
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,502
Hello, it's great to be here.

64
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:04,602
Thanks for having me.

65
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,202
Absolutely.

66
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:16,102
Yeah it's great to see you, and I am so excited to have this conversation with you around feedback and really tap into your expertise.

67
00:21:16,602 --> 00:21:21,902
Can you tell us a little bit about all voices and even if you have any thoughts on that pole?

68
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:24,402
Yeah that pole was really interesting.

69
00:21:24,602 --> 00:21:30,302
I will share my thoughts in a second but first all voices, like Gina men.

70
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:34,202
And is an employee feedback management platform.

71
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:39,502
And what that really means is that we help employees speak up about anything.

72
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:46,502
They want to at work positive negative neutral in real time, and we have built a two-way Communication channel.

73
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:50,702
So that HR leaders legal leaders, CEOs.

74
00:21:50,702 --> 00:22:06,302
Anyone in the leadership role is able to have a back and forth conversation with that employee, and then we provide a bunch of tools on the back end for the Teachers to help them take action, understand, patterns, and Trends, and ultimately resolve.

75
00:22:06,302 --> 00:22:08,702
The things that are being brought up in one way or another.

76
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,502
So it's been a really fascinating Journey.

77
00:22:12,502 --> 00:22:18,702
We have been doing it for five years and I think just to touch back on those poll results.

78
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:52,502
One thing that's really interesting to me when I started all voices, it was really in response to the me to movement, that was emerging and my hypothesis was that Would be extremely hesitant to speak up at work, about really serious issues, like sexual harassment, discrimination mistreatment, and what we found in the first, like, six months was that employees were using our platform to share all kinds of feedback positive negative anywhere in between a lot of questions, actually.

79
00:22:52,902 --> 00:23:00,302
So what we realized was for one reason or another many employees have hesitations about speaking up about anything.

80
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:21,902
I am at work and so making sure that you have some way for them to speak up anonymously, which goes back to that statistic, Gina that you shared about employees, wanting and preferring to have an option at least for anonymous feedback, that was really one of the things that I took away from the first six months is, like, no matter what's going on with an employee.

81
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:26,002
It's good for them to have multiple different channels to share that feedback.

82
00:23:26,302 --> 00:23:30,302
Hmm, ii-i'd love to tap into that more.

83
00:23:30,802 --> 00:23:34,502
I know we have some other questions going to, but like what are all those channels?

84
00:23:34,502 --> 00:23:37,602
Like if we can get into that later on, that would be great.

85
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:39,702
What I would like to kick it off?

86
00:23:39,702 --> 00:23:42,902
First with a question that came through.

87
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:48,902
How would you define good versus bad feedback?

88
00:23:48,902 --> 00:23:53,002
And I think we can start with the ladder on bad feedback.

89
00:23:53,202 --> 00:24:02,302
I know Claire when you are you and I were chatting earlier, there's probably a lot more bad behavior that occurs around this in a workplace.

90
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:03,202
What are your thoughts?

91
00:24:05,102 --> 00:24:12,002
Yeah, I mean I think look having a company is just challenging, right?

92
00:24:12,002 --> 00:24:27,002
And I started a company and I have seen this firsthand, but you're bringing together a big group of people who all come from different backgrounds, have different experiences, have different communication Styles, you're bringing them all together, whether they're remote, or they're all in the same room.

93
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:33,702
And you're saying like, Okay, let us all work together toward the shared goal, there are always going to be conflict.

94
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:35,802
They're always going to be miscommunication.

95
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:40,302
There are always going to be challenges personality clashes Etc, right?

96
00:24:40,302 --> 00:24:56,802
There's no like perfect company culture or Utopia and so the question in my mind is how do you make it possible for employees to speak up about what's going on about what their reality is early and often?

97
00:24:56,802 --> 00:25:03,602
And if you do that, what you will find is that you have the information that you need to take.

98
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,902
Action to make things better, right?

99
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:13,402
You so in terms of like bad behavior versus good behavior, bad feedback versus good feedback.

100
00:25:13,602 --> 00:25:26,902
I would say in general, it's just about needing to first, to sort of start with listening and understanding what's going on and making sure that people actually feel safe speaking up.

101
00:25:27,802 --> 00:25:33,302
And like I said, even if let us say your company is perfect, let us say it's this dream company.

102
00:25:33,302 --> 00:25:33,602
Where everyone?

103
00:25:33,802 --> 00:25:36,602
Everyone feels 100% comfortable being transparent.

104
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:45,202
Being honest, you're still going to have issues come up and people come to your company with baggage from their previous rules.

105
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:55,202
And so even if you as an HR leader are incredibly approachable, and you have built relationships with every person, they're still probably a lot.

106
00:25:55,202 --> 00:25:57,902
That is not being brought to you for one reason or another.

107
00:25:57,902 --> 00:26:10,702
So I think of all voices, as kind of like The Back-up Plan, like In case someone's not comfortable coming to, you just have another way that they can speak up, just to make sure you have all your bases covered.

108
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,102
Mmm, that's good.

109
00:26:13,402 --> 00:26:13,902
That's good.

110
00:26:13,902 --> 00:26:41,902
So, when you know, you were mentioning something about how bad behavior has been part of companies for a long time and, you know, it's been a broken system that a lot of us are used to operating within where the proper channels aren't in place and Managers may not have the training knowing how to have a constructive conversation around feedback with their employees.

111
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:44,902
So what are your thoughts to this?

112
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:48,402
And you know what, what does that look like for?

113
00:26:48,402 --> 00:26:57,902
And I think this goes into the next highest voted question is, you know, what is the best way to provide constructive feedback to your leader to your employee?

114
00:26:57,902 --> 00:26:59,002
This goes both ways.

115
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:14,702
Yeah, so when I was doing research to into this space right into employee reporting an employee feedback and how historically employees have spoken up at work.

116
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:26,402
I looked at a really interesting report from the EEOC and what that said was that I was specifically looking at harassment at the time because we were sort of the me to movement was emerging.

117
00:27:26,402 --> 00:27:45,002
And I was thinking about solutions to people not Harassment in particular and I found some really fascinating data and what it said is that 75% of people who experience sexual harassment in the workplace, never report it, right?

118
00:27:45,002 --> 00:28:01,102
So they don't share that information with someone who could actually take action and address it out of that 25%, who do report it according to the EEOC 75% of those individuals face, some type of retaliation Ation for speaking up.

119
00:28:01,402 --> 00:28:11,702
So to me, I looked at those two stats and took them together and realize like these data points, really represent a broken system, like you said Gina.

120
00:28:11,702 --> 00:28:22,002
So I think historically like preemie to movement pre 2017, we as a society, basically, just that Okay.

121
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:25,302
Employees like speak of or nobody will help you.

122
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:29,402
And those are kind of your two options and employees for the most part.

123
00:28:29,402 --> 00:28:35,202
According to that data, just stayed quiet and maybe they became disengaged unproductive.

124
00:28:35,302 --> 00:28:36,902
Maybe they quit their jobs.

125
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:49,502
You know, even during the Great resignation, I think there was a stab at 57% of people who left their jobs during the Great resignation of 2021 left because they felt disrespected at work.

126
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:59,602
So these are solvable Issues, right, but someone at the company needs to know what's going on in order to take action to try to help resolve it.

127
00:29:00,602 --> 00:29:12,502
So I think just to go back to the beginning, like we have had a broken system for a really long time and for so long it was just like, okay, deal with it.

128
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:21,402
And I think what happened in during the me to movement is that the public took great interest in how employees were being treated and started to make it okay?

129
00:29:21,502 --> 00:29:38,602
For employees to share their experiences publicly and to actually hold companies accountable in the public eye for the behavior that was happening within their companies, even if leadership wasn't aware, it was sort of like, it doesn't matter.

130
00:29:38,602 --> 00:29:41,102
And the fact that you're not aware is the problem.

131
00:29:42,102 --> 00:29:51,402
So, that's kind of the evolution that I have seen since then is that there's a lot more accountability for companies and there's a lot more required of them.

132
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:55,802
And so, to this question about, how is the best way to provide constructive feedback?

133
00:29:55,902 --> 00:30:00,902
I really think companies need to create multiple options or multiple channels.

134
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:05,202
Like I said, before for employees to speak up, so have an open door policy.

135
00:30:05,202 --> 00:30:14,402
Make sure they know who on the HR team or the employer relations team for the executive team to go talk to if they're having a challenge or an experience.

136
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:19,602
Give them tips for having actually conversations with their own direct leadership.

137
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:25,502
But also, make sure there's a secondary channel for employees.

138
00:30:25,502 --> 00:30:33,002
Speak up that feels a lot safer to them where they can be anonymous, where they don't have to fear retaliation just for having spoken up.

139
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:43,202
I mean, you see companies put out those annual surveys, you know you could like Google search the questions and drop them into like a Google form and send it out.

140
00:30:43,202 --> 00:30:43,902
You know what I am saying?

141
00:30:45,002 --> 00:30:51,402
Are those effective and you know, that is that a channel as well?

142
00:30:52,002 --> 00:30:54,802
To be considered or what are your thoughts there?

143
00:30:57,102 --> 00:31:01,302
I don't think they're effective at solving the problem that we're talking about today.

144
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:09,302
I think they solve a different problem which is at a given point in time and over a period of time, right?

145
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:16,302
Year over year what is the sort of overall high-level cultural health of my organization?

146
00:31:16,602 --> 00:31:18,502
And is it trending in the right direction or not?

147
00:31:19,802 --> 00:31:25,702
That I think is what those annual culture, surveys are good for it, and I think they have a role.

148
00:31:25,702 --> 00:31:33,202
It's great to, it's great to measure that what it's not great at is, let us say you send that survey out in January every year.

149
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:36,902
And in February, I have an issue and I don't know who to talk to.

150
00:31:37,302 --> 00:31:38,802
It's an issue with my manager.

151
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:39,402
I am nervous.

152
00:31:39,402 --> 00:31:40,502
Bringing it up to my manager.

153
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:48,702
I don't feel like I have the tools, maybe I was retaliated against at a past company and so, I am especially scared or hesitant to bring something up.

154
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:52,602
And I am, Receiving a culture survey until next January.

155
00:31:52,802 --> 00:31:55,002
So am I supposed to you as the employee?

156
00:31:55,002 --> 00:32:04,502
Just stay quiet and gut it out over 11 months and then put something in a culture survey that I am not even sure will be followed up on.

157
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:06,702
I am not even sure if it's possible to be followed up on.

158
00:32:06,702 --> 00:32:11,402
I am not sure if it's Anonymous or not, I don't know the difference between Anonymous and confidential.

159
00:32:13,702 --> 00:32:25,102
There needs to be a real-time solution in place for those types of issues so that they can get resolved now and not in 11 months or, you know, possibly never.

160
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:43,302
So if you were to break out the different types of channels, you mentioned, you know, having an open door policy and being able to have that conversation, both ways and police should feel that openness and their one-on-ones with their manager and vice versa.

161
00:32:44,302 --> 00:33:10,502
And then you mentioned, you know, maybe it's quarterly or annually annual surveys to gauge patterns of Health but then there's the ongoing that you're talking about and what are some recommended channels that we could tactically use today for something that's a little bit ongoing outside of the one-on-ones that you may have with your team member or manager on a weekly basis.

162
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:11,002
Let us say.

163
00:33:12,202 --> 00:33:12,502
Yeah.

164
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:17,702
So a couple of those, a couple of solutions we have built right?

165
00:33:17,702 --> 00:33:22,102
One is all voices Anonymous feedback Channel letting employees be kept in.

166
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:27,802
Real time, anonymously sharing feedback and then communicating back and forth with that employee.

167
00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:32,702
Another one we have that we think has been really valuable to our customers is pulse surveys.

168
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:38,902
So, let us say that, you're so not a big annual culture survey with 50 questions, right?

169
00:33:39,302 --> 00:33:42,702
That needs like a data scientist to analyze all the Service for you.

170
00:33:42,702 --> 00:33:49,802
But let us say you're hearing about a specific topic, like, oh, I don't like our new PTO policy and you're hearing that through all voices.

171
00:33:49,802 --> 00:33:52,402
Maybe some managers are hearing whispers of that.

172
00:33:52,602 --> 00:33:55,302
It's starting to kind of like Ripple through the organization.

173
00:33:55,602 --> 00:34:02,602
You could send out a pulse survey that day and say hey wanted to ask some questions about our new PTO policy.

174
00:34:02,602 --> 00:34:06,302
One is this better or worse than our previous policy to?

175
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,502
What are the things you would like to see that?

176
00:34:08,502 --> 00:34:11,802
The policy includes that it doesn't include three Etc.

177
00:34:11,902 --> 00:34:12,202
Right?

178
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:16,302
And you're, you're pulling information in real time.

179
00:34:16,302 --> 00:34:25,002
And then you're pushing request for more information back out about a very specific and actionable topic, so that can be incredibly valuable to.

180
00:34:25,002 --> 00:34:32,202
And then, the third tool that I have started to hear more and more about leaders using is stay interviews.

181
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:43,402
So, I think those need to be conducted in concert with some of these other sort of measurement tactics and tools but stator Use earn opportunity.

182
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:45,002
So we all know about exit interviews, right?

183
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:50,702
Which is like when someone leaves you conduct an exit interview to find out why they left and that's helpful.

184
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:54,002
But it doesn't help you in retaining that employee, right?

185
00:34:54,002 --> 00:34:55,101
They have already left.

186
00:34:55,702 --> 00:35:03,702
So, it's a little bit too late and hopefully you use the exit interviews to prevent others from leaving, but it doesn't help with that.

187
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:04,802
The ones who have already left.

188
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:16,302
So stay interviews are sort of the inverse of that, which is leaders from within the company set up time to You just talk one-on-one with individual employees about why they're stay right?

189
00:35:16,302 --> 00:35:17,602
Why they're not leaving.

190
00:35:18,302 --> 00:35:20,802
So it's an opportunity to say like what's working?

191
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:22,802
Well, what do you like about your job?

192
00:35:22,802 --> 00:35:24,302
What do you like about the company?

193
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:27,802
Also, what's not working, how can we better support you?

194
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:31,502
How can we meet your needs better as an employee?

195
00:35:31,502 --> 00:35:34,302
How do we make sure that you're still here a year from now?

196
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:49,502
And I think the combination of all of those different practices can be incredibly valuable at painting like a Comprehensive picture of what's going on with employees at is really interesting, the state interviews.

197
00:35:49,802 --> 00:35:51,502
What's the frequency?

198
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:58,302
And do you recommend leaders that are not the direct manager of the employee?

199
00:35:59,002 --> 00:36:00,002
I do, yes.

200
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:04,202
I think, I think it's actually a great role for HR.

201
00:36:04,302 --> 00:36:11,702
I think HR business partners, and HR leaders spending time talking to employees about just how they're doing it.

202
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:12,802
In general, right?

203
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:16,302
Not around a specific incident or investigation.

204
00:36:16,302 --> 00:36:18,502
But just like, how are you doing?

205
00:36:18,502 --> 00:36:20,102
Conducting a stay interview.

206
00:36:20,402 --> 00:36:21,402
Anything that's not working.

207
00:36:21,402 --> 00:36:23,302
Well, how is your relationship with your manager?

208
00:36:23,302 --> 00:36:30,002
Like all of these things are helpful and, and to go back to my earlier point, there might be hesitation in those conversations, right?

209
00:36:30,002 --> 00:36:41,802
There might be fear from employees still, but at least you're giving them the opportunity to speak up and showing them that you and the organization are receptive to feedback and want.

210
00:36:41,902 --> 00:36:45,002
Feedback and hopefully by having additional ways for them to speak up.

211
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:56,502
Like I said, the stay interview in combination with all voices reports in combination with, you know, the poll surveys and the annual culture survey that together paints a more comprehensive picture.

212
00:36:56,802 --> 00:36:57,602
Gotcha?

213
00:36:57,702 --> 00:36:58,302
Okay.

214
00:36:58,502 --> 00:37:09,602
So one of the other thoughts I have is being able to create a culture that feels safe to conduct these ongoing pulse surveys.

215
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:20,002
And you know, you're asking its listening a lot of Information from your employees but then I think from an employee perspective, you know, my employers asking all this stuff, what are they going to do with it?

216
00:37:20,402 --> 00:37:29,902
You know, and I think there needs to be proven ways to demonstrate that their that on her door, that actions be taken.

217
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:30,902
So that goes to one of them.

218
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:33,002
There's a question that's been submitted here.

219
00:37:33,202 --> 00:37:34,502
It's got four up votes.

220
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:41,002
I have seen many organizations struggle with how to share and act on employee feedback.

221
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:46,502
How can Relations execute action around feedback better?

222
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:50,202
Hmm, I got a great question.

223
00:37:51,602 --> 00:38:05,002
So basically, I think we're starting to get to a point where companies know, they have to provide ways for employees to share feedback, but I think sometimes the missing piece is then converting that feedback into action.

224
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:14,602
So one of the things that I mentioned, right, the pulse survey, that's actually a great example of showing employees.

225
00:38:14,602 --> 00:38:19,502
So let us say, let us say four employees submitted Concerns about the PTO policy.

226
00:38:19,902 --> 00:38:24,502
And then a week later, you the HR leader are sending the entire company.

227
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:37,802
A survey about the PTO policy that's actually actioned that's showing that you are looking into something that is being brought up and trying to continuously improve, whatever it is, that was raised as a potential issue.

228
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:46,202
So the pulse survey itself is a form of action and then in response to the pulse survey, there's additional action that can be taken.

229
00:38:46,202 --> 00:38:50,302
So maybe, At an all-hands meeting you share the results of the poll survey.

230
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:55,802
You say 75 percent of people in the company feel good about our PTO policy.

231
00:38:55,802 --> 00:39:00,202
And the number one Improvement that was requested was bereavement leave.

232
00:39:00,402 --> 00:39:06,802
So we are going to add bereavement leave since that's something, we have never had and something that the majority of you wanted.

233
00:39:07,802 --> 00:39:12,002
That's all and that's not rocketed science, right?

234
00:39:12,002 --> 00:39:21,402
That's simply being responsive to the feedback that you're getting and then communicating the responsiveness, which I think is sometimes the missing piece.

235
00:39:22,302 --> 00:39:34,202
Another example of something we have heard from customers, is that communication piece is sometimes just missing like leadership knows something, but they haven't yet communicated it down to the rest of the organization.

236
00:39:34,202 --> 00:39:39,002
So one of our customers was getting a bunch of reports about Space issues.

237
00:39:39,102 --> 00:39:46,402
Like we're all, you know, the pre-pandemic but like we're all, you know, elbow-to-elbow, I can't even like breathe in my space.

238
00:39:46,402 --> 00:39:47,602
Like, what is going on?

239
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:55,002
Meanwhile, leadership had been looking for a new office space for the last like, four months so that search was underway.

240
00:39:55,002 --> 00:40:04,402
But employees had no idea because oftentimes leadership as leadership, we don't announce things until they're done or at least more solidified.

241
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,202
But sometimes it's just a matter of saying we heard you.

242
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:15,002
No, this is you know we are all crammed in here and this is untenable, we are in the search for an office space.

243
00:40:15,002 --> 00:40:18,502
We think we will have One Secured in the next three to six months.

244
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:24,102
And in the meantime, we're looking into, you know, getting some satellite office options, right?

245
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:31,502
It's not always about having a fully baked solution to roll out and announce with a perfectly executed, communication strategy.

246
00:40:31,502 --> 00:40:36,602
Sometimes it's just communicating that you're working on something and that, you know, it's an issue.

247
00:40:39,002 --> 00:41:01,102
So that yes, I think Paula just mentioned here, the positive energy you got from asking for feedback can be negated if there is a lack of action on that feedback so it is very critical and I guess one of my questions would be, who is there a point person that should be responsible to handle the surveys?

248
00:41:01,202 --> 00:41:06,502
Make sure it's properly being communicated out like what team generally is responsible.

249
00:41:07,202 --> 00:41:10,502
And if you know, like It's a I would assume HR right?

250
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:13,502
But what if you don't have an HR room?

251
00:41:14,502 --> 00:41:18,202
Yeah, I was just going to say it really depends on the size of the organization.

252
00:41:18,202 --> 00:41:21,602
So let us say you're a 10-person company, right?

253
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:30,702
We have been a 10-person company, and we didn't have HR at that time, but we still, but you still want to create opportunities for people to share feedback.

254
00:41:31,302 --> 00:41:43,802
I think it's an initiative that in the earlier days or in the smaller days needs to be led by the CEO, I think creating a healthy culture is ultimately a part of the CEOs job.

255
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:46,002
It's not just about delivering results.

256
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:55,502
It's about how do you get those results and part of that is hiring recruiting retaining key emphasis on retaining employees.

257
00:41:56,902 --> 00:42:05,702
So, you know, in the early days like I let all of our culture initiatives, I am still super involved in our culture initiatives, and we now have almost 40 employees.

258
00:42:05,702 --> 00:42:18,202
So I think it has to come from the Top down, it has to in order, especially in order for people to feel like action is actually going to be taken, right?

259
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:35,902
Because if you pass off the initiative to someone who then doesn't have the ability to take action or you're not providing a way for them to take action on the feedback received that can actually to Paul is point that can actually backfire and have a negative impact.

260
00:42:37,202 --> 00:42:38,102
That's good to know.

261
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:42,602
Okay, we have got another question with some pretty high up votes here.

262
00:42:43,402 --> 00:42:46,802
Before closing a feedback conversation.

263
00:42:47,102 --> 00:42:51,402
How do you best ensure that the feedback has been understood?

264
00:42:54,402 --> 00:43:05,702
So I think that miscommunications always happen or can happen and so it is really good to clarify the information that you're receiving.

265
00:43:06,902 --> 00:43:10,502
So I guess this answer would differ a bit depending on the context.

266
00:43:11,702 --> 00:43:18,502
So in a state interview I would actually say repeating things back to the employee.

267
00:43:18,702 --> 00:43:22,502
This is kind of what you're saying, let me make sure I understand it.

268
00:43:22,702 --> 00:43:27,402
In rephrase it back to them, and then they have the opportunity to say.

269
00:43:27,402 --> 00:43:28,502
No, not exactly.

270
00:43:28,502 --> 00:43:40,102
I am actually saying more than this so that you really both leave that conversation with complete clarity about at least what was being said, you don't have to solve the problem in the meeting, right?

271
00:43:40,202 --> 00:43:43,002
You don't have to come up with all the answers in the meeting.

272
00:43:43,202 --> 00:43:52,502
This is really an opportunity to listen and this type of listening if it's done, effectively would mean that you both walk out of that.

273
00:43:52,602 --> 00:43:57,602
Conversation with the same understanding of that person's experience and what they share.

274
00:43:59,502 --> 00:44:01,802
So how do you, you know, we have built a software platform?

275
00:44:01,802 --> 00:44:08,802
So how do you kind of like mimic that experience through a digital communication Channel?

276
00:44:08,802 --> 00:44:14,602
There's a couple things one, you can still repeat back digitally like hey this is what I am hearing.

277
00:44:14,602 --> 00:44:15,302
Does this make sense?

278
00:44:15,302 --> 00:44:19,002
You can clarify what you think as the HR leader?

279
00:44:19,002 --> 00:44:22,602
What the next steps are and how you know how that works for?

280
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:23,402
Other person.

281
00:44:24,602 --> 00:44:46,102
But then actually we have built into our product and additional data point, which is after the employee and the employer and the conversation, and that conversation gets marked by the administrator as resolved, so they can track like, how many open issues do I have versus closed?

282
00:44:46,702 --> 00:44:48,102
We actually all voices.

283
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,202
Send a follow-up survey to the employee.

284
00:44:50,402 --> 00:44:52,502
And it's just, it's still an honor.

285
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:55,502
Amos and it's just like two questions.

286
00:44:55,702 --> 00:45:07,902
How satisfied are you with the way that was handled, and we're any steps taken to address the issue that you raised and then that data goes back to the HR leader.

287
00:45:08,102 --> 00:45:16,502
So maybe the HR person thinks that something has been totally satisfactorily resolved, but the employee does not feel that way.

288
00:45:16,702 --> 00:45:21,602
Then they can reopen the conversation and say, hey, I saw that you didn't feel like this was quite handled.

289
00:45:22,702 --> 00:45:23,902
Now to resolution.

290
00:45:24,202 --> 00:45:25,302
What else do you need?

291
00:45:25,402 --> 00:45:26,702
What am I missing?

292
00:45:26,702 --> 00:45:28,202
What else can I do for you?

293
00:45:28,502 --> 00:45:33,102
Where do you think you know the gaps are or the opportunity to improve this further?

294
00:45:33,802 --> 00:45:39,702
So that's another sort of like tool that helps make sure everyone is on the same page.

295
00:45:39,902 --> 00:45:41,402
What were those two questions again?

296
00:45:41,402 --> 00:45:44,502
How satisfied are you with how it was handled?

297
00:45:44,502 --> 00:45:45,202
And what else?

298
00:45:45,802 --> 00:45:52,502
So, it's basically been you aware of the company taking steps to address the issue that you raised and how satisfied are you with the way?

299
00:45:52,602 --> 00:45:55,002
It was handled on it, that's good.

300
00:45:55,002 --> 00:46:02,802
So, that's sort of guy this question that can be asked after the one-on-one session that a manager may have with their employee.

301
00:46:03,102 --> 00:46:08,002
And then, you need that third party, though, to probably be filtering through that.

302
00:46:08,002 --> 00:46:14,102
And then providing you need that system to have that conversation and feedback.

303
00:46:14,102 --> 00:46:17,602
Go back to the manager, you know, that the invoice.

304
00:46:17,702 --> 00:46:19,502
Now, what about the other way around?

305
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:22,502
As an employee, you know, going back to those poll results.

306
00:46:23,002 --> 00:46:31,202
It is very challenging to provide negative feedback to your manager to the leadership.

307
00:46:31,402 --> 00:46:48,502
So let us say we don't have all of those channels that you have identified Claire Where did you start as an employee to have a constructive conversation with your dirt direct manager?

308
00:46:50,202 --> 00:47:02,702
Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, the way I think about this is that the best way to build trust with employees, is by listening and taking action.

309
00:47:02,702 --> 00:47:05,302
So you have to build trust over time.

310
00:47:05,302 --> 00:47:10,502
And I think in some ways all voices is kind of shortcut to building that trust Is it gives you the information?

311
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:13,002
You may not be getting and helps you show.

312
00:47:13,002 --> 00:47:23,802
Like, it's okay to bring things up, and we will actually take action even if we have no idea who you are in the absence of a tool like that, you have to do a little more heavy lifting yourself, right?

313
00:47:23,802 --> 00:47:32,102
You have to have you know, many opportunities for employees to share their feedback, directly with you as a manager.

314
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:34,302
You have to ask a lot of questions, right?

315
00:47:34,302 --> 00:47:39,002
You have to get an in-depth understanding of what that employees experience.

316
00:47:39,302 --> 00:47:45,002
Are there any like roadblocks for them are there do they feel good about their career path?

317
00:47:45,002 --> 00:47:45,402
You know?

318
00:47:45,402 --> 00:48:19,002
And these conversations are most likely happening between a manager and their employee and I think over time if you show them that when they share feedback even if it's constructive or negative feedback that they're not fired, but they're not demoted that they're not shut out of projects continuously just asking for it and showing that Want it and then having no repercussions or — you know retaliation or anything like that happen as a result that can very slowly build trust as well.

319
00:48:19,002 --> 00:48:27,302
Because they will say okay, two weeks ago, I told my manager this thing, and they actually thanked me for my feedback, nothing bad has happened.

320
00:48:27,302 --> 00:48:39,002
Since then, I think I can bring up another issue so it's about like building the trust via two-way communication to start to make employees fill.

321
00:48:39,102 --> 00:48:40,102
More comfortable.

322
00:48:40,602 --> 00:48:52,002
So let us say you're in a culture where That trust has not been built but as an employee I still need to voice certain things to my employer.

323
00:48:53,002 --> 00:48:55,802
How would I even start that conversation?

324
00:48:56,002 --> 00:49:00,002
Where it wouldn't get to like maybe subjective or emotional?

325
00:49:00,002 --> 00:49:15,102
Like you have any Frameworks of recommendation of how an employee can even approach a manager with you know, the feedback I think it's really hard when there's not trusted.

326
00:49:15,102 --> 00:49:15,702
I do.

327
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:25,802
I think, I think people are scared, you know, part of it is our jobs are not just like something we do for fun, right?

328
00:49:25,802 --> 00:49:28,002
Our jobs are how we pay our bills.

329
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:30,002
It's how we take care of our families.

330
00:49:30,002 --> 00:49:31,202
It's how we pay rent.

331
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:32,502
It's how we buy food.

332
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:41,902
And so when evaluating kind of like the cost benefit of bringing something up, that might be difficult in a context where you haven't built.

333
00:49:42,002 --> 00:49:44,502
Us with someone and you don't feel trust in them.

334
00:49:46,102 --> 00:50:02,102
It can just feel too risky and a lot of employees and up just staying quiet because they don't want to bring up something difficult with someone they don't trust in, you know, two months later, find themself fire.

335
00:50:03,902 --> 00:50:06,502
So it's about you know, as an employee.

336
00:50:06,502 --> 00:50:12,202
I don't want to give employees sort of like false confidence that no Matter.

337
00:50:12,202 --> 00:50:14,602
What if you bring things up, it will all be, okay?

338
00:50:14,602 --> 00:50:16,202
Like I don't think that's true.

339
00:50:16,602 --> 00:50:21,802
Is that where we should be heading as a society, is that the kind of culture that?

340
00:50:21,802 --> 00:50:30,902
I am sure everybody on this call wants to build at their companies, of course, but there's a gap between where we are today and where we want to be.

341
00:50:31,202 --> 00:50:34,702
And so that's why I started all voices to bridge the gap.

342
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:58,602
But over time, what I would love to see is that there's a ton of opportunity for It healthy candid conversations within companies between managers and their direct reports between employees and HR between employees and the CEO and that it's in an environment free from retaliation.

343
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:03,902
That's where we want to be, but we're just not there yet.

344
00:51:04,202 --> 00:51:14,002
Okay, I appreciate your honesty in that and, you know, we're hoping that everyone on this call here if your Eating an organization starts at the top.

345
00:51:14,902 --> 00:51:23,502
So there're opportunities to start building trust today with your employees and creating a nurturing that kind of environment.

346
00:51:24,002 --> 00:51:28,502
All right, we have got another question here that I think relates to what we were just talking about.

347
00:51:28,802 --> 00:51:39,202
How do you communicate to your CEO that their behavior and reaction to things is making people leave It's really hard?

348
00:51:41,902 --> 00:51:55,302
You know, in a situation like that, unless you have a really strong relationship with the CEO and you have built a lot of trust with them, you know, maybe you're their director Porter, you have known them for a long time.

349
00:51:57,002 --> 00:51:59,002
It's really tricky to do.

350
00:51:59,002 --> 00:52:02,002
I think some of that has to come anonymously?

351
00:52:03,102 --> 00:52:11,502
Maybe your company has a 3D 360 feedback programs where people who report to someone get to also share?

352
00:52:11,702 --> 00:52:19,902
Their feedback like as a performance review, that's like one opportunity potentially or it's through some type of anonymous Channel.

353
00:52:21,702 --> 00:52:31,002
But you know, I have tried to build like incredibly transparent culture healthy candid, like we really walk.

354
00:52:31,002 --> 00:52:33,002
The walk of what we're trying to do?

355
00:52:33,102 --> 00:52:34,902
We use our own tool internally.

356
00:52:35,202 --> 00:52:38,302
I also have like an open door policy, like put time on my calendar.

357
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:39,002
Come talk to me.

358
00:52:39,002 --> 00:52:39,502
What's working?

359
00:52:39,502 --> 00:52:40,302
What's not working?

360
00:52:40,802 --> 00:52:53,202
I still No, it is really hard for people to speak up to me even about challenges, they're having with someone else at the company, let alone challenges, they're having with me, right?

361
00:52:53,302 --> 00:52:54,302
My behavior.

362
00:52:54,302 --> 00:52:56,502
I think that's just incredibly intimidating.

363
00:52:58,702 --> 00:53:18,002
So I think CEOs need to be doing a better job of asking questions of getting to know people of building trust and Rapport of even saying like hey does everyone Here, feel comfortable sharing feedback directly with me and if not, like, what could I do to better?

364
00:53:18,002 --> 00:53:30,902
Encourage that like, even one step removed from actually setting up a system where the feedback can be, shared is asking like, is there a feeling of safety of psychological safety, right?

365
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:51,402
Because I think this question really indicates, like the structural challenge that exist today, which is that, I as the CEO or any CEO, hot have more power in the organization than, like, a junior employee or someone who might have feedback for me.

366
00:53:51,702 --> 00:54:02,002
And so, just by definition in that hierarchy, it is challenging for the person who's more Junior to give critical feedback to the person who's more senior.

367
00:54:02,002 --> 00:54:04,502
So, we have to, And workarounds to that.

368
00:54:06,102 --> 00:54:11,002
So at the very least, we have to figure out ways to provide Anonymous feedback.

369
00:54:11,302 --> 00:54:12,202
Maybe that's the way.

370
00:54:12,702 --> 00:54:21,102
Absolutely back to whoever Point person it is but figuring out just a way to get that information to them.

371
00:54:21,402 --> 00:54:24,002
And actually, there's a related question here.

372
00:54:24,502 --> 00:54:29,202
What are the words one would use to tell the owner CEO?

373
00:54:29,602 --> 00:54:34,202
Hey, you are our biggest problem, the CEO is not going anywhere.

374
00:54:34,202 --> 00:54:41,502
The owner, you know, So the choice becomes one of improvement versus losing the employee.

375
00:54:42,802 --> 00:54:43,302
Yeah.

376
00:54:43,502 --> 00:54:44,702
It's tough.

377
00:54:44,702 --> 00:54:46,002
Just like we were just talking about.

378
00:54:46,002 --> 00:55:01,402
Like, I don't recommend someone on this call, go to their CEO and say you're our biggest problem or I can't even think of a great phrasing that would make that message go over well.

379
00:55:01,902 --> 00:55:07,002
But what I can say is that the CEO does need the information in order to improve sometimes.

380
00:55:07,002 --> 00:55:11,702
It's just about self-awareness, we hopefully all like ourselves.

381
00:55:11,702 --> 00:55:18,102
And sometimes we don't see the gaps in the areas of improvement that we have.

382
00:55:18,102 --> 00:55:20,902
So, hopefully, the CEO is working on themselves.

383
00:55:20,902 --> 00:55:24,902
Hopefully, the CEO has a coach or hopefully the CEO Is.

384
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:31,102
Talking to advisors, right talking to their board?

385
00:55:31,602 --> 00:55:37,402
Getting that feedback from someone who is more of a peer and not someone who is Junior to them.

386
00:55:37,902 --> 00:56:09,002
But ultimately, at the end of the day, the people who report to the CEO or the people who report to the CEO are the ones that have the best insight into how the CEOs, you know, style personality, whatever are impacting the business's ability to succeed and that's why Needs to be some type of anonymous channel, for this, exact type of situation because I think in some cases with awareness CEOs and leaders can improve.

387
00:56:09,302 --> 00:56:13,702
So it doesn't have to be, you know, you can't speak up to the CEO.

388
00:56:13,702 --> 00:56:15,402
So you just have to leave your job.

389
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:19,902
There has to be a third option, but they have to get the information first.

390
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:24,902
And if you give them the information through an anonymous Channel, and then they still don't improve.

391
00:56:25,902 --> 00:56:30,802
Then it's a really tough situation then I would potentially start looking for a new job.

392
00:56:33,002 --> 00:56:33,802
That's unfortunate.

393
00:56:33,802 --> 00:56:34,402
It's real.

394
00:56:34,502 --> 00:56:50,302
I think it's real for a lot of people I think working remote or distributed also makes it even more challenging to be able to communicate in general and then communicate such sensitive information back to a leader.

395
00:56:50,702 --> 00:57:02,402
You know, as you were talking about power dynamics, and I am seeing Clarissa and Christina plus one that I am wondering if there's certain key leaders around?

396
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:16,302
On the CEO who and employee could feel safe to speak to and hopefully get a message relayed through you know the powers that be in the leadership team to the CEO.

397
00:57:16,302 --> 00:57:18,202
What are your thoughts about that?

398
00:57:18,202 --> 00:57:24,202
And, you know, I am really curious to hear a little bit more about the power Dynamic aspect as well around feedback.

399
00:57:27,102 --> 00:57:39,702
I just think it's tough if you're trying to get a message to the CEO and you talk to someone whose close to them, there is the chance that it could backfire.

400
00:57:39,802 --> 00:57:42,002
Right person is close to them.

401
00:57:42,002 --> 00:57:44,102
It just depends on the CEOs personality.

402
00:57:44,102 --> 00:57:47,802
It depends on the organizational culture, but just being really honest here.

403
00:57:47,802 --> 00:57:57,402
Like, the person whose close to CEO could say, hey Gina like was speaking really badly about you and suddenly The CEOs.

404
00:57:57,402 --> 00:58:03,002
Like this is a disloyal employee, they aren't on board with the mission.

405
00:58:03,002 --> 00:58:07,102
They don't value me as a leader, whatever it is, they could misinterpret.

406
00:58:07,102 --> 00:58:18,002
Like there's kind of game of telephone sometimes with things like that even if you were trying to be helpful which I am sure most people are but it can backfire.

407
00:58:18,002 --> 00:58:47,102
So I just don't want to sort of sugarcoat, you know, I truly believe in feedback but I still don't think the systems that we have in place are set up to protect people enough that they can just freely share feedback with anyone at anytime and I don't want to encourage people to just go for it and then have it backfires.

408
00:58:47,102 --> 00:58:56,502
Like, even on this call, I don't want someone to leader email me and be like, hey, I followed your advice about being really candid and I got fired because the reality is that can't happen.

409
00:58:56,502 --> 00:58:59,402
Now, of course, we hope that never happens.

410
00:58:59,902 --> 00:59:08,102
Of course, I think things are shifting to the point where organizations are more receptive to feedback, they do view feedback as a positive thing.

411
00:59:08,102 --> 00:59:21,002
Even if it's technically — They know that they need to go above and beyond and to do more to help employees and to keep employees, it's still a really competitive job market.

412
00:59:21,002 --> 00:59:27,302
So there is an interest in making sure that companies are doing everything possible to retain employees.

413
00:59:27,702 --> 00:59:32,902
But I just wouldn't want that strategy to backfire on someone.

414
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:37,102
And I would feel bad if that happened.

415
00:59:37,102 --> 00:59:39,302
So I really can't encourage that.

416
00:59:39,602 --> 00:59:46,002
You obviously are the expert on your Company culture, the power dynamics, the relationships between people.

417
00:59:46,002 --> 00:59:53,202
If you have someone that you really trust and feel safe with I would recommend having the conversation if you want to have it, but framing it less.

418
00:59:53,202 --> 01:00:06,102
As the CEO is our problem and is causing all the problems to like, you know, I feel like a, you know, a more neutral way of phrasing it.

419
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:19,102
So, I feel like, you know, sometimes the blunt Is of the CEO is off-putting to employees or something like that and then maybe that feedback will get back to them in a constructive way.

420
01:00:19,402 --> 01:00:23,502
But I can't, I can't say go for it.

421
01:00:23,602 --> 01:00:24,102
Yep.

422
01:00:24,702 --> 01:00:26,302
That's good.

423
01:00:26,702 --> 01:00:58,702
And I think there's something to you know if an employee is still on board with the mission and believes in the team there, despite these things that they're experiencing from seat the CEO if they're able to Provide the feedback with the best intent, then wouldn't that get received hopefully better with the leader versus just like, you know, getting really hard and maybe there could be some bitterness and even resentment.

424
01:00:58,702 --> 01:01:07,402
It's like behind some words, it's like be very selective of the words to make sure that you're always in the best interest of the company.

425
01:01:07,802 --> 01:01:11,902
And then it's almost like the sandwich effect, right?

426
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:18,402
You give some of your best intentions and positive aspects, feedback of the company.

427
01:01:18,402 --> 01:01:22,402
And then you question it with some of the constructive feedback.

428
01:01:22,602 --> 01:01:23,102
You know.

429
01:01:23,802 --> 01:01:28,202
That could be a way to provide that feedback directly to L.

430
01:01:28,202 --> 01:01:28,502
Yeah.

431
01:01:29,902 --> 01:01:30,202
Yeah.

432
01:01:30,902 --> 01:01:32,602
We have a couple more questions.

433
01:01:34,302 --> 01:01:35,202
Let us get bees.

434
01:01:35,202 --> 01:01:36,602
Use question up there.

435
01:01:36,802 --> 01:01:45,902
It'd be great to get your thoughts on how companies can ensure psychological safety while soliciting candid feedback from the org.

436
01:01:47,502 --> 01:01:51,302
Yeah, so psychological safety is critical.

437
01:01:51,302 --> 01:01:56,202
We talk about it all the time and all voices, one of our advisors is Amy Edmondson.

438
01:01:56,202 --> 01:02:18,502
Who's a professor at Harvard Business School, and she's one of the foremost experts on psychological safety in the workplace and the way She defines psychological safety is the ability to fail or make mistakes without being punished and that can include the ability to speak up without being punished to.

439
01:02:18,502 --> 01:02:18,802
Right?

440
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:27,202
It's not just failing, but it's doing something and not feeling like you're going to be punished for it.

441
01:02:28,002 --> 01:02:33,302
So I think the best way to create it is to show it, right?

442
01:02:33,302 --> 01:02:42,702
Not Tell people, so if I go to an all hands, and I am like, hey we have a psychological psychologically safe environment, if you fail, it's okay those are just words.

443
01:02:42,702 --> 01:02:46,202
It doesn't really mean much to people to hear that.

444
01:02:46,402 --> 01:02:48,402
At the end of the day, they have to see it.

445
01:02:48,402 --> 01:03:03,502
I think in order to really internalize it and so what might be more effective for me as a leader or for a manager right on our team is to talk about the mistakes they have made talk about the places where they made the wrong decision, or they focused on the wrong.

446
01:03:03,702 --> 01:03:13,802
Initiative or, you know, they shot for the stars, and they missed, but to use it as an opportunity to show people that, it's okay, I am still here.

447
01:03:13,902 --> 01:03:15,702
We're still here, right?

448
01:03:15,802 --> 01:03:17,802
The organization is still doing well.

449
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:20,502
We learned a ton from it, and here's what we learned.

450
01:03:20,502 --> 01:03:23,002
And here's how we might do things differently in the future.

451
01:03:23,402 --> 01:03:31,702
Because I think you want to encourage people to take risks at work, you want to encourage them to try new things and to learn as they go.

452
01:03:31,902 --> 01:03:35,702
And I think the only way to do that, Is to show them that when they do it.

453
01:03:36,302 --> 01:03:44,102
It's encouraged and that they aren't being punished for when things don't work out.

454
01:03:45,702 --> 01:03:46,402
That's key.

455
01:03:47,902 --> 01:03:49,002
That's really good.

456
01:03:49,102 --> 01:03:50,102
That's a great.

457
01:03:50,102 --> 01:03:52,902
Great definition of psychological safety.

458
01:03:53,502 --> 01:03:54,902
We have got another question.

459
01:03:55,102 --> 01:03:55,402
Okay.

460
01:03:55,402 --> 01:04:01,002
Sorry, one, last thing I would add the same thing goes for feedback, so someone gives constructive feedback.

461
01:04:01,102 --> 01:04:01,402
You say.

462
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:02,802
Thank you for the feedback.

463
01:04:02,902 --> 01:04:04,802
Here's what I am To do as a result.

464
01:04:05,402 --> 01:04:08,902
You know, they don't get fired, they don't get demoted, they don't get, shut out of things.

465
01:04:09,202 --> 01:04:13,702
They don't get Scolded by someone right?

466
01:04:13,802 --> 01:04:16,302
Then the next time they feel more comfortable giving feedback.

467
01:04:16,302 --> 01:04:19,902
So that's kind of like the feedback version of psychological safety.

468
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:21,102
Mmm.

469
01:04:21,902 --> 01:04:22,802
So good.

470
01:04:23,102 --> 01:04:26,502
And I am seeing Clarissa and Bijou spots here.

471
01:04:28,002 --> 01:04:29,202
Thank you for the FEMA.

472
01:04:29,202 --> 01:04:35,802
Yes be the example show not tell and being vulnerable transparent As Leaders.

473
01:04:35,802 --> 01:04:41,602
There's such power in that When leaders can actually let down their guard.

474
01:04:41,902 --> 01:04:48,302
And constructively, you know, share that, and also a follow-up to what they're sharing.

475
01:04:49,202 --> 01:04:49,502
All right?

476
01:04:49,502 --> 01:04:51,002
We have got another question.

477
01:04:51,002 --> 01:04:53,902
Our final question and just a few minutes left.

478
01:04:53,902 --> 01:04:56,802
So if anyone else has questions, drop them right now.

479
01:04:57,702 --> 01:04:59,402
How do we help staff?

480
01:04:59,402 --> 01:05:06,602
And managers who have had negative experiences with feedback, you ready and open to feedback sessions.

481
01:05:08,602 --> 01:05:09,102
Who?

482
01:05:10,002 --> 01:05:20,502
Well, I think one question that I would ask that question is, what does it mean — experiences with feedback?

483
01:05:20,502 --> 01:05:20,902
Right.

484
01:05:20,902 --> 01:05:29,402
So I would really take a look at what's causing that person to feel like their experience was -.

485
01:05:30,502 --> 01:05:35,902
So one thing that happened a lot when I was starting all voices, I would talk to people.

486
01:05:35,902 --> 01:05:42,902
I would talk to HR leaders and lawyer Then sometimes most of the time they were like, this is a great idea.

487
01:05:42,902 --> 01:05:48,202
I love the idea of you know, easily accessible Anonymous reporting and feedback for employees.

488
01:05:48,502 --> 01:05:52,402
It's so needed some people were afraid.

489
01:05:52,902 --> 01:05:54,402
They were afraid.

490
01:05:54,902 --> 01:06:09,502
This was quoted to me many times of opening Pandora's Box because they thought if I let people share anonymously, I am going to get so much negative feedback that I am not even going to be able to handle it.

491
01:06:09,502 --> 01:06:24,202
And then I went to all these people responses and it's going to be really stressful and What's really interesting is I almost never hear that feedback anymore from customers from people and talking to from experts.

492
01:06:25,002 --> 01:06:38,202
I think one thing that's happened is that there has been a major shift over the last five years, in the value that we place on this type of feedback, getting to the people who need to hear it.

493
01:06:38,302 --> 01:06:41,302
So it started with the me to movement, right?

494
01:06:41,402 --> 01:06:51,902
It was like, all of a sudden, it was not an excuse, it was not a good excuse for a company leader to say, oh, I had no idea that was happening, right?

495
01:06:51,902 --> 01:06:55,002
Ignorance was not an out.

496
01:06:55,802 --> 01:07:00,102
People were being held accountable for the things that were happening in their companies.

497
01:07:00,302 --> 01:07:06,702
Whether they knew about them or not, and the only difference is if you know about it, you can do something about it.

498
01:07:06,902 --> 01:07:15,102
So I sometimes use the analogy or like the symbolism of like the ostrich with its head in the sand.

499
01:07:15,102 --> 01:07:20,702
Like you can be the ostrich but you're also not going to know what's actually going on.

500
01:07:20,702 --> 01:07:25,502
You're not going to be aware of reality and that's actually riskier.

501
01:07:25,702 --> 01:07:40,202
Knowing, and so I think having some type of conversation with staff or managers, who are afraid because I would say it's less about having had negative experiences and probably more fear of what's going to come up.

502
01:07:40,802 --> 01:07:51,002
And just tell them, at least if we know what people really feel, at least if we're aware of what's going on and what our employees reality is we can do something about it.

503
01:07:51,202 --> 01:07:55,502
If we don't know, we can't do anything about it and that's a much worse position for us.

504
01:07:55,602 --> 01:07:56,202
Us to be in.

505
01:07:57,802 --> 01:07:59,002
Knowledge is power.

506
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,402
So good.

507
01:08:02,402 --> 01:08:07,702
Wow, Claire, this has been a rich conversation.

508
01:08:08,302 --> 01:08:10,302
I am curious to know.

509
01:08:10,402 --> 01:08:16,301
So one, last question and maybe even point of advice that you would give to all of us here.

510
01:08:17,902 --> 01:08:20,102
How should we, how should we show up?

511
01:08:20,102 --> 01:08:21,502
What do you see for the future?

512
01:08:21,502 --> 01:08:26,902
You know, what are things that we could be doing and implementing today?

513
01:08:27,602 --> 01:08:34,602
In our circumstance, even if it's a mindset shift and you might have just been talking about that, you know what would you advise to us?

514
01:08:34,602 --> 01:08:45,102
Because obviously, people who came here to this event, we care about providing good feedback and making sure that the loops are there.

515
01:08:45,602 --> 01:08:46,801
What do you advise to us?

516
01:08:49,002 --> 01:08:50,301
Yeah, I think.

517
01:08:53,002 --> 01:09:02,402
I think, like I was just talking about, like, starting with this humility that, like, we don't know what, we don't know.

518
01:09:02,602 --> 01:09:20,902
It sounds so obvious, but there's information out there that we aren't aware of that someone has not felt comfortable bringing up to us and I think about this every day as a leader, there's definitely stuffed that I don't know about my organization about my team about specific team members, right?

519
01:09:21,301 --> 01:09:22,102
I just don't know.

520
01:09:22,402 --> 01:09:31,301
So the More that I can show up to make people feel comfortable, giving me that information sharing that feedback doing it in real time.

521
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:35,102
Not doing it when it's already too late, and they have already left the organization.

522
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:40,102
The better and, you know, going back to the pool that was shared at the beginning.

523
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:43,902
What's really interesting from what I have seen anecdotally?

524
01:09:43,902 --> 01:09:48,602
People are almost just as scared to share the positive feedback directly.

525
01:09:49,002 --> 01:09:55,402
And if you open up an anonymous Channel, I think you'd be really surprised by the amount of positive feedback.

526
01:09:55,402 --> 01:10:05,902
You will get two people who, for whatever reason, just don't feel safe sharing their opinion at all and the more that you can open up another.

527
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:16,202
Channel, the more you can say like okay I have the feedback that's coming to me directly, I have the feedback that is coming to me through these additional channels.

528
01:10:16,202 --> 01:10:40,302
I really feel like I have a more comprehensive understanding of what's going on with my employees and as a result, I am going to be better able to take care of them to see around corners to anticipate their needs and ultimately to build a healthy culture that really is Logically safe, and inclusive and welcoming for all employees.

529
01:10:42,102 --> 01:10:43,502
Thank you so much, Claire.

530
01:10:44,002 --> 01:10:45,302
We receive that word.

531
01:10:45,302 --> 01:10:47,702
