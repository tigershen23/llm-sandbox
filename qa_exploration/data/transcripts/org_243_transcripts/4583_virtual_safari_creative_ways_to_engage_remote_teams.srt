00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,000
Hello everyone.

2
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Welcome to a virtual Safari and an awesome panel.

3
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,200
We're going to talk a little bit about how we're going to team build during these hybrid remote times.

4
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,700
So let us see here.

5
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,900
We got people all over the nation here.

6
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,800
Hi Ashley, d.c.

7
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,200
Chicago.

8
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,100
Wow, Callie, New Hampshire Toronto.

9
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,100
I saw Puerto Rico, New York City, Texas.

10
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,300
Hello everybody.

11
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,600
We're so happy to have you here.

12
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,500
So before we jump in, Just note some housekeeping, we have got obviously you see the chat and there's Q&A.

13
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,300
So throughout this entire time at any given moment.

14
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,600
If you have got a question a burning question, please drop it in Q&A.

15
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
And if you got any Tech issues, there's a little help tab right there as well.

16
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,300
Okay, let us Jump Right In.

17
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,000
I have got my virtual Safari shirt on, are you guys have your virtual Safari game?

18
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,100
There's like a little elephant somewhere over here.

19
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,500
Vegas, what's up?

20
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,600
I am in Vegas, too.

21
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,700
Okay, let us kick it off with a pole.

22
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,200
So Joshua, he's my producer in The Green Room.

23
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,500
Hello, Josh, you all can't see him, but I can thank you for pulling that pull up.

24
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,400
All right, have any of you been on a safari?

25
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,100
This is in real life or virtual.

26
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,600
Wow.

27
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

28
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,100
I haven't either.

29
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,400
I haven't done a virtual Safari yet.

30
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,000
So this is going to be a fun experience.

31
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,900
Stan yell, you know what?

32
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,200
You want to go on one so bad.

33
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,400
We're gonna go on a virtual one together today.

34
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,600
It's going to be great.

35
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,400
All right.

36
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:53,300
So with that, I would love to introduce our partners on the panel today, Suman from Marco experiences and Aaron from Bonus, Lee.

37
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,400
Would you join me on stage?

38
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,000
Hallo.

39
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,900
Hey everyone.

40
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,900
Hello.

41
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,500
Hello.

42
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,100
Well II am so blessed to have you graced our stage, both of you.

43
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:17,300
It's wonderful to be with you all before we jump into talking about some really cool team building ideas because I know each of you have golden insights to share with us.

44
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,600
Let us go in with some fun facts.

45
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,300
So fun facts, right?

46
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,800
All right, so fun facts.

47
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,400
Just about me is that, when I was early in my twenties way, back in the day.

48
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,400
I was on Ugly.

49
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:30,800
Betty.

50
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,300
Believe it or not and 7th Heaven and see.

51
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,200
Yes, I did.

52
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Adam Sandler movies back in the day.

53
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,700
So yeah, that's my fun fact.

54
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,400
I am going to hand it over to you Suman.

55
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,900
What's your fun?

56
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,100
Fact fun fact is I have a twin brother.

57
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,000
His name is Vig.

58
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,400
He's on the west coast, the better-looking twin as you can see in this photo here with this beautiful dog that I am embracing.

59
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,300
So as my fun fact, very cool.

60
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,400
Aaron.

61
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,700
Your fun fact.

62
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:05,200
A fun fact is one of my tweets made it into an Atlantic article ton of high C codes had been learning French.

63
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,200
Each and he asked if anyone could explain the subjunctive tense, very cool.

64
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,300
And I am super curious about how to cook objective.

65
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,300
That's good.

66
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, both of you have some really interesting insights around creative team, building ideas, and just things that you have been implementing with your companies and with your own teams.

67
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:43,600
And so before we jump into that though, can each of you just tell us a little bit about like Marco and even bonus lie, What are you guys seeing as, like, really interesting trends of your customers and I will start off Aaron with you?

68
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:44,900
Yes.

69
00:07:44,900 --> 00:08:02,400
Well, I think bonus lead is the perfect app for, you know, the times that we have in remote work and everything like that because it really encourages engagement and recognition and it really brings employees together and you don't necessarily have to be in the same room.

70
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, I will hop in so Marco.

71
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,600
I guess the trend is where our company is literally focused all around connectivity in a more distributed kind of flexible world.

72
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,500
So Marco, I am the CEO and co-founder of Marco.

73
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:33,299
We cultivate culture and connection through extraordinary experiences virtual and person off sites, but really excited to be sharing kind of one of our virtual host today with you and talking all about how we think about Marco and how we build our own distributed team, which is kind of all over the world.

74
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,600
So Very cool.

75
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,299
Thank you for sharing.

76
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,400
So, Aaron just go on, talking about your own team right now?

77
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,000
You are a people leader of an engineering team.

78
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,800
And over this pandemic.

79
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,100
You have identified some really cool ways to keep your team connected and interacting.

80
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,700
What are some of those things?

81
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,200
Well, whenever I started as an engineering manager, we were all pretty new to each other.

82
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:09,500
So, the first thing I did was created an about me page is basically a page online that, you know, I feel about questions.

83
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:16,400
Like, where did I grow up how to support me at work or, you know, how I prefer to get positive and negative feedback.

84
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,000
And, so I filled that page out but I also asked my team to fill those out, too.

85
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
So it's been very helpful.

86
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,400
Very cool.

87
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,200
What platform or how do you guys?

88
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:34,600
Fed up, you just put up a WordPress page or, you know, we actually use Confluence as a tool for documentation.

89
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,500
And in our space, we put it in.

90
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,900
Very nice.

91
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,900
Okay, and what are some other tactics?

92
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,600
I mean you were mentioning a few of them?

93
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:57,100
Well, I think the first thing I did that really helped the most was done a Clifton strengths finder survey of strengths finder, by the way, it's great.

94
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,100
We all talked about what we were good at and, you know, that actually informed our about me pages to.

95
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,500
And we talked about what the team was good at collectively and You know, we have a cross-functional team.

96
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,700
So our team includes members of design and product.

97
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,000
So, you know, generally the engineers were very analytical.

98
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,300
They have very analytical strengths in our design and product Partners had great relational strength.

99
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,200
So that kind of balance the team out.

100
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,800
That's great.

101
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,500
I could speak to the strings fine.

102
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,900
I have been using with various teams for last 10 years and it is awesome.

103
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,500
It's a really fun team building opportunity to when you bring in a coach.

104
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,200
I have done it virtually with our team as well.

105
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:52,100
And we hired a coach to come in, and we had everyone take their strengths finder prior to the coach coming in and I created an Excel doc that just Maps out the top-10 strengths of each of the team members.

106
00:10:52,300 --> 00:11:06,600
And then we started to analyze Eyes as a team and have a really healthy discussion of our strengths and you know where we default to in times of great stress or Joy or flow, you know what I am saying?

107
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,900
So it really helped us a ton Suman.

108
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,800
How about you all your Marcos?

109
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,700
Also, remote team.

110
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:19,400
I mean, of course you guys are the pro experiences, but how are you keeping your own teams engaged?

111
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,700
Yeah, I mean so our team is in New York, San Francisco.

112
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,700
AOL a Seattle, Miami Atlanta in the Philippines, and we're subbed 20 people.

113
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,600
So we're quite distributed.

114
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,200
I think one, there's a couple of themes that I would touch on one, is just proactivity.

115
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,100
So we create for ourselves as well as for our customers, what we call, like a culture calendar.

116
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,300
So instead of just being reactive and saying, oh my gosh, we haven't seen each other in a while.

117
00:11:43,400 --> 00:12:08,300
How do we actually create a way for folks to look forward to meeting whether it's kind of virtually more frequently in person less frequently, and we talked a lot about intentionality of So one of the interesting things that both of y'all touched on which is experiences can be fun, which is we're going to have fun today on this virtual Safari, but they can also be meaningful and really provide an opportunity to get to know one another and allow us to kind of do our best work.

118
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:14,800
So, even today instead of a normal team meeting, we're doing something called the super story, which is a friend Sarah runs.

119
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:22,700
It's kind of similar to the strengthsfinder exercise, but it's really about who you are your life thread and kind of your new your unique powers, your super story.

120
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,200
And so Experience is its a new experience since it will be on our platform soon.

121
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,800
But those are opportunities where you can really understand, like, who is Aaron, for example, get to know her.

122
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
Why is she?

123
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,600
What is she motivated by?

124
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:43,100
And I think if you think about why we do experiences, it's really, so we can provide that context and I think it allows us to do our best work.

125
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,500
So that's how we kind of approach it in our team.

126
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,300
So I love that.

127
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,300
And so far just the common theme of what I am hearing, just the for the initial team building.

128
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,500
Idea, you know, is really their exercises that help one.

129
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,000
Another get to know each other at another level.

130
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,400
I mean we can have amazing safaris happy hours and all these things.

131
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:14,700
But at the end of the day if we're not feeling that connection and deeper understanding of one, another than those things aren't as meaningful.

132
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:23,700
So can each of you speak to that a little bit of just like how you have been able to create some of those deeper connections.

133
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:31,400
And, you know, I think we're missing out with the in-person water cooler like bum pins and, you know, all the way to the kitchen.

134
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,100
Hey, want to grab some coffee?

135
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,900
Like we missed that these days.

136
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,300
So, how are each of you accomplishing that within your team's today?

137
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,300
Yeah, I can, I can jump it.

138
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:49,500
I think one important thing is, we're living in a world that's been pretty crazy for the past two years.

139
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,600
And even now there's another outbreak of covid or a geopolitical kind of Crisis.

140
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,000
And one thing is just acknowledging the stress that people are going through.

141
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,700
And there's this concept of bringing your whole self to work and just allowing for a space where you can talk about mental health.

142
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:14,400
You can talk about how you're stressed out whether that's kind of your personal life or your work life, and I think creating the Safe spaces, and you can do that through experiences.

143
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,000
You can just do that through a check in and whether it's, you know, through report and saying, hey look like how are you doing?

144
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,500
Maybe we take a moment to breathe together, that sort of thing.

145
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I think is really impactful and allows folks to open up when they might not be able to you know on board and meet everyone.

146
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,000
Now, they can provide a safe space to kind of get to know one another in a real way.

147
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,700
I think so good.

148
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,500
I completely agree with that.

149
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
How about you Aaron?

150
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,800
Well, I think I, once I read a study that mentions that parallel communication or side-by-side communication Foster's cooperation.

151
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,900
And it also Fosters's more intimacy than when you sit across from each other.

152
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,400
So it's kind of like a sports team.

153
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,600
You face your opponent and your next to your teammate.

154
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:03,400
And what we, what I do a lot is play video games actually, so we have to coordinate.

155
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
We're kind of team.

156
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:19,800
There's a lot of (Mario) Kart a lot of jackbox games, but Yeah, I think that kind of breaks down the barrier of defensiveness or self-consciousness, and then, you know, it creates a little bit more of a Teen Spirit.

157
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,400
I love that and we're seeing some folks.

158
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,300
Drop some insight Samantha.

159
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:32,600
I completely agree that it's on the leaders and managers to set the tone MJ looks like you agree with that too.

160
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:41,800
And I think that's, that's really important as people leaders and managers that, you know, were able to maintain Suman.

161
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:49,300
Some of what you're talking about that empathy during times such as this were, there's uncertainty, and some volatility.

162
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:56,200
Even how do we Continue to keep that balance of vulnerability to those things?

163
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:03,700
Yet also strength and resilience, you know, it's such a fine line of a balance, but I believe it can be done.

164
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:14,600
Yeah, I think going on what Aaron said, providing kind of talking about, a lot of Studies have been published recently McKinsey published a study in September about kind of the great resignation.

165
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,600
One of the things they found was one of the biggest reasons why people are leaving their jobs is because they don't have a sense of belonging.

166
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,100
Longing.

167
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:27,600
And, so I think investing in creating that sense of belonging is actually super, super important.

168
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,100
It actually provides business results.

169
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:45,400
So I think people sometimes think about events and experiences which we're doing now and it's kind of it can be a Band-Aid and just kind of something that you need to do, but I think approaching it with a different mindset with intentionality and saying, oh, how do I actually Foster a connection belonging and also still maintaining kind of strong business results in strength.

170
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,500
And that balance that you mentioned Gina is super effective important.

171
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,200
Yes, love that.

172
00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:00,100
And as far as the strengthsfinder, it's a great tool to help you get to know the team members.

173
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,300
Now.

174
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,200
It's only a tool.

175
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,400
All these things were talking about experiences, even strengths finder.

176
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:14,800
If you don't use those insights to actually get to know your team, spend the time, get in the trenches with them, ask the hard questions and really engage with them.

177
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,000
Then none of these tools and experiences mean anything.

178
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:27,700
So I think to your point see you in about Belonging like how that's ultimately like I think of Maslow's hierarchy of needs that's like the Pinnacle right?

179
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,500
Of having everyone feel that outcome.

180
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:41,300
But there's some basic layers of things that we can provide our team members to get to that sense of belonging on a daily basis.

181
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,600
Totally thoughts to that.

182
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,700
Yeah.

183
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,700
I mean, I think the, there's actually two me.

184
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,500
I feel people are really stressed, and it's been kind of challenging couple of years.

185
00:17:52,500 --> 00:18:01,300
I will be the first to acknowledge, that's been the case for me, but I think the opportunity we have now is to rethink our relationship with life and work.

186
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:07,600
And so there's this opportunity to actually reset and hopefully we can emerge from this time and say, well, what do I actually?

187
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,000
I mean, I spend a lot of time at work, how do I, you know, get the most out of it?

188
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:21,400
And how do we Structure kind of you know, the Cadence and frequency and kind of how we all kind of show up and connect them with one another to where it's actually positive.

189
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:31,900
And, so I am actually super excited about kind of the future in the next few years and the like, we now have a lot of flexibility, but how do we maintain that flexibility?

190
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
But still retain this connectivity.

191
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,800
We can do that virtually.

192
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,000
We, that person we can do that.

193
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,400
A bunch of different ways, but that's, I think the natural tension the challenge, but also kind of the opportunity that we have.

194
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,100
Love that.

195
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,000
And just a tack on to the idea of belonging.

196
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,400
There's actually a framework called biceps and belonging is the be and biceps.

197
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:59,300
So it's sort of being includes like equality or Equity, predictability, significance and things like that.

198
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:09,800
So I think that, you know, factoring all of those factors into sort of building a team or creating a culture on the team can really help.

199
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
That is nice.

200
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,700
So biceps like that.

201
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,000
Could you drop that in chat for us so that we can see what you have is the acronyms?

202
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,500
That's pretty powerful there.

203
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So we got it some of the deep stuff and that's really the meaningful thing is everything we're talking about right now.

204
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:49,400
It's that over communication connecting its vulnerability, you know, really it engages with our team members in times like this and then There's that layer above it of will, there's a fun experiences and video games to amazing virtual safaris.

205
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,600
I mean, with welcome.

206
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,400
We're actually playing with this idea of creating our environment as a cafe.

207
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:12,500
And so we have been doing a cafe on a weekly basis where we invite all of our team members to just hang out, and we have got some nice Lounge music, and we have created the environment to feel very like, bring your coffee cup and on us, you know, kind of moment.

208
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,000
So let us talk a little bit about those creative ideas and experiences.

209
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,500
I know Aaron, you mentioned some Suman.

210
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:26,200
What are you guys doing these days and why are companies pull in from you all?

211
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,900
Well, the cool thing is a bit of a backstory.

212
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,300
I have had traditional careers until this point and now we get to have a lot of fun, right?

213
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:45,400
So I worked in finance prior to Marco and now we're finding new hosts and empowering them to, you know, bring their creative passions to new customers such as the folks here.

214
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,000
And so, just a few.

215
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,300
I mean, by the way, I am all for kind of having fun.

216
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,500
We just had a meeting with our team and everyone put on a different ridiculous hat just for no reason.

217
00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:01,900
And that kind of stuff is like silly, but people, you know, got some smiles and you can just bring a little bit of levity to what is normally kind of perhaps a stressful meeting.

218
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:14,700
But, I mean, just a few in addition to the one that you will see, so I won't cover that one, but there's a brand called Marco ice cream and I found Marco ice cream through a Friend, and they have this kind of global culinary Feast, where they ship you ice cream.

219
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,500
It's delicious.

220
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,100
All the flavors are super interesting.

221
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:28,500
I am actually going to drop Marco ice cream in the chat, but we just love the name because I love Marco obviously, but that kind of stuff is we have the opportunity.

222
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:35,000
Now to Shameless plug, we have the opportunity to go find the founder and say, hey, why don't you do an experience?

223
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,100
Tell everyone about the founding story of Marco ice cream, and they kind of play playlist for each.

224
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,000
Ice cream.

225
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:49,000
And so that's one example, we do everything from kind of plant conversations with this, with this hose called free Plants.

226
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:54,700
Everything that you would think of we get the opportunity to from that the heavy stuff to the super light stuff.

227
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:00,900
We get we have the opportunity to bring those hosts on our platform and allow them to show their passions to the world.

228
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:08,700
So Ryan's asking if every one of us gets a pint of your ice cream there, we should have hit some ice cream.

229
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,100
I think it's the Maybe the next experience event is like will just totally ice cream and ice cream experiment.

230
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,400
Ice cream is absolutely delicious.

231
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,900
And so it's for us was we met we joke with the founders like what a great partnership.

232
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,000
We both love the name worker.

233
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,800
We both love ice cream.

234
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,700
So super fun.

235
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,800
Aaron, are there any other things that your teams are doing?

236
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,500
Yeah, well, obviously we use bonus lie.

237
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,000
So I think that really factors into, you know, feeling of being recognized and rewarded at work.

238
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:47,300
So another thing that we do we have very active slack channels, you know, we have a dog chat cat chat, hiking chat.

239
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,300
Things like that.

240
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,000
Hmm, and that's good.

241
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,700
Yeah.

242
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,700
It's a we try to get together whenever it's safe and also have any person happy hours.

243
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,000
But yeah.

244
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,600
So good.

245
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,700
Alright, let us move right into Q&A because I can see our virtual Safari guy.

246
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,300
Nate is in the green room.

247
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,100
So let us pull up that first question there, Josh.

248
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:22,700
From cat, how do you create a sense of belonging and engagement in the workplace without affecting the employees work-life balance?

249
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,700
Good question, answer that.

250
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:47,900
I think work-life balance has been very important on our team because, you know, it's a time when everybody has a lot of going on outside of work and I think that one of the most important things is to model work-life balance.

251
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:58,200
So things I do, you know, I try not to work late or I tried to get all my work done within business hours.

252
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,300
And if I do work afterwards, I don't think my team on slack.

253
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,500
I usually schedule the messages or, you know, save it for tomorrow.

254
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,200
Yeah, I guess for us.

255
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,800
I think we try to, and we're still working on this boat leading with flexibility.

256
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:26,000
So I actually think that now you might, you know, be in Tahoe and want to take a half-day to go skiing and then work late or work on a And to me, that's completely fine.

257
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So long as the work product is great.

258
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,600
And I think there's also an element of not kind of overreaching.

259
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:41,200
So we started this by talking about, you know, sharing and having the sense of belonging, but also respecting people's boundaries and what they want to keep within their personal life.

260
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,400
They should be able to write.

261
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:49,300
And I think now there's blurred lines between, you know, personal and professional life because everything's working all the time and every can jump on a zoom meeting whatever.

262
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,900
And, so I think just respecting boundaries is super important as well.

263
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,300
I think that's great.

264
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,200
Great points.

265
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,500
There.

266
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,900
Let us jump right into Kylie's.

267
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,700
Question.

268
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,200
Everyone on our staff is completely covered up by workload.

269
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,100
How can we create bonding connectivity when there's no time for activities?

270
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,700
So, I will jump right into this one.

271
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,000
Actually bonus.

272
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,400
Lee has been an amazing tool for our team, as we're cranking on our work and going meeting to meeting at times were able to recognize one another.

273
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,300
In a really easy way.

274
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:33,100
So, all of those recognitions actually go into our values, shoutouts lap Channel, and we're always looking at it.

275
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,500
And then what we do is actually call out those shout outs at our weekly all hands.

276
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:46,700
So we have our All Hands meeting on Friday and part of that run is show is to be able to recognize our team members and some of these things.

277
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:59,900
So, you know, being able to just get the asynchronous mentions and Figuring out where it's appropriate to bring up the synchronous mentions.

278
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
If that makes sense.

279
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,800
Am I think a really good way to cover that?

280
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Any other thoughts.

281
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,800
I guess one thought is for me making the time and prioritizing it from leadership.

282
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:23,900
And so as an example, we have our company Retreat, coming up in May and in previous Retreats, we have actually worked too much and not that enough creative time or kind of fun.

283
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,600
One time.

284
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,700
And it, what I, what I think is those moments in taking the time, actually pays a lot of dividends because it could be easy to say.

285
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,400
Oh my gosh.

286
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,700
I actually have to, you know, let us push the kind of connectivity experience.

287
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,900
And let us instead just focus on creating the slide deck, but I think it ends up creating business value to do this stuff.

288
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,500
If it's done in the right Cadence, right?

289
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,000
It shouldn't overwhelm folks.

290
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,900
That should be done at the right Cadence, but it actually I think will pay dividends for kind of company and kind of business value and showing that from leadership perspective.

291
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,600
Important.

292
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,600
Awesome.

293
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,100
That I think that's right on.

294
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,400
You know, I think yes, we can get overloaded with work, but we need to make time as Leaders as managers.

295
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,300
We have to make time.

296
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,300
If it's an off-site and your team needs that connectivity, fly him out.

297
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,600
It's worth the investment of that focused energy and time whether it's in person or whether it's virtual, so that is right on?

298
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Okay, we're starting to wrap up with time before our safari guide, but we could take one more question.

299
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,400
Shiloh because it's upvoted.

300
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,100
So high.

301
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,300
How can you comfortably include introverts in culture?

302
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,300
Oh, this is a good question.

303
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
I think I have a team of introverts.

304
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,000
I am an introvert myself.

305
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:52,000
So I think going back to that idea of not necessarily having direct engagement or forcing direct engagement with each other.

306
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:03,200
I think that you know, kind of creating a space where people can talk to each other or be as open as they want to be or as create the boundaries that they want to create.

307
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,700
But also, you know, making it very known that You know, Association is possible.

308
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:22,600
It's encouraged whenever you want it and just creating those spaces where we can work as a team together without needing to be in a sort of defensive position.

309
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Yeah, I guess it's funny.

310
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,600
I start off my fun fact because I am a twin brother.

311
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:36,500
My I am a super extrovert as you write tell if you know, I imagine your expert as well, and he's super introvert, so I can kind of challenge have this challenge my entire life.

312
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,500
It's really kind of, I think having respect for how people operate best.

313
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:47,500
I think the cool thing is now in this more distributed World, providing spaces, where introverts can speak up if they, if they want in the right.

314
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:55,800
Setting is perhaps easier because in a purely, we're in a world where you're always in person together the It's might shine, right?

315
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,000
They might be the ones who are always ready to order gold.

316
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,300
So they might only be the ones that are developing on their relationships and extra introverts by not.

317
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,600
So I think creating structuring the space methodically.

318
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,500
I think I totally agree and I think being in a virtual or hybrid circumstance, actually, empowers.

319
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:24,500
Introverts, to be able to chat to be able to ask the questions that normally if the extroverts in person are like overbearingly asking all the questions, they're able to have their voice heard.

320
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:30,700
Hurt in a virtual environment and I agree with Samantha what you said, you know, ask people what they want.

321
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,100
And that's where activities like strengths finder.

322
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,700
And getting to know your team members and how they're wired.

323
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,700
Myers Brigg, Enneagram.

324
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:43,700
All of these personality tests can really help, you get to know your team members and vice versa.

325
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,200
It's important for them to get to you as their leader as well.

326
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,400
So it goes both ways.

327
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,900
Well, these are awesome questions and answers.

328
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,100
Thank you so much.

329
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,500
Sue me.

330
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,700
Aaron for all your insights.

331
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:03,500
We're going to now bring up Nate our virtual Safari guide.

332
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,900
Join me up on stage to urinate.

333
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,800
He's coming up.

334
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
He's coming up.

335
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,400
All right.

336
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,300
Well, if the Beats eyeball waiting for Nate of there you are.

337
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,600
Hello, the flamingos.

338
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,500
Yep.

339
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,300
We're here at the Flamingo Pond.

340
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,100
I love it.

341
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,900
Wow.

342
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,300
So Nate, how long have you been guiding these virtual safaris and maybe in real life safaris as well?

343
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,600
Yeah.

344
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:43,400
Well, I started here at Safari West in, you know back in 2016 and virtual safaris were something.

345
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,800
None of us ever thought of until last year, of course.

346
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:55,800
And you know, it's not been an easy time for any of us, but zoos have a very specific problem in that, their overhead can't go.

347
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,900
Go down, you know, we have animals, we have to feed and care for at all times.

348
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,600
And a lot of that.

349
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,200
We do funded by guest experiences.

350
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:17,800
So when we had no way to bring people to our animals, we decided to bring our animals to them, and that's when we created this virtual Safari program last year.

351
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,900
I love it.

352
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,600
Well, we're all very excited for you to guide us through.

353
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Before we jump into your guide.

354
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,800
We do have a pole So Josh, if you could pull up bar Pole.

355
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,900
What is your favorite animal?

356
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,100
Let us just get a quick feel here to see what everyone's favorite animal is.

357
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,000
I am just going to say my name out loud.

358
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,500
I think I know what my vote would be.

359
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,900
What's yours?

360
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,100
I am glad we started here.

361
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,800
Oh, it's giraffe.

362
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Nice.

363
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,700
All right, what about the elephants?

364
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,100
I have.

365
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,800
We do it.

366
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,500
Tell if it's didn't make it to our poll?

367
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,300
But yeah, it looks like we have got a lot of draft fans and a lot of I love them all fans.

368
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,800
So this is going to be a treat for us.

369
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,100
That is the best answer.

370
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,500
Yeah.

371
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:09,900
All right, cool.

372
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,600
Thank you very much.

373
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,200
So we're going to profile, three animals that live here at Safari West.

374
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,700
Today.

375
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,500
We're starting off strong with a personal favorite of many of you.

376
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,600
It looks like according to our poll, the flamingo.

377
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,600
Now.

378
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
This is a live.

379
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Look right now.

380
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,700
I have got my camera posted right behind us.

381
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,600
Right here, pointed straight into the flamingo habitat.

382
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:42,100
These are African lesser, flamingos a little smaller in stature than the Caribbean, flamingos that you might see down at Florida, certain time.

383
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,400
Of year, but much more vibrantly colored.

384
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,300
Look at those fluorescent legs.

385
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,100
They're absolutely beautiful.

386
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,700
Now, flamingos.

387
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,200
They get their color much the same way.

388
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,000
A lot of bright red birds.

389
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,100
Do they convert beta-carotene in their diet into paint?

390
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,100
Pigment?

391
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,700
A lot of you may have heard that flamingos are pink because Eat.

392
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:35,800
It's a beta carotene and them and their bodies can express that beta-carotene as beautiful pink, that Flamingo sticks, its beak.

393
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:49,600
It's there's a filter inside its peak, the going to catch all of those tiny Christian I mention and that's the way it easy thing else.

394
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:55,400
Except okay.

395
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,600
That their legs appear to bend backward.

396
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,600
Go in the middle of his leg.

397
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
There were it is an ankle.

398
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:23,400
It's not an e, it's an ankle and it's kind of like when you stand on your tiptoes and your heel is right off the ground.

399
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,199
That's like the joint in the middle of their leg.

400
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,600
Yeah, but let us see.

401
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,199
From here.

402
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,199
It looks like we might have some questions coming in.

403
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,900
I can take some questions on flamingos, if anybody's got some.

404
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,199
If not, if we don't have any questions, I can roll right on through to our next animal.

405
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:55,600
Here.

406
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,900
We have another one that I want to feature today.

407
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,900
Its habitat is brand-new.

408
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,300
We just built it.

409
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,700
I will give you a hint.

410
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,400
What they are.

411
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,600
What is the pig with the longest legs in the world?

412
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
It's the warthog.

413
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,000
We have a beautiful habitat that we just built right over here nigiri and her daughter.

414
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,400
Lucy.

415
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Just moved in, and I am going to go ahead and pivot my camera, and we're going to do something really.

416
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,500
Fine, we're going to feed the warthogs together.

417
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,100
So just a moment here.

418
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,700
We're going to Pivot the camera.

419
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,300
All right.

420
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,100
There's our habitat.

421
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,700
We're going to head right over to that fence, and we're going to try to feed some warthogs today.

422
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,800
A big help.

423
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,600
They're going to move to the other side for me.

424
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,800
All right, here are our beautiful warthogs.

425
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,100
Again.

426
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:33,700
This is nigiri and Lucy right here mother-daughter pair, and we're going to step right up to the fence here.

427
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,800
We're going to feed them together.

428
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,000
Hey ladies.

429
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,300
Are you a little frightened?

430
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,300
Let us bring it back over with some of their favorite treats here.

431
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,700
We have got some romaine lettuce, which is an absolute favorite of theirs.

432
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,800
Nigerien Lucy.

433
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Only moved into this habitat about a month and a half ago.

434
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,800
Previously.

435
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,100
They were living back off stage another out front and center where I guess can come and see them.

436
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,800
You guys back for some tasty treats?

437
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,300
There we go.

438
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,200
One of the things that makes warthogs different from other.

439
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,400
Pigs is a Tusk where hogs have these big gigantic tusks.

440
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,700
You can see them right here.

441
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,300
They are modified teeth.

442
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:32,100
That grow way out of the sides of the mouth, that can be used to defend themselves from big predators.

443
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:46,000
They are one of the fastest members of the hog family top speed on these little warthogs is about 35 miles per hour, which I know blew my mama, and when I first heard it, because that's just crazy fast.

444
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,000
They are.

445
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,300
Well fast enough to get away from things that might want to eat them, which is a really important thing for him.

446
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,900
Oh, hi Lucy.

447
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,900
I am glad you guys warmed up to me.

448
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,700
There, you made me nervous for a second.

449
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:02,800
Now.

450
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,100
One reason.

451
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:15,300
I always feel the need to stand up for the warthog, is I think they get a pretty bad reputation as being animals, that are not cleaned and I don't know why people look down on them for this.

452
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,000
Yes, they spend all day rolling around in the mud.

453
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,900
But you might do, if you were a hog.

454
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,600
You see members of the hog and pig family.

455
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,200
One thing that makes them all similar is that they Cannot.

456
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,500
They're very, very happy with their new home over here.

457
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:55,300
And if they will stay by the fence, I will come back to my station here and see if we got any questions coming through.

458
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,300
All right.

459
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,200
I will look at those adorable pigs.

460
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,100
Lucy and particular is very energetic.

461
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:07,700
You guys might notice.

462
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,700
They have a sort of Moe.

463
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:43,600
All together, I think they deserve a little more credit than they get who do parents and children separate or do they stay together their whole life, you know that the female Offspring will stick around with the family for a while.

464
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,300
The male offspring will typically go out and do their own saying once they reach adulthood.

465
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,600
So yeah, great question.

466
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,500
Thank you, Kylie.

467
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,400
All right, let us get over here.

468
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,100
Elizabeth I am glad the Lion King's is popular in your house as it is in mind.

469
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,200
Love that movie.

470
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,900
Absolutely Lucy.

471
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,900
Where'd you go here?

472
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,400
Let me get her back on camera.

473
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,800
Oh, Lucy went and hid behind a tree, but we can get her mom.

474
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,600
This is nigiri.

475
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,800
She's beautiful too.

476
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,800
Let us get nice and close.

477
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,200
Now nigiri and Lucy are going to get a neighbor very soon.

478
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,800
In the next couple of weeks.

479
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:33,300
I Love Lucy to Colleen and that new neighbor is going to be our male warthog, whose name is pig Nuit.

480
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:40,900
I wish I could show you guys him today, but sadly, he still lives backstage, and he's getting introduced to the new habitat and very, very soon.

481
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,900
I know great name, right?

482
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,500
Yeah.

483
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,800
The girls came out here first, and they're doing great.

484
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,300
They absolutely love it.

485
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,100
That what they really love is they have a lot of new neighbors, you know.

486
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:56,800
Backstage.

487
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,200
It was just warthog town.

488
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,700
But out here they live next to a lot of really neat creatures.

489
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:15,600
One of their neighbors being The giraffe, some of my personal favorites.

490
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,500
The giraffe now.

491
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,100
Did you guys enjoy feeding the warthogs with me?

492
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:20,800
Was that fun?

493
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,900
Cool, would you guys like to do the same with the giraffe right now?

494
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,300
Awesome.

495
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:28,800
Okay.

496
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,300
I have got some of our giraffes favorite food, leaves of the acacia tree.

497
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,500
I have a very large bundle of it actually.

498
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,200
And we're going to go see if we can get their attention.

499
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,700
Alright.

500
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,700
Hey everybody.

501
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,300
I got your favorite snack.

502
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,900
Let us see here.

503
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,000
Oh, well, hi there.

504
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,900
This is little o.

505
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,100
Be obese about a year and a half.

506
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,500
Two years old.

507
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And this is little baby Leon.

508
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,800
Who's not a baby anymore?

509
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,200
Guys.

510
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,700
She's got to be close to two now as well.

511
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:27,500
And I am you have got to see me next to them.

512
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:27,800
Right?

513
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,100
For one and two year olds.

514
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,300
These are gigantic giraffe are never small.

515
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:37,700
At any point in the life cycle, giraffe are born, six feet tall and about 100 pounds.

516
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:46,700
They are huge gigantic enormous babies and their wobbly little things, but they usually up and walking in about 30 minutes or less.

517
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,700
For their born.

518
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,900
And then after that, you may have guessed.

519
00:42:51,900 --> 00:43:00,300
They almost double in size and the first year Gotta Be This Tall making me feel real short over here.

520
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,300
Now again, we do have their favorite food over here.

521
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,600
These are leaves of the acacia tree.

522
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,500
We grow this here at Safari West because we know how much the giraffe love it.

523
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,000
Of course, you know, we have about 900 animals here.

524
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,700
We can't grow enough on our 400 Acres, defeat everything.

525
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,500
But as many of their favorite treats that we can grow.

526
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,500
We do try to hear that guys.

527
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,200
Look at that tongue.

528
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,400
Did you guys know that the giraffe has a tongue?

529
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,900
That is almost an inch long for every foot tall that they are?

530
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,900
That means a full-grown giraffe at you know, 15 to 18 feet.

531
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,300
Tall has a tongue that is 15 to 18 inches long.

532
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,800
It is also prehensile, which means they can wrap it around things and pick them up.

533
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,500
Kind of like you're seeing them do with our branches here.

534
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,100
We want another one.

535
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,600
I am still chewing up there.

536
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,500
Something that's always blown.

537
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,100
My mind is the number of bones that the giraffe has in its neck.

538
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,500
You may know this, but human beings us, we have seven vertebrae in our neck.

539
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:08,200
That these little bone discs, that hold our spine together and shockingly, enough giraffe have the same.

540
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,200
Number giraffe, also have seven vertebrae in their neck.

541
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,800
Only, whereas ours are these little bone discs.

542
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,200
There's are these giant Antic phone logs.

543
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,700
Well, it looks like we might have a third coming to join us.

544
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,700
This is tarah over here.

545
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,300
Hey, Tara, how we do?

546
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,100
Would you like a snack?

547
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,800
We're going to think about it.

548
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,300
We're actually doing this a little bit special.

549
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,500
I am not sure if you notice they're a little hesitant.

550
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,900
We have actually not done giraffe meetings in this location before.

551
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,100
But special for our presentation today.

552
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:56,900
We thought we'd try this out and at least a little one, the one and two year, olds seem to be enjoying the new spot over here.

553
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:04,000
I should mention, the giraffe has one of the largest hearts of any land mammal on planet Earth.

554
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,300
A giraffe heart is on average.

555
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,800
Around 25 pounds, which is absolutely gigantic.

556
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,300
But there's a good reason, it's that big.

557
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,900
What is the hearts main job.

558
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,900
It's pumping blood throughout the body and particularly from the chest to the brain on this animal.

559
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,800
That's a distance of six to seven feet.

560
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,000
That's a big job.

561
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
That requires a very big heart and that's part of the reason why the drafts heart is as large as it is.

562
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,700
Alright, I am going to try to stick some of these in the fence here.

563
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,400
Keep them occupied and step back to you guys and get some more questions here.

564
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,800
Let us just make sure they get plenty of snacks because they certainly deserve it.

565
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,200
They have been great.

566
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,800
All right.

567
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,800
Excellent.

568
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,100
All right.

569
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,000
Okay, it looks like we did have some questions role in first one.

570
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,100
I am seeing here Colleen would like to like me to explain the nubbins.

571
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,600
If you're referring to the little things that stick up out of the top of the giraffe's head.

572
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,000
Those are called ossicones.

573
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,400
And you know what I should do zoom out just a little bit.

574
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So you guys are seeing them.

575
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,100
Let us see here.

576
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,900
There we go.

577
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,300
That probably ought to do it.

578
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,300
There we go.

579
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,400
So the giraffe has a horn like structure that sticks up out of the top of their head.

580
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,300
It is called a gnostic own, which is a word.

581
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,000
I didn't know.

582
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:56,700
Before I started working here, six years ago, but also cones are like a horn, but they're covered in skin and fur giraffe.

583
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,700
Were one of only two animals on the planet that have them.

584
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,500
The other one being called the Okapi, lesser-known forest, animal.

585
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,400
That comes from like deep in the Congo rainforest.

586
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,100
Now.

587
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,200
What are they useful for?

588
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,100
Have you ever seen a giraffe bike with one another?

589
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,200
If you haven't it's absolutely wild.

590
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,600
It's called necking to giraffe.

591
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,300
Will walk up side by side.

592
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:35,600
They will press the sides of their bodies against each other, and they will swing their heads in next to each other, as hard as they can use their head, almost like a wrecking ball to strike one another and that's as far as we know what they're useful for.

593
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,700
Now along with that, I always love to mention this fighting style might be.

594
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,200
Why giraffe or so Tall part of me.

595
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,900
If you grew up like me in school, you learned that giraffe or tall to eat leaves from the tallest trees.

596
00:47:51,700 --> 00:48:02,600
Well, that might not be the reason you know, the funny thing about animal Science Biology is that the new research comes out every single year and everything?

597
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,000
We learn about one animal changes, what we thought we might have known about another.

598
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:15,800
So a few years back, biologists noticed this really cool Critter called the gerenuk and the gerenuk are an antelope that has learned to stand on.

599
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,100
Its hind legs to reach higher.

600
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:28,300
Branches in a tree not as tall a branch is a giraffe but still higher branches by standing on hind legs if that's something that's possible for a four-legged animal.

601
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:34,800
Why then would the giraffe develop a 6-foot neck Instead, This one seemed easier than the other.

602
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,300
So we don't For sure, but it led us to start questioning.

603
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:44,900
Could there be another reason why the giraffe has such a long neck and that fighting style might be it?

604
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,900
You see male giraffe fight over taxes to female giraffe by swinging their necks it each other.

605
00:48:50,400 --> 00:49:03,500
If that's the case, doesn't it stand to reason that the Giraffe with the longest, strongest neck might win the most fights and if that's the case, wouldn't the Giraffe with the longest neck produce the most Offspring every generation.

606
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,900
Maybe that's why giraffe are so tall.

607
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,300
Or maybe it's the eating leaves from trees thing.

608
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,600
Or maybe it's a third thing.

609
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,200
That some young person today will grow up to learn about them to be teaching.

610
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:13,700
All of us.

611
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,200
One day.

612
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,400
That's the fun thing about studying animals.

613
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,000
Let us see.

614
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,800
Oh Ryan, you nailed it.

615
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,400
Ossicones right there in the chat.

616
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:23,900
Thank you.

617
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,100
Let us see.

618
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,300
Alexandria.

619
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,300
Okapi, babies are the cutest things I have ever seen.

620
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,100
They are great.

621
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,700
Danielle do asks a great question.

622
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,800
Do they sleep standing up?

623
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,100
Yes, director.

624
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,200
Do sleep standing up, can they sleep sitting down?

625
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,100
Sure, they can but it puts him in a really vulnerable position.

626
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:59,600
Giraffe takes so long to exit a seated position that if a lion comes Upon A seated giraffe that giraffes in really big trouble, right then and there but giraffe are capable of sleeping standing up.

627
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,400
So in most cases, that's what they're going to do because that's what safer.

628
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,700
All right.

629
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,100
Boo, and it looks like MJ managed to share some footage of giraffe necking.

630
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,200
Thank you so much for that.

631
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,600
It's always great to have a visual representation.

632
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,500
And sure Danielle.

633
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,800
You can keep calling them nubbins.

634
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,600
That's fine.

635
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,700
How did they not get tired sleeping?

636
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,100
No one's ever asked me that question.

637
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,300
That's a good question actually.

638
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,900
All right, cool.

639
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,300
Well while we're here, I am just going to share a couple more my favorite giraffe facts with you guys.

640
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,900
And if you have any other questions, please feel free to put them in the chat here.

641
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,200
One thing I always love to share is that the giraffe can kick tremendously hard.

642
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,900
If you just have what we did to go off of, you would probably consider the giraffe a gentle giant.

643
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,100
And for the most part.

644
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,300
They really are, but just like any other animal that's life is threatened.

645
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,000
The fight or flight response kicks in, and they're fast.

646
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,900
They can run like 35 miles per hour.

647
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,700
So maybe flight is the option but if fighting is the option, the giraffe delivers a kick.

648
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:08,400
So powerful that if it kicks a lion in the head, it will not just kill that lion.

649
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:13,700
It could very well shatter that Lion's skull which is just wild.

650
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,400
So don't ever think the giraffes a pushover.

651
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,300
They can take some pretty serious predators in a fight.

652
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,000
Now, let us see.

653
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,100
Jade asks, how do we tell them apart?

654
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,300
Great question.

655
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,500
Frankly.

656
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,100
It's because we have been spending so much time with them.

657
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,000
I mean, for one every giraffe has a unique spot pattern.

658
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,800
No, two are alike.

659
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,200
They're like human fingerprints.

660
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:43,200
So if you have a favorite giraffe, you could sort of memorize what its pattern looks like, for example, we have a giraffe that's got one.

661
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:50,100
Perfect heart-shaped spot on her butt, and we know that one is Kasia because of that.

662
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:50,700
Spot.

663
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,200
Now unfortunately, she's hanging out in the barn today.

664
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,500
So I can't show you guys her right now.

665
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:02,500
But yeah, if you have got a favorite spot, look for easily or a favorite drop, look for easily identifiable spots and that's a great way to figure out.

666
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,700
Who's who Samantha asks.

667
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,300
What is my favorite part of my job?

668
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,800
What I just did with you guys feeding the giraffe.

669
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,300
It is the most fun.

670
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:18,400
I think they're the most fascinating animals and I love getting to share my favorite things about them with folks, like you.

671
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,000
So that's probably my favorite thing.

672
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,400
Alicia asks, are they Anjali?

673
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,600
It's and have a modified me, it acts like a shelf allows for standing for long periods of time.

674
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,400
So yes, you know, I can't speak to the knee thing as much.

675
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,100
I am not quite sure how that works.

676
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,700
But yeah, you are, right.

677
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:39,300
They are Anjali.

678
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,700
It's and it sounds like you might know better than me how their knees works.

679
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,700
So, thank you for sharing that with the group.

680
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,100
What is the life expectancy of a giraffe?

681
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,000
We're talking about 18 years ish in the wild.

682
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,900
Longer under human care.

683
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:57,700
Our oldest giraffe right now is jamala, and she's about 26, and she's by no means a record breaker.

684
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,800
I think the oldest one in the United States right now is 31.

685
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,200
Alright from Pom-Pom.

686
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,000
How much do they eat in a day?

687
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,300
It's a lot.

688
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:15,000
I mean, they grow to what, like to 3,000 pounds by eating nothing but a beliefs that takes a lot of leaves.

689
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,500
I don't have a number on a deck.

690
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,300
Really?

691
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,100
How many pounds of food they eat a day?

692
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,300
I know our Rhino seat about 100 pounds of food every day, and I can't imagine.

693
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,800
It's nearly that much but it's a large number.

694
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,500
Let us see.

695
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,100
So, if the giraffe has a gnarly kick, would it be more dangerous for you to be in the warthog area or the De rap area?

696
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,600
That is an interesting question Jade.

697
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:45,300
It's probably going to be it depends on the individual, you know, just like in terms of people.

698
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:52,700
There's people that are a little bit, you know, shorter tempered, then others with animals.

699
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,700
There are some that are shorter temper than others.

700
00:53:54,700 --> 00:54:01,900
So if it's my choice between a friendly giraffe and a grumpy War Of course, I want to be out with the friendly giraffe.

701
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,300
If it's the other way around, then I want to be in the other habitat there.

702
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,400
So tricky question to answer.

703
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,400
I think it all would have to come down to the individuals temperament.

704
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,000
Not necessarily the species.

705
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,400
How much sleep do they need?

706
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,600
Not a lot, not a lot of sleep.

707
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,900
The in the wild.

708
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,200
They think they spent roughly 15 to 20 hours a day, eating and foraging.

709
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,300
That does not leave a lot of time.

710
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,200
I am left over for Sleep who names them.

711
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:37,900
Their Keepers, do the folks that you know, help them, give birth folks that feed them every day.

712
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,500
The folks that help them with vet care.

713
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,500
If they need it.

714
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:45,200
The ones that are here holidays weekends, all this time.

715
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,500
Making sure they're happy and healthy.

716
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:51,100
They definitely are in the right to name them and that's who gets to, alright.

717
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,700
Colleen will stick with flamingos.

718
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,800
All right, fair enough.

719
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,400
Well, thank you guys so much for your questions.

720
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:04,500
I had an absolutely great time showing you three of my favorite animals here.

721
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,500
I hope you enjoyed getting to feed them with me.

722
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,200
It's a lot of fun for me.

723
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,900
I hope it was a lot of fun for you.

724
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,100

Really appreciate it.

732
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,200
All right.
