1
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,400
Wait and Oahu to be specific.

2
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,600
Ewa Beach and it's 10:47.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,300
A.m.

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,200
What time is it for you?

5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:35,900
It is 347 right now and I got to say it's pretty amazing that we're on opposite ends of the Earth basically, right?

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,800
And we're having a conversation here on welcome, it's kind of crazy when you think about it.

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,200
Just like sometimes when you think about technology, we tend to take it for granted but I think, I don't know.

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,800
Some comedian.

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,400
I heard on Late Show one time, and he was like, you know, isn't it kind of crazy?

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Like you're in an airplane you're in a like a metal cylinder, just flying through the air.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,200
It's a crazy concept.

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,100
Don't think about stuff like that.

13
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,200
We don't think in depth about that, you know, you kind of just like, oh yeah, it's just a bullet train.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:12,100
That's going 200 miles 42 mph when your machine gun send in Japan or in an airplane.

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,100
Yeah, totally.

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:13,700
So, yeah.

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,800
Being on, welcome and being able to connect in completely different time zones across the globe.

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,000
It's pretty awesome.

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:23,900
Yeah.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,700
For sure, it blows my mind sometimes.

21
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,700
Yeah.

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,300
Yeah.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,600
Talking about mind-blowing topics.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,600
I am really excited Jerry to be able to pick your Noggin.

25
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:51,100
You know, your big Noggins is like part of your friend, which I love, but really pick your brain on how you're observing the trends that are taking place in the economy, you know, feds recently, increase interest rates and all that kind of stuff.

26
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,200
Elon Musk, Twitter getting layoffs, layoffs, left, and right and Tech.

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,500
We're going to talk about those things.

28
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:09,600
But before we jump into some of those topics would love to learn a little bit more about just you and your background as a serial founding entrepreneur.

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,800
So can you like let us rewind, I think it's way back.

30
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,600
Like, like back the sure Blackstreet how far?

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,900
How far back do you want me to go?

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,400
When did you where were you born?

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,200
And then when did you migrate to the states?

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,500
Yes, I was born in fishing Village in China called Ningbo.

35
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,500
And when I say Village, it's a city of about 5 million people, right?

36
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,400
But that's basically what a village in China is these days.

37
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:50,300
So I was born there in the 80s and then I moved to the United States when I was 5 years old from there, I lived in Columbus, Ohio.

38
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:58,500
And then, I guess the first formative event in my life as it relates to, my career happened in the late 90s.

39
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,200
When my dad actually got a job in Silicon Valley, as part of the first.com, boom, and subsequent bust.

40
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,100
So, that's when I started to get interested in technology went to school in California.

41
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:19,500
In the Bay Area, went to college at Cal, graduated had my first job at Lockheed Martin, which is a defense contractor.

42
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,000
And that's where I also met Roberto.

43
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,900
My current co-founder here at welcome.

44
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:30,200
And I think ever since I was young Was interested in entrepreneurship.

45
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,200
I was interested in technology, and so I always wanted to start a company.

46
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,300
I always wanted to be at the Forefront of innovation and I made the leap.

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,700
When I saw Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone for the first time I was like, wow this is a pretty revolutionary piece of technology.

48
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:56,500
I was actually very amazed when he first unveiled in 2008, and my first company was an app company.

49
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,600
I made a fantasy Sports.

50
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:12,000
App for mobile phones later, I sold that to Yahoo and that's where Roberto and I work for a little while, so stay there for a couple of years and then Roberto and I decided to work together after that, as well.

51
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,300
He what?

52
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,600
That's where he met, you, I believe in Colorado, and I moved to Colorado at that point.

53
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,700
And we started welcome about two years ago so that's brings us too today.

54
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,300
Wow.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,100
And, you know, you just mentioned a See at, but that's actually like the fantasy football app that was sold to Yahoo right.

56
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,400
Huge.

57
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,700
That's right, there's fantasy football, but I also supported a bunch of other sports as well.

58
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,700
Like my personal favorite sport is basketball.

59
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,100
So I didn't play too much football played a lot of fantasy basketball though.

60
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,300
Very cool.

61
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,000
Wow.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,700
What a journey.

63
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,100
So, here you are today with welcome, you're one of three founders.

64
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,100
So it's you.

65
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,100
Roberto and tiger.

66
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,400
Who's your brother?

67
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:05,300
In fact, you have two other brothers and all of you are in Tech as well, right?

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,900
Yeah, I guess, you know, you know what they say the Apple doesn't fall far?

69
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,100
Fall far from the tree.

70
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,400
My dad was in technology and all three of his sons are also in technology.

71
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400
So maybe there's something to that, that's pretty awesome.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,400
Wow, cool.

73
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay so then now fast-forward to where we're at today and you know you're seeing how things are trending across the economy, across the globe From, as mentioned earlier, the feds raising interest rates to hopefully decrease the inflation that's taking place.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:57,900
But I would love to hear your perspective and thoughts of what you see from Jerry's lens with how the feds increase is going to effect?

75
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,600
You know, it's affecting all the economy and even affecting what we're seeing taking place across attack.

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,800
Yeah, you know it's interesting.

77
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,100
I started my first company after the last crash the last time.

78
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:17,200
The economy crashed was in 2008 and I started a company and 2009, right?

79
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:33,500
So, you know, I don't claim to be an economics expert at all but just for my own life experience, the Federal Reserve and the greater economy has a much larger impact on companies.

80
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,500
He success than we like to thank, right?

81
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:59,800
We often sort of get this idea in our heads and it's propagated by the media where if you just have a great idea and you execute well you're going to become rich, you know, your company is going to do well but really if you look throughout history, especially in technology and technology is not really that young being at the right place at the right time and understanding how the economy works and understanding how money works.

82
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,500
You know, really has a big impact I think on this.

83
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,900
Success of companies.

84
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,500
So yeah, you mentioned the federal the FED rates raising interest rates.

85
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,200
Now, we could go in a couple of directions here, right?

86
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,500
We could talk about, you know what that even means.

87
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Let us start with that.

88
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:18,900
What?

89
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,600
Interest rates.

90
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,500
Let us start there.

91
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,400
Yeah, yeah.

92
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,800
So Now, what do we started?

93
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:40,100
I think it's one of those things where, if you think about what money is at the end of the day, You come to the conclusion that money isn't really real, right?

94
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:49,500
A lot of this things like oh it's, you know, I want to make money, there're tons of money out there if somebody has money and I don't have money like, how do I get money, but what exactly is money, right?

95
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:56,000
Like its kind of interesting question to think about and that's where the FED comes in, right?

96
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,100
The FED while they can't print money that, that road belongs to the United States Treasury.

97
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,600
They can certainly influence the amount of Money that's out there in circulation.

98
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,400
Right?

99
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:20,600
So, the, the interest rate that set by the FED is the interest rate at which the Federal Reserve Bank lends out money to other Banks and that has a huge impact on the economy.

100
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:33,100
Because economic activity is composed of two things, is composed of the total amount of money that's in the market, but it's also composed of credit and there's a lot more credit out there than there is money.

101
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,700
Probably, by an order of magnitude, right?

102
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:52,600
So I mean I don't know the exact numbers but I think there's probably less say around three trillion dollars of just like cash like US dollars out there in the market and there's probably something on the order of 50 or 60 trillion dollars worth of credit out there on the market, right?

103
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,700
So for example, let us just think about your bank account, right?

104
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,800
You what do you use for your bank account to use like, Wells, Fargo or Bank of America?

105
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,000
Thanks.

106
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:11,400
Okay, okay so let us say you put ten dollars into Chase right now?

107
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Chase can take that ten dollars, and then they can lend it out to other people.

108
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,600
And they have, what is called a reserve requirement.

109
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:28,400
Which means they only need to keep 10% of the amount on their balance sheet in cash at any one time.

110
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:36,900
So if you put ten dollars into Chase Bank, they actually have a hundred dollars that they can use to lend out to other businesses.

111
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,800
Right engine.

112
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,900
So the majority of our economy is actually composed of this credit that Banks can lend out.

113
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:51,000
And the Federal Reserve is what's considered the lender of Last Resort, which means the banks, where do they go to get money?

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,100
They actually go to the Federal Reserve.

115
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:04,500
So when the Federal Reserve sets low interest rates, that means Banks can borrow money very easily, which in turn means you as a consumer can borrow money very easily.

116
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,000
So, let us say you want to buy a house, right?

117
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:14,000
You can get a low mortgage so you can afford that dream house and Oahu that you always wanted, right?

118
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,700
And the economy booms.

119
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:24,200
But then when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, then, you know, it's more expensive for banks to get money.

120
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,600
So it's more expensive for them to lend money to you.

121
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:36,100
So then economic activity tends to grind to a halt or slow down when the FED raises interest rates, which is what's happening today in the market.

122
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,600
Gotcha.

123
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,100
Okay, so let us even rewind, a few steps back.

124
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,900
Why are the feds even raising interest rates?

125
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:54,600
And I know I have heard about yeah like there's inflation taking place it's supposed to help decrease inflation.

126
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,400
But how do we even get to this point?

127
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,400
Yeah, very good question.

128
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,000
So interest rates have been very, very low for a long time.

129
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:11,800
In fact, from 2008, all the way, till the beginning of covid, interest rates were close to zero.

130
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,900
And that's because of the previous financial crisis.

131
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,600
So, back in 2008, the entire global economy basically melted down.

132
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:28,500
And so, in order to stimulate the economy, because remember, when the FED lowers interest rates is stimulates economic activity because there's more A borrowing, there's more lending.

133
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,000
There's more credit available for businesses and individuals.

134
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,000
And so from 2008 to 2020, it was good times, right?

135
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,300
Home prices went up, stocks went up, technology went up, because people were making more money.

136
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:52,200
They wanted to invest that money and often that money went into technology companies and even riskier assets, like, like crypto which we can talk about, right?

137
00:11:53,500 --> 00:12:08,200
And so covid-19, David hit, Really, the Federal Reserve went into overdrive, and they lowered rates all the way to zero the United States Treasury printed a lot of money.

138
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:19,000
In fact, I think the statistic is around forty percent of all US dollars, that have ever existed in history were printed during 2020 and 2021.

139
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,700
Wow.

140
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,100
Right.

141
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,100
So what happens when you print a lot of money?

142
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:32,300
Well, the money that's in your wallet becomes worth less because now there're more dollars out there and that's what triggers inflation?

143
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,500
So, to answer your question, simply the FED has to raise interest rates because inflation is going crazy.

144
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,400
I think the latest official numbers are nine to ten percent, but a lot of people think, due to the way that inflation is measured.

145
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,900
It's actually a lot higher than that.

146
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,200
So, the FED really has no choice.

147
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,900
But to raise interest rates to combat inflation, got it.

148
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What's what are?

149
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,700
You know, economists saying about how long interest rates will be kept this high?

150
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,300
Nobody really knows, right?

151
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:19,300
So I have some friends on Wall Street, I have some friends that are in finance, they seem to think it will be about two years, but it's kind of like reading tea leaves right?

152
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:27,500
The Federal Reserve is not very up front about exactly what they're going to do it.

153
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,500
And often times they don't know right?

154
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:36,900
They make moves the market reacts you know there's the Federal Reserve Has two main jobs, right?

155
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,900
One is to control inflation and the other is to control unemployment.

156
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,300
So those are the two things that they look at when inflation is too high.

157
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:53,300
They have to raise rates but if rates are too high again that slows down the economy which creates unemployment, right?

158
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,100
So there are always trying to balance these two things and it's not easy.

159
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:05,500
I mean If you look at governments in the past, even, you know, before the United States, right?

160
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,400
You had the British Empire, you had the dungeon power, all these different Empires.

161
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,900
A lot of them went broke because they couldn't figure out the right balance.

162
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:13,600
Right?

163
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:28,700
Says wow, not easy to figure out and you know, I really don't know how long it's going to last but it is one of those things where covid-19 as unprecedented economic event, I mean the entire economy basically shut out.

164
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,000
Across the globe.

165
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:44,100
So, real economic activity was very low but at the same time because You know, the US Treasury was spending, so much money stocks were going through the roof, right?

166
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,800
Crypto is going through the roof.

167
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,400
Real estate was going through the roof.

168
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:58,800
So you kind of have this weird dynamic where, I mean, everybody knew the economy was down, but at the same time, all the traditional economic indicators were, right?

169
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:06,200
So yeah, it just created this, this is where weird scenario that the FED has to try to fix them.

170
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:21,000
So now understanding a little bit of the last couple of years and the macro of what's taking place with the feds interest rates, how does that affect all other parts of our Lives?

171
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,200
I mean, if you think about like we're in Tech so, you know, address that but what else are you seeing?

172
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:42,700
Across the globe across other Industries and you know you anything that you see trend-wise like how is the ripple effect of this Affecting all other parts of ultimately, you know, economy in our lives.

173
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah.

174
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,200
So it's interesting.

175
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,300
What effect is that the u.s?

176
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,000
Dollar is going crazy right now, right?

177
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:07,100
So I am here in Colombia and the Colombian peso to dollar exchange rate recently broke five thousand to one which means it's 5,000 pesos for every US dollar.

178
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,700
That's a historic Height.

179
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:15,600
Been Never, it's never been this High and the same is happening with currencies all over the world, right?

180
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:26,300
And the reason is, because as the FED raises interest rates, that means that things like treasury bills, all of a sudden become better Investments.

181
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,100
So everybody is buying us treasury bills and things like that are denominated in u.s.

182
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,800
Dollars.

183
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:41,200
So the strength of the US currency is actually shooting through the roof, which is not that great for other economies around the world, right?

184
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:53,900
Because every economy did the same thing during covid, they all printed money, But the United States because we have the world Reserve currency, which means that everybody wants to hold US dollars, right?

185
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,400
Even though we printed money, we can, I mean, we can get away with it more than other countries.

186
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:12,900
So I mean, I am here in Columbia and everybody is worried about the exchange rate, because the services has become way more expensive in Colombia, especially things that are imported from the United States because they're denominated in dollars.

187
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But everybody here is Hayden pesos right?

188
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,300
Wow.

189
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:23,700
So it's really having a drastic effect in people's livelihoods outside of the United States.

190
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:34,200
So that's one thing I have noticed this but being outside the United States currently and you talk about technology how it impacts technology is.

191
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:46,500
If you look at where all the Investments went over, the last decade and a half and especially over the last two years when you know, forty percent of the dollars were being printed.

192
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:57,700
A lot of that went to riskier Investments like technology stocks, like cryptocurrency and all of this came from all this money printing, right?

193
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:05,400
So, essentially in Tech, Money's been sort of free because the government prints, all this money, and most of that capital.

194
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,400
Ends up going into the hands of Technology startups, technology companies and cryptocurrency.

195
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,800
And now all of a sudden that's gone, right?

196
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:29,400
So it's very challenging environment for technology companies in particular because in a lot of ways, the last 15 years of tech has been a giant bubble and now that bubble is popping.

197
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,000
So describe the bubble.

198
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,800
What do you mean by that?

199
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So, remember when I said I first moved to California, because my dad got a job during the first.com.

200
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,300
Boom.

201
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,100
So that was another example of a tech bubble, right?

202
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,500
There was actually the first tech bubble that we had.

203
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,800
And so what happened was everybody was putting their money into Tech, right?

204
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,100
And then, so there was this, a lot of money sloshing around in the tech ecosystem.

205
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,900
So one example I can give you is Yahoo which was the big internet giant back in those days.

206
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
As they sold at who bought those ads.

207
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,500
Well, they were startups that were funded by Venture capitalists right?

208
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,100
Those Stars didn't really make any money but the only way to get new users was to go to Yahoo and buy ads.

209
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:27,100
So then Yahoo's business went up, but and the entire Tech ecosystem was booming, but it wasn't really based on anything real, right?

210
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,800
It was just a bunch of money being funneled into the ecosystem to drive that Innovation.

211
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,900
But ultimately these companies weren't really making that much.

212
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,200
Real money, right?

213
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:48,500
It was just this all circulating around the same ecosystem, and so I think in a similar way that's sort of happened in the last 15 years as well during their most recent Tech.

214
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Boom, and Tech bubble.

215
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,000
Although obviously there's a lot more people on the internet.

216
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,400
Now they're certainly more money to be made on the internet now.

217
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,100
But are these companies are these startups really that valuable?

218
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,600
And from what we have seen, the answer is no right.

219
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:15,900
Like Once, you turn off the spigot of free money from the Federal Reserve, you see companies lose 80% of their valuation, sometimes, 90% of their valuation, right?

220
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:22,600
And so that the markets really correcting itself right now and it's happening in the riskiest assets first, right?

221
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:29,700
So, so crypto corrected itself first and then, you know, private tech companies.

222
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,900
And now you're seeing the same thing with public tech companies, there's a big correction there that's happening to the value.

223
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,300
Ation because people were trying to figure out.

224
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,500
All right.

225
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,400
How much are these companies actually worth?

226
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,300
What's does it ever actually have any clothes, right?

227
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,900
Or is it just funny money that, that they're playing with here?

228
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:51,100
How and this might be a whole nother conversation, but how are those valuations even determined?

229
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,700
That's a really good question.

230
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,900
So there's their standard measurements, right?

231
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,000
You can take your revenue and assign it a certain multiple.

232
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,300
There's you can take profits and assign a certain multiple although revenues a little bit more.

233
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,200
Common because most tech companies are not profitable.

234
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,400
Right?

235
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,300
At least in the beginning.

236
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:20,500
So you can say, you know, say your company makes a million dollars a year and you want to sign a 10x multiples of that.

237
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,700
Then, the valuation is, is 10 million dollars.

238
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,300
Right?

239
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,500
But you also have to remember that, it's a free market.

240
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:33,200
So the ultimate answer is the valuation is whatever investors are willing to pay for it.

241
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:43,800
So if there's a lot of money available for investors to pay for Tech startups and there's a limited amount of tech startups which is always the case.

242
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,100
There's always more money looking to find a home.

243
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,500
Then there are good hopes, right?

244
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,700
Interesting.

245
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,400
So it's going to artificially inflate, the value of text are because at the end of the day, your valuation is whatever.

246
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,900
Somebody is willing to pay for it.

247
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:09,900
So, so you're saying that, there's, I want to pull that through that statement, you just made, there's more money out there to invest to land somewhere, but there's not enough maybe startups.

248
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,600
Fill tool and the money in?

249
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,800
Is that what?

250
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,500
I heard?

251
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,400
Absolutely.

252
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,000
Absolutely.

253
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,400
Absolutely.

254
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,700
For the same reasons that we talked about, right?

255
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,600
It's really easy to make money in a sense, right?

256
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:28,900
Federal Reserve can just print money out of thin air or more specifically, the US Treasury could just print money out of thin air.

257
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,100
And because the best investments are typically technology because technology is what drives human productivity forward.

258
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,300
Most of that money goes into technology but the scarce resources always innovation Right.

259
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,900
People that can truly innovate companies that can truly innovate are actually quite rare.

260
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:58,200
So what tends to happen is you have the big Winners or the people that, you know, like Facebook or Google or Tesla, right?

261
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:07,900
They receive a Lion's Share of that investment because it proven that they can edit innovate and then startups receive a big share of that investment as well, right?

262
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,500
But not every startup is It is going to succeed.

263
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:18,600
And so, what ends up happening, is the valuation of a lot of startups gets over inflated as well during those times.

264
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,000
Gotcha.

265
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:33,700
So, you know if you just look at this last year, I have heard there's been over 42,000 layoffs to date and probably more counting what's your take.

266
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:46,000
I mean, I obviously you have shared all the reasons why we have gotten to this place but Are we going to continue to see more layoffs across tech companies?

267
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,400
And is it going to stop or is this just a norm and what's going to happen with all those employees?

268
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Now who don't have jobs in Tech?

269
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,000
Is this where employees in Tech?

270
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,500
If they want to stay in Tech, need to start their own startup.

271
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:09,100
Or, you know, how do you stay in Tech and continue to survive?

272
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,500
Yeah, I mean that number honestly, sounds low 42,000.

273
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:21,400
I don't know the exact number of layoffs, often, you know, those numbers are not made public, right?

274
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,500
Certainly, if you're a large public company, you have to, you have to file those things.

275
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:33,300
But if you're a small start-up, you might not necessarily in might not even necessarily be on everybody's radar.

276
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,600
Yeah, I don't lie.

277
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,300
Don't know, I don't know.

278
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,400
If there will be more layoffs, I think it really depends on each company's individual situation.

279
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,000
And by the way, not every company is, is doing that poorly right there.

280
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:07,300
There are certainly technology companies that have very resilient business models, or for some reason, not as impacted by the economy, the current state of the economy or as impacted as other companies.

281
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:23,900
So there's certainly companies hiring I You know, we're part of the Kleiner Perkins portfolio and whenever one company in our portfolio has layoffs often those profiles are circulated to other portfolio companies that are hiring, right?

282
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,800
So I don't want to pay this picture that it's like, just doing Gloom across the board.

283
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,300
There, there are, certainly companies that are hiring.

284
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,200
There are jobs to be had.

285
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,900
Yeah, it's, it's tougher out there, right?

286
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,900
And, you know, salaries that have gone up.

287
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,600
Over the past few years really for every role.

288
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:54,700
And I think a natural thing that's going to happen is jobs might be available but I think salaries are going to have to correct as well, right?

289
00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:00,600
Because if companies are making less profit they have you know they want to get to profitability really.

290
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:16,800
The only lever you have aside from layoffs is your compensation And, so I think we will start to see correction in compensation at tech companies.

291
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,500
Honestly, it's, it's been pretty crazy.

292
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:26,600
Like how, how many salaries and compensation has gone up over the last few years, right compared to before.

293
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:32,000
And now that companies don't have the prophet and the valuation to be able to pay for the salaries.

294
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,800
I think you're going to start to see those those celery start to come down.

295
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,100
That's interesting.

296
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,900
What are your thoughts on?

297
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:47,300
So I want to pull the thread of what you mentioned earlier of like there are certain tech companies that are resilient and thriving.

298
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,700
What type of companies are those?

299
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:58,600
So that's one question and then the other question I had been for those who want to stay in Tech, maybe they were affected by a layoff.

300
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,800
What should they be doing?

301
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,800
You know, so there're two questions there, but we can answer the first ones first.

302
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,500
One is the companies that are resilient.

303
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
What do they look like?

304
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,600
Why are they able to do?

305
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:21,900
Well during a time like this, Yeah, I think there's a few interesting data points here.

306
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,500
The effects in the economy are not really spread out that evenly, right?

307
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:44,000
So for example if you look at Airbnb is actually doing quite well because even though you know overall people's paychecks might be getting Slimmer one area where people are still spending money is travel, maybe that's intuitive.

308
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,500
Maybe that's not right, but people are still spending a lot on travel.

309
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,800
So travel companies are still doing quite well.

310
00:27:48,800 --> 00:28:06,500
Like Airbnb, I think one area where Companies are really struggling as if your company is advertising dependent because one of the first things that gets cut, if a company seeking that become more profitable is advertising spend, right?

311
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:19,200
So that's why you see layoffs at maida, you see reports that you know, at Google and other companies that depend solely on Advertising as their business model, at least in the short term, right?

312
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,100
Like those companies are really going to struggle.

313
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:43,800
And you know, one other thing is, you know, SAS sped, right SAS spent at least from what we have seen has been pretty strong even in this economy and I think that's because at the end of the day, you know, SAS is just such a big part of how companies run today that it's tough to completely rip out some of these systems, right?

314
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:51,600
And so companies like Salesforce for example, or companies that have a really strong lock in for as a SAS platform.

315
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,500
Two other companies.

316
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,000
They're doing, I mean not great, right?

317
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,200
But they're, it's all relative.

318
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,400
They're doing better than some of these other companies.

319
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,300
Gotcha, an AI.

320
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,300
That's another boom.

321
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,500
That I am seeing Jasper AI, for example, their content generation company.

322
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:18,300
They just got 125 million series a like a 1.5 billion valuation or something crazy like that.

323
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,600
So we're seeing the AI technology really, boom?

324
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,900
What are your thoughts to that?

325
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:27,900
Yeah.

326
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:33,000
I mean it certainly seems to be you know the new hotness, right?

327
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:51,300
Like I think every year you sort of had this new technology or there's new promise that a lot of investors flock to and that currently seems to be AI A lot of these companies, I mean, I don't know how they're doing financially, right?

328
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:06,300
But they're receiving a lot of investment because There's been, there's been a few advancements that have been pretty revolutionary recently, and they're all around this idea of generative AI.

329
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,900
So what exactly does that mean, right?

330
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:15,900
So one example of AI is you say, for example, Google Search, right?

331
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,000
Google uses a lot of AI.

332
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So you search for something in Google, can kind of point you into the right direction or Facebook.

333
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,100
Is another example, right?

334
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,200
I mean, it's kind of creepy, but they sort of know what you look like.

335
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:34,800
And so it will suggest you images, where you're in the picture, maybe you didn't know, and you can tag yourself, things like that.

336
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,400
So, that's really where a, I was at for.

337
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:52,000
I would say the last decade was, it was just really good at finding these patterns and a lot of data and more recently, there's been advancements in what they called generative AI, which is using AI to actually produce unique things.

338
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,300
Whether it's a blog post, right?

339
00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:04,100
Or whether it's an image or You know, meta and Google recently, it has show that it's possible to use AI to even produce videos, right?

340
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:11,600
And if you look at, if you actually play around with these tools, you will realize, I mean it's got a lot of bugs, right?

341
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:29,100
It doesn't often produce exactly what you want, but the rate of innovation is increasing in these areas and venture capitalist want to pour money into an area, where a lot of smart people are working on it, and the rate of innovation is high.

342
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,000
Nobody knows if there's actually a good business case for a lot of these Technologies.

343
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,800
But right now it's, you know, sort of the, the hot, the hot technology at the moment.

344
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,200
So interesting.

345
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:52,000
Okay, I wanted to go back and answer the question that I had earlier which is around those affected by the tech layoffs right now.

346
00:31:52,400 --> 00:32:00,100
And, you know, for those that want to remain in Tech, how do they need to innovate?

347
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:10,800
Like, do they need to be learning more about Ai and, you know, studying some of the trends of the most Innovative Tech that's out there and jump.

348
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,500
On board with those type of companies, or what do you advise, for those who have been affected?

349
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,100
By layoff.

350
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:28,500
Yeah, so I mean that's a tough question to answer because I think it depends on the individual, right?

351
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:36,700
What they're interested in what their skill set is how they want to apply that to the technology space.

352
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,800
For me, when I thought about at least when I was an employee, right?

353
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:51,200
One of the things I thought about was how do I, how do I put myself in a position to succeed in the long term?

354
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,500
Right.

355
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:04,100
And so, when the iPhone first came out, for example, I knew that technology wave like, I didn't know how big mobile would be.

356
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:17,000
But I was like, you know what if I put my bet in this mobile wave, I want to learn everything that I can about it because I just see a lot more growth opportunities there than I do in defense for example, right?

357
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:26,200
Like but defense, is it just wasn't innovating at the same rate and so, I think you know, layoffs are always tough right?

358
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:44,600
But I think sort of aligning yourself and hitching Your Wagon to technologies that you feel like have a lot of promise that a lot of investors are putting Capital into I think is always a good idea.

359
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:52,000
Again nobody knows how long this recession will be but there's still companies hiring right there are still companies hiring.

360
00:33:52,600 --> 00:34:01,000
Even during this time, it's again, it's sort of uneven wear which companies are most impacted.

361
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,500
So what are as an entrepreneur as a Founder?

362
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:21,000
What are the qualities that you think employees people need to have in a bear market like now you know in order to be resilient and to be successful?

363
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,699
That's best.

364
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,500
However, they Define.

365
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:29,199
That I know there's some just mindset attributes that can help folks.

366
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:46,100
As they are waking up every morning and whether it's working on their resume and getting things out, or tackling a product that they're trying to drive pipeline for, you know, Across the board.

367
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:52,199
People are feeling the recession and the effects of the uncertainty it creates.

368
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:56,000
So what do you advise for how we show up?

369
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,700
What's the mindset we carry?

370
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,200
What do you do?

371
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Yeah, I mean stay resilient.

372
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,000
This is one of those things where if you think about the economy, right?

373
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,500
It's very psychological.

374
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,000
When people's, I am sure you have noticed this, right?

375
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,600
Like when everybody thinks the economy is doing bad, the economy is of doing that.

376
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,300
Because at the other day, the economy's is composed of people, right?

377
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:29,200
And yes, of course, the Federal Reserve and all these macroeconomic factors played a part in to it.

378
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,400
But I think our Collective psychology, also plays a big part in to it as well.

379
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,500
That's why certain companies do better than others, right?

380
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,300
Because their Collective psychology is, is more positive.

381
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:46,000
They're like, well, yeah, you know, I am just going to control what I can control these other macroeconomic factors.

382
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:58,600
I can't really control, but I mean, it sounds sort of tried to say, but keeping a positive mindset actually does help because then you start to think about ways, we're okay.

383
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,800
Well, you know I can't really Troll these things.

384
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,200
So I am not going to worry about those.

385
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,100
But this is one thing I can't control, right?

386
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:12,300
So for me right now, one of the things that I can't control is our own product and our own company, right?

387
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,800
Like how do we innovate in this time?

388
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:21,100
What are some opportunities that are emerging now that didn't really emerge before, right?

389
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,700
Like you look at a lot of our competitors, and they're struggling to write.

390
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,300
So in a way it's harder to catch competitors.

391
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:40,200
When the economy's doing good, Because they receive more funding and more funding leads to be able to hire more people and there's this positive Loop but when the economy isn't doing so great, right?

392
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:48,000
The if you're a larger, you actually have more of a disadvantage, because it's harder for you to Pivot, that's hardest for you to adapt.

393
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,000
And I think the same is sort of true of individuals, as well, right?

394
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,900
Like you have 100% control over what you can control and being able.

395
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:15,200
Able to Pivot and adapt quicker is always going to be an advantage versus, you know, feeling helpless, which we all I think tend to feel helpless during these times.

396
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:29,500
But I do think the ones that can keep a more positive mindset and think about what they can control, both companies and individuals are going to end up being more successful and coming out the other side of the recession in a better spot.

397
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,100
That's great.

398
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,300
Love that.

399
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,500
All right, I am going to ask a completely different question.

400
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,100
We're going to move into cryptocurrency, you're touching it a little bit.

401
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:49,400
Walk me through just a little bit of your experience in crypto and, you know, as an investor.

402
00:37:49,400 --> 00:38:01,000
Like all those things yourself like, give us a little bit of a history lesson of crypto and how we have gotten to where we're at today and like help.

403
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,200
Help Define that landscape if you will?

404
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,700
Yeah, so I am not super involved in crypto.

405
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:15,600
I played around with Bitcoin and a few others, but I am not the most knowledgeable person about crypto.

406
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,600
There's certainly other people at welcome that have a lot more knowledge and experience than I do.

407
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:29,700
But the way I look at crypto is its the first real fundamental innovation in money itself, right?

408
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:42,000
So if you think about what money actually is throughout human history since the invention of money, Any money has required basically like a centralized authority to say.

409
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:49,000
This piece of gold is valuable or you know, this dollar bill is valuable, right?

410
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,000
If you think about it, if I give you a dollar like how do you know that dollars any good?

411
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,600
It's because the government of the United States says it's valuable, right?

412
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:13,000
So throughout human history, it's been government's typically that have had control over money and crypto starting with Bitcoin and the fundamental Innovation by Satoshi Nakamoto that the you know, pseudonymous Creator Vic.

413
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:20,600
Coin was that now we can use math and I won't go into the specifics about that math.

414
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:28,200
But essentially we can use math and place of governments to create a currency that people can use and Trust, right?

415
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:37,600
So this is, I mean, to me, I think this is probably one of the most breakthrough ideas and breakthrough, Innovations in all of human history.

416
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,500
I think, I think it's bigger than the internet.

417
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,800
I think bigger than computers.

418
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,500
I think it's bigger than cars.

419
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,900
It could fundamentally change human civilization.

420
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
So that's why a lot of people are excited about it.

421
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,600
That's why there's been so much investment into it.

422
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,700
It's been, I think it's been about 14 or 15 years.

423
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,200
I can't remember the date.

424
00:39:59,200 --> 00:39:59,600
Exactly.

425
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:10,400
But it's been about 14 or 15 years since the invention of Bitcoin since then, there's been applications of the same decentralized technology into other areas, right?

426
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,400
So instead of just Money.

427
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:23,500
That's that centralized people are working on ways to decentralize the entire Financial system decentralize laws decentralize.

428
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:33,000
You know, a lot of people make fun of MIT and if T is right, but even decentralize art and collectibles and things like that.

429
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,500
So there's a lot of really smart people working in crypto, but it's also a very risky investment asset.

430
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,700
So just as it went up.

431
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,300
Really sharply during the last couple of years.

432
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,700
It's plummeted quite a bit now, as well.

433
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,200
Hmm.

434
00:40:52,900 --> 00:41:05,600
And you know you were talking about earlier just something very interesting that's happened, even today about the purchasing of the ft x.

435
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:19,000
And you mentioned, you know, even today in history there's some pretty unique things taking place in crypto Yeah, I mean cryptos kind of like the Wild West, right?

436
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,100
Like if you remember, all the western movies, The Wild West is an untamed place.

437
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:34,900
It's a place of, there's a lot of lawlessness, there's a lot of scams, there's a lot of shady characters, and I would characterize a Cristo space, the same way, right?

438
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,000
It's a, it's not for the faint of heart.

439
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:44,000
I will say that I live in Puerto Rico and there's a lot of crypto folks in Puerto Rico, some people are generally trying to advance Humanity.

440
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:55,400
Some people are trying to You off and the governments around the world, have really been slow to react in terms of like, how do we regulate this thing, right?

441
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:01,400
How do we regulate something that's fundamentally decentralised and is designed to take government out of the equation.

442
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,800
Very difficult problem to solve, right?

443
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And, so I think the, the same reason why a lot of people are attracted to crypto, is also what makes it makes Dangerous.

444
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,500
And also what makes, you know, what makes it risky for a lot of people as well.

445
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,700
So, the event that you mentioned today.

446
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I mean, I have to jump in about a minute, so I can't get into a whole lot of details, but essentially, the number one, crypto, Exchange Finance.

447
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:55,200
Excuse me, in the period of about bless you in the period of about two or three days, triggered a series of events which led to Their number two, competitor, FTX essentially needing a bailout and a now, they're working out a deal.

448
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,900
Where the basically, the number one, crypto exchange is buying the number to crypto exchange.

449
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:08,200
And people are still trying to sort out what happened but there's not a lot of regulation in the space, right?

450
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:14,900
It's sort of shoot first, ask questions later type of environment and it's pretty crazy.

451
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:32,700
It's straight out of a Hollywood movie I think and maybe in a later episode we can get into the details but it really highlights, you know what makes crypto so interesting but also makes it an extremely risky proposition as well.

452
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,400
So fascinating, the Wild West indeed.

453
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,300
All right, Jerry will thank you so much for your time.

454
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,500
