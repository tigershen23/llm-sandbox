Obviously, we are not the same people from 2020 to this collective experience.

We have all had over the past few years has left truly a lasting imprint and it's completely redefining the role of work and balance and wellness in our lives today.

14
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:47,015
You know, according to ladders 25% of All professional jobs in North America, will be remote by the end of 2020 to and remote opportunities will continue to increase through 2023.

15
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:54,515
So today I am really excited about what we're going to talk about with our CEOs, as they're leading distribute.

16
00:21:54,515 --> 00:22:05,215
Team teams, we want to hear what they're seeing, what are the trends, the predictions they're picking up right now and into the next 12 months and 24 months.

Thank you for pulling that poll.

24
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:32,015
Which one of these do you think will be a top Trend in 2023, remote only work hybrid work in person?

25
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:38,915
Work mental health and well-being, access to Talent OR flying First which of these feel free to place your votes.

26
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:44,915
All right, we see mental health and well-being and hybrid work.

27
00:22:44,915 --> 00:22:45,715
Being top.

28
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:47,415
Top up there, okay?

29
00:22:47,515 --> 00:22:47,915

32
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,615
CEO of welcome.

33
00:23:07,515 --> 00:23:08,715
Hi.

34
00:23:10,615 --> 00:23:17,315
Hey Dina it's going well, thank you for opening up and hosting the conversation looking forward to.

35
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:19,915
Absolutely, we are very excited about this.

36
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:20,515
Could eat.

37
00:23:20,715 --> 00:23:26,515
You introduce yourselves and maybe tell us a little bit about what you're building for our who distributed teams.

38
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:29,615
And I will start with you rob Roberto.

39
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:31,615
Got Two Brothers Rubber.

40
00:23:33,115 --> 00:23:37,015
And to be clear, we just coordinate this in the green room because we got to Rob's up here.

41
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,715
And I am doing by Roberto today buddy.

42
00:23:39,715 --> 00:23:40,715
Like Roberto CEO.

43
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:42,115
Co-founder of welcome.

44
00:23:42,415 --> 00:24:03,215
We, we built the technology that's being used for this event are Technologies, helps companies that are driving Table and remote employee experiences, and they're asking the question how to engage their employees and better ways how to communicate and better ways than the technology that we were used to prior to this.

45
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:04,915
And so welcome, fits that Gap.

46
00:24:04,915 --> 00:24:16,115
So we Empower connection of this remote Workforce, and we're happy, we're happy to just be serving sort of the shift and this future of work that we all find ourselves.

47
00:24:20,615 --> 00:24:25,215
Dr. Rob and thanks again for saving the name.

48
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:39,315
Rob's me for this conversation is much appreciated, so I am Rob I am the CEO and co-founder at scoop, we're big fans of hybrid work, you know, and believe pretty great deeply in the future is being hybrid and some capacity.

49
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:50,615
And one of the things that we started to find very early in the pandemic though, was that if hybrid work is fundamentally about choice and there are good reasons why you might want to.

50
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:53,315
To work from home or work in the office on a given day.

51
00:24:53,715 --> 00:25:01,515
Nothing really is worse than if you decide to go into the office, you find no one else has their, you spend the day on video conference and you say, well, this is kind of waste of time.

52
00:25:01,515 --> 00:25:02,315
Why do we do this?

53
00:25:02,315 --> 00:25:07,515
And so we built software that's built into slack and Google Calendar and chrome.

54
00:25:07,815 --> 00:25:20,315
That allows you to see flexibly who's working, where who's planning on working, where updated status and calendar, it will pass slack updating slack, it will pass to other platforms, make it the hybrid work is a little bit easier to operate.

55
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:28,315
You can actually unlock that flexibility and when you go to the office, always feels worth it, so appreciate being invited and excited to do this.

56
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:31,115
Thanks, Rob.

57
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:33,215
Jason, awesome.

58
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:34,815
My name is Jason Lindstrom.

59
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:36,315
Lovely to meet everybody.

60
00:25:36,315 --> 00:26:09,315
Virtually, I am the CEO of over at Buck of the street wards where we are a rewards and recognition platform and like fundamentally when you take great care of your staff, they perform better, and they stick around longer and Pockets rewards is all about, you know, recognizing both the micro moments and the big achievements of your staff which helps reduce turnover by as much as 80% in precreasing Coke, Employee Engagement by 25%, and I am just personally am very deeply interested in building, high-performing cultures.

61
00:26:09,315 --> 00:26:12,315
And we're on a mission to help build the best cultures in the world.

62
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:22,015
And so today's topic is super relevant, I am happy to share any sort of tips tricks or insights into the future because like we're Berto and Rob.

63
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:29,715
I am sure I have had a chance to work with hundreds of clients and see how people are doing things today, and how some people are doing things in a very Progressive Way for the Future.

64
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:32,215
So looking forward to sharing any insights.

65
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,415
I might have Thanked you all.

66
00:26:35,715 --> 00:26:47,015
We're very excited to hear you those tips and tricks, for sure, we have got five different categories that we wanted to cover and, you know, we will see what we can get through.

67
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:53,715
Because I am seeing the questions begin to pop up in the Q&A panel, but one is flexibility and quality of life.

68
00:26:53,715 --> 00:26:57,415
The second is employee management communication Wellness.

69
00:26:58,115 --> 00:27:02,615
Going fully remote versus in person hybrid and creating a better workplace.

70
00:27:03,015 --> 00:27:05,415
And I know each of you have touched that.

71
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:11,415
So the first trend is around flexibility and quality of life.

72
00:27:11,815 --> 00:27:14,615
Now, we see these stats, here's one stat from future.

73
00:27:14,615 --> 00:27:33,315
Forums pulse, survey reports that knowledge workers who say they have little to no ability to set their own hours, are 2.6 more likely to definitely look for a new job 2.2%, you know, times worse, it works in.

74
00:27:33,515 --> 00:27:40,115
Related Stress and Anxiety and 1.7 times worse in work-life Balance, 1.4 times the worst pronounce.

75
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:41,215
We're seeing that.

76
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:46,015
A lot of knowledge workers are wanting flexibility.

77
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:52,115
What are you seeing as the pros and cons around flexible work?

78
00:27:54,315 --> 00:27:56,315
I will kick off on my side.

79
00:27:56,915 --> 00:28:00,315
Is that Rob, I have robbed all pass it over to the.

80
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:04,715
I have passed it over to you, but just taking a step back.

81
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:19,915
I think that, you know, we're here we're talking about sort of the trends were talking about the future, but I think it's pretty clear to say that what we have all experienced is just shift in remote and flex.

82
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:23,515
Becoming a first class citizen in how we work.

83
00:28:24,115 --> 00:28:30,315
I no longer our leaders and employees thinking about it the same way they were thinking about it 23 years ago.

84
00:28:30,615 --> 00:28:41,315
And so it's pretty safe to say that, you know, a new way of working is becoming a permanent fixture in the boardrooms and meetings and how we actually look at work.

85
00:28:41,815 --> 00:28:46,615
And I think that also something to take into consideration that I won't think is discussed.

86
00:28:46,615 --> 00:29:09,915
As is often like how folks are prioritizing work given the 23 years that we have gone through, folks, understanding, and getting a taste of flexibility, what has that done to the way, they look at work, the way that they look at Travel, the way that they look at what was to, what could be.

87
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:23,615
I think, is a really, really interesting sort of like foundational piece to the conversation here because you know, I think that there's a lot of pros and cons and anything you look at, you can always make a pros and cons list.

88
00:29:24,015 --> 00:29:29,315
On anything, you can, we can make a pros and cons list, making a family trip to Disney World.

89
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:36,315
There's always going to be a pros and cons list but I think at a very high level Gina and Rob I will hand it over to you.

90
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:46,415
I think that you know there's a lot of Pros that comes with this more flexible way of looking at work both to employee choice.

91
00:29:46,415 --> 00:30:07,115
Not just from the employee side choosing where to live but also the employer choosing to employ people from I am around the world and looking at a diverse set of talent from around the world and saying, yes, we can equip you now and bring you into this organization because we have been forced to change the way we work.

92
00:30:07,115 --> 00:30:09,915
We have been forced to restructure the way we meet.

93
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:22,815
We have been forced to rethink the way that we operate from the ground up because the best companies are doing that work and have already done that work to change the way they work, so they can support this new future.

94
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:25,615
And so A lot of Pros that comes on that side.

95
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:44,115
I think the cons comes and now and I say cons lightly because I think that cons is really the level of intention necessary to operate a successful organization today versus two years ago and it can be looked as a con because it looks like more work.

96
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:52,315
But this is the fast track way to be a more future-oriented Workforce and Company is to do the intentional work.

97
00:30:52,315 --> 00:31:07,615
Now to figure out how to drive an equitable experience for people that are in the office versus not to do the work on, making sure that you have the right technology in place to know when to go to the office, we're obviously to the technology that you're building.

98
00:31:07,815 --> 00:31:08,015
All right.

99
00:31:08,015 --> 00:31:16,615
It's doing the intentional work to have the time to meet to figure out the policies to look at the tools to invest in whether that's training or technology.

100
00:31:17,115 --> 00:31:22,115
So it feels like calm because there's a lot more work to it because people are resistant to change.

101
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:26,015
But the beauty about is if we lean into We're all in a better place, right?

102
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:29,415
Our employees are in a better place, our organization and the bottom line.

103
00:31:29,715 --> 00:31:33,415
And so that's how I think about the pros and cons my side.

104
00:31:37,015 --> 00:32:01,815
I will add a couple of thoughts and I agree, I think a lot of the framing around the intentionality resonates with me personally and maybe in terms of framing some of the benefits and then I will get into some of the cons, but I will kind of split the way I think about this, at least into two pieces, maybe one that's more macro and one that's kind of like more micro to the individual, you know, and in a macro context and it's pretty wild.

105
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:03,615
They want two things that fascinates me about it.

106
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:16,215
The concept of flexible work and hybrid remote work is Yeah, by end of this year, something like a billion people globally are going to be working in some kind of hybrid or flexible remote type of capacity.

107
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:21,615
It is arguably the biggest change that our generation will experience, right?

108
00:32:21,615 --> 00:32:24,515
Then it comes to like the concept of work and what it means to work.

109
00:32:24,515 --> 00:32:36,415
And one of the huge benefits I see in that is ability to enable talent and local markets to have access to more jobs and as a result, build local economies, right?

110
00:32:36,615 --> 00:32:39,615
Like for a lot of us work in tech, for example.

111
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:45,115
And one of the things that used to be true in Tech is that certain metros our cities kind of hoovered up Tech Talent, right?

112
00:32:45,115 --> 00:32:49,715
If you wanted to go work in technical would hike out to the Bay Area or two other locations.

113
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:58,515
And the idea that folks can be much more distributed now work in different locations, have local offices that they could go into and still join companies.

114
00:32:58,515 --> 00:33:02,715
That may be headquartered halfway across the world as extremely powerful, right?

115
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:04,315
And it keeps local talent local.

116
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,515
It has a lot of impact on local economies in the world.

117
00:33:06,615 --> 00:33:08,415
Those ecosystems get built over time.

118
00:33:08,615 --> 00:33:13,215
So in a macro sense I think that's incredibly valuable on a more micro level.

119
00:33:13,215 --> 00:33:22,015
It kind of the individual level there's a lot of things that I think we learned or beneficial about flexibility over the experience the last few years, right?

120
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:31,715
And whether that's days that you want to work from home because of a personal commitment or an errand or something else going on, I personally attitude.

121
00:33:31,715 --> 00:33:36,515
Maybe that just a little insight to my life solve this really viscerally firsthand.

122
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:40,515
Because I have a daughter who will be one on actually tomorrow.

123
00:33:41,115 --> 00:33:51,515
And so she was born during the pandemic and I saw the experience for my wife, you know, working and having that flexibility to work from home and how impactful that was for her when daughter was really, really young.

124
00:33:51,515 --> 00:34:00,915
And so they're real benefits that come with being able to have that flexibility and work from home at the same time, like there's connection that comes from being around others.

125
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:11,215
And there are certain activities, you know whether it be grabbing lunch or grabbing coffee or brainstorming something, Snow White boarding where there will always be some value being able to get folks together.

126
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:17,315
And the idea that you have the flexibility to potentially pick and choose, you know, on what day is certain things work best for you.

127
00:34:17,415 --> 00:34:18,915
I think is incredibly powerful.

128
00:34:18,915 --> 00:34:39,415
It's one of the Silver, Linings of the pandemic, experience, on the flip side, you know, from a Content perspective, I think what Roberto said is pretty accurate, you know where it requires an increased level of intentionality, you know, in terms of, where do I spend my time and being thoughtful about that in advance, whereAs you know, before, maybe most folks have the default.

129
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:46,614
Okay, well, I know I am going to be in the office and so you get the car or get the subway, I go back and forth now, it's okay.

130
00:34:46,614 --> 00:34:49,014
Well, is it a good decision to go into the office?

131
00:34:49,014 --> 00:34:51,715
Who else is going to be in the office about that's type of software?

132
00:34:51,715 --> 00:35:06,415
Obviously, it's scoop that we build is to try and reduce that decision pain, make it as easy as possible, so you can unlock those benefits, but I do think that there's an increase in intentionality and one of the things we will talk about a little bit as an increased need to be thoughtful around boundaries and how do you enable people?

133
00:35:06,615 --> 00:35:12,515
Be able to set their own schedule and be thoughtful around that in the right way so that you can work flexibly but not have a takeover.

134
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:14,515
Hmm.

135
00:35:15,815 --> 00:35:37,415
That's awesome context, Rob I like how you framed it most in the micro and the macro I might share my brief take on this as well and I will start just from the first person and then maybe expand, but I love that, you talked about being able to be there for your daughter's birthday, in my experience, in this whole remote work experience by working from home.

136
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:38,615
I am exercising, more.

137
00:35:38,615 --> 00:35:40,115
I am back to my university.

138
00:35:40,115 --> 00:35:43,415
Wait again, I am spending way more time with my family.

139
00:35:44,415 --> 00:35:50,315
I have got a We're all going to six year old and I think the quality time relationship I am building with them is fantastic.

140
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:57,115
So personally I deeply passionate about remote work but then going more to the macro and framing the big picture.

141
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:57,715
That's it.

142
00:35:57,715 --> 00:36:11,115
I think there's like really important context, for example, some Industries like healthcare Hospitality going to remotes can be far more challenging and the barriers of the pros and cons list might be a little bit different from say Tech space.

143
00:36:12,515 --> 00:36:18,815
But even looking at organizations that are naturally conducive to going to remote hybrid type of environment.

144
00:36:19,215 --> 00:36:24,515
I think there's some real important fundamentals that almost hit below the remote conversation.

145
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:32,015
For example, I read recently that seven percent of people do feel a sense of meaning and purpose from work.

146
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:40,715
Meaning they're looking to their job to help deal meaning in their life, so they can see more important than ever for companies to have really meaningful Mission Vision and values.

147
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:45,215
And then once you have a great Mission Vision and value, I also think it's deep.

148
00:36:45,415 --> 00:36:47,515
You can call to get people in their zones, genius.

149
00:36:47,515 --> 00:37:03,015
These are the things that we love to do, and they're also really, really good at and I think if you anchor from there, the remote conversation becomes a lot more easy because you're getting people to do the things that I love to do in a meaningful organization that has a big impact in the world and than Super tactically.

150
00:37:03,215 --> 00:37:08,015
Any time, I attend a session like this, I am always looking for cool ideas on how to build a really great experience.

151
00:37:08,015 --> 00:37:15,115
Remote experience we say quality of life experience in some kind of fun thing that we do internally that I think there's a lot of meaning.

152
00:37:15,315 --> 00:37:16,115
For employees.

153
00:37:16,115 --> 00:37:20,415
As we have, we have this program that helps employees achieve life goals.

154
00:37:20,415 --> 00:37:25,515
So basically, everybody gets some money and a day off to knock something off, their, their life, to do list.

155
00:37:25,715 --> 00:37:35,415
We happen to get $500 and one day off per year, and I have seen people do everything from taking flight lessons to go into an NFL football game with their son.

156
00:37:36,015 --> 00:37:37,415
There's one girl named Julie.

157
00:37:37,415 --> 00:37:40,015
She never taken her husband to go whale watching.

158
00:37:40,715 --> 00:37:44,615
I asked her how it went afterwards, and she said it was one of the most meaningful experiences in our life.

159
00:37:44,615 --> 00:37:51,215
So I think moving in Mission Vision and values getting people into the zones of genius and helping them achieve whatever matters.

160
00:37:51,215 --> 00:37:59,015
Most in life are great Baseline to build a whole remote conversation offer Wow, that's powerful.

161
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:11,215
I think as a mom of three I totally relate to you and parenting and the joys that remote flexibility offers in getting that closeness and each of you our fathers.

162
00:38:12,115 --> 00:38:15,415
And so, that's, that's pretty awesome to hear.

163
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:17,415
Thank you for answering that.

164
00:38:17,415 --> 00:38:26,115
Now, we have got a question Q&A that actually relates to this Katie, if you don't mind pulling that on stage, how are you managing flexibility?

165
00:38:26,115 --> 00:38:27,115
For your company?

166
00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:34,015
Unseen both productivity and wellness so employees don't experience burnout.

167
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:41,515
It's kind of goes to boundaries, I think rob you mentioned that.

168
00:38:43,715 --> 00:38:45,315
Yeah, I am happy to I will kick off.

169
00:38:45,315 --> 00:38:47,415
I will just share, just we can cover more ground.

170
00:38:47,415 --> 00:38:49,615
I will just cover one example of something that we're doing that.

171
00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:51,415
We found impactful and then pass them along.

172
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:58,315
But one of the things that we learned over the last couple of years and you know, Roberto and incur.

173
00:38:58,315 --> 00:39:07,815
I am curious if everybody else has ever experienced this Jason you to like, is when we would do time off and everybody kind of plan their own time off?

174
00:39:07,815 --> 00:39:13,315
Sometimes when you're on PTO, it's a little bit challenging because the rest of the business is continuing to move.

175
00:39:13,515 --> 00:39:13,915
Long.

176
00:39:13,915 --> 00:39:28,915
And so you go on PTO and either you feel like you got do a bunch of work to kind of prep for it on the front end or you come back and you get this Avalanche of stuff that you missed, and it kind of creates a little bit of stress or fraying on the ends that make that dto slightly less valuable in some ways.

177
00:39:28,915 --> 00:39:34,015
And so, one thing that we start doing it just for company-wide time off, any consistent basis.

178
00:39:34,015 --> 00:39:43,115
And so a couple examples we did in that is like we did hold the whole week in July 4th off for the company, we do whole week between Christmas and New Year's off.

179
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:46,815
Have picked a few other kind of like long weekends, over the course of the year.

180
00:39:46,815 --> 00:40:03,715
And basically tried to have the entire company be off at similar times and found that like, when everybody's work stops, it means the likelihood of you getting pinged with something else while you're out and not being able to protect that time goes down and the relative pick up on the other side of it, you know, isn't quite as bad.

181
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:06,715
People obviously still do, I am going to PTO.

182
00:40:06,715 --> 00:40:18,015
So folks take their own vacation, obviously, at times if they want you outside of it, but at least having those couple moments of course, and they I have found to be, you know, pretty good refresher for folks in terms of trying to find some balance.

183
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:20,115
Yeah no doubt.

184
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:22,715
So Rob I will piggyback off of that.

185
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:24,915
We also do very similar, right?

186
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:27,515
We just did the week of summer break.

187
00:40:27,515 --> 00:40:28,215
We called it.

188
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:28,515
Alright?

189
00:40:28,515 --> 00:40:29,115
In July.

190
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:38,215
So we can just kind of check out super helpful to make sure that everybody's off and there's not like the feeling of being left behind or trying to catch up on emails.

191
00:40:38,715 --> 00:40:45,915
One thing we also introduced is Wellness Fridays and with that means it's it really becomes just a wellness weekend.

192
00:40:46,415 --> 00:40:51,015
A weekend, Focus On Wellness happens once Of the first Friday of every month.

193
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:54,315
We tell people, to log off and just go, B.

194
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:55,915
Go B, go do whatever it is.

195
00:40:55,915 --> 00:40:56,315
You want to do.

196
00:40:56,315 --> 00:40:57,315
You want to sleep in that day?

197
00:40:57,315 --> 00:40:59,715
You want to go on a quick weekend trip.

198
00:40:59,715 --> 00:41:07,515
Please go do that, and we kick that off this year, and it's been I think game-changing, not just for employees, before leaders, as well.

199
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:13,015
For Founders, for us, is actually unplugged and lead, by example, and say, you know what?

200
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:15,415
Like, I am actually going to go ahead and unplug.

201
00:41:15,415 --> 00:41:19,015
I am a Google, go do this, and this is something that I am personally working on.

202
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:21,115
Jason, I love to hear your back to your college.

203
00:41:21,115 --> 00:41:22,415
Wait that's inspiration.

204
00:41:22,415 --> 00:41:23,315
I got to get back out there.

205
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:24,315
Go for a run as well.

206
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,315
But what are the things for me personally has been?

207
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:32,615
How do I make sure that if I want my employees to be well, how does it start with me?

208
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,915
How do I be well?

209
00:41:34,015 --> 00:41:45,615
So, when I show up into a call so that when I show up on a 10-1, I am not carrying the weight of all the things of lack of boundaries and so, all my calendar.

210
00:41:45,615 --> 00:41:48,915
I legit have family time blocked off my entire team.

211
00:41:49,215 --> 00:42:04,315
Is this and I marked it in the golden color on my calendar because like, those golden hours is like, regardless of what time zone, you're on, like this is my time when I am going to be reading to my kid or having dinner with my family, that's like a no-go signal.

212
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:08,015
And I think there's such a mean going back to intention.

213
00:42:08,315 --> 00:42:09,915
It's not just the employer intention.

214
00:42:09,915 --> 00:42:28,115
This is why it's difficult, it's not just the employer in such an also the employee intention because as an employer you're saying, look, I want to hire people, that work around the world and I expect that you also can put the right boundaries around your work, and I want to empower you to do so.

215
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:37,515
And so it's a two-way thing where it's like, you control your calendar, you can jump off of a meeting if there's a meeting scheduled, that's not an alignment.

216
00:42:37,915 --> 00:42:44,515
If the culture set up properly and properly accepting of remote and probably accepting of flexibility.

217
00:42:45,115 --> 00:42:50,515
Then the magic there is empowering every individual to take Control of their time.

218
00:42:50,815 --> 00:42:54,115
If you want to go for that run, then go for that run.

219
00:42:54,415 --> 00:43:05,415
If it's important for you to pick up your daughter at 3:00, you know, East Coast time, every single day, you can do that because the school is 10 minutes away before you had to work an hour away.

220
00:43:05,615 --> 00:43:11,715
But now you have the ability to jump into car or go for a walk, pick up your kid, come back, that's the beauty of remote.

221
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:15,715
And if we don't allow that to happen, then why are we working remotely?

222
00:43:15,715 --> 00:43:16,915
Why are we even flexible?

223
00:43:17,015 --> 00:43:18,015
If we're not going to do that.

224
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:26,415
So I think this really Important thing around, intentionality coming from the employer but also from the employee to feel empowered to take control of their time.

225
00:43:29,915 --> 00:43:31,415
Yeah, I get awesome.

226
00:43:31,415 --> 00:43:51,215
I think I am just gonna provide a short summary because we do some similar takes as to some of the items you mentioned Roberto and Rob it where we first started really struggling with work-life balance, is an organization, is when you became a truly distributed company, where we started having employees in different countries around the world.

227
00:43:51,215 --> 00:44:20,015
And we're trying to manage multiple time zones, and so we built a full like Playbook policy on distributed work and one of the best Takeaways, I think because we have just a four-hour overlap, where we expect everybody to be available and freely like kind of on when it comes to like slack or instant messaging email excetera then outside of those hours, people can set their own boundaries in terms of like, you know, family time in terms of like health and wellness and then in terms of the health and wellness, peace, we don't do it, do it once per month.

228
00:44:20,015 --> 00:44:21,215
So that's a really cool idea.

229
00:44:21,215 --> 00:44:29,215
The Friday off every month, we have a health and wellness day once per quarter for all staff and that's similar to your take Right?

230
00:44:29,215 --> 00:44:32,515
So we have had some awesome feedback, people love it and it's we don't question.

231
00:44:32,515 --> 00:44:33,915
It doesn't require approval.

232
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:38,615
It's more of a notification than taking a certain day off to ya to take care of my health and wellness.

233
00:44:39,815 --> 00:44:47,515
And then, lastly, I think one of the best ways for managing distributed teams or remote teams, is getting more focused on outcomes.

234
00:44:47,515 --> 00:44:48,315
Not inputs.

235
00:44:48,615 --> 00:44:56,315
So rather than grinding out a really, really heavy day setting some really clear like kpis or success metrics for each staff member.

236
00:44:57,315 --> 00:45:05,615
And for example, we have these things called Scorecards that we used to create like job descriptions that we use in our weekly, 12 ones and performance reviews as well.

237
00:45:05,915 --> 00:45:11,015
But it's typically three to five outcomes, we expect from every single role to create alignment across the organization.

238
00:45:11,815 --> 00:45:17,015
And that's created a lot of clarity because the sales is always the easiest one because it's so metric driven.

239
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:23,115
But like, if you're crushing your sales Target, I don't really, and you're a good culture fit and a good human being.

240
00:45:23,815 --> 00:45:27,615
I don't, you know, I don't really care whether you work in 12 hours or six hours.

241
00:45:27,615 --> 00:45:28,915
It's about like hitting those out.

242
00:45:29,015 --> 00:45:29,515
It comes.

243
00:45:29,515 --> 00:45:35,615
So that's kind of been our take on managing distributed work and the work-life balance.

244
00:45:37,915 --> 00:45:38,215
Thank you.

245
00:45:38,215 --> 00:45:46,615
That Jason that's actually a perfect layup into our next trending category of employee management and communication for distributed teams.

246
00:45:47,015 --> 00:45:55,415
So you know as we're all talking about here managing distributed teams, it's evolving the way we communicate.

247
00:45:55,415 --> 00:45:56,515
The way we lead.

248
00:45:57,715 --> 00:45:58,815
What are the challenges?

249
00:45:58,815 --> 00:46:01,015
You're Currently encountering with that.

250
00:46:01,515 --> 00:46:03,715
How do you see into the future?

251
00:46:04,015 --> 00:46:16,215
This will evolve there was a quote from Stewart Butterfield slack where he was saying, we're barely skimming the surface of understanding the tools needed to effectively manage remote.

252
00:46:16,415 --> 00:46:22,615
So what are the challenges that you're encountering, where things are seeing today and what do you see into the future?

253
00:46:30,015 --> 00:46:32,715
Anybody going to jump into that one?

254
00:46:34,115 --> 00:46:35,115
I will kick it off.

255
00:46:35,115 --> 00:46:43,815
I will kick it off on my side, so I think you know Stuart from slack he's completely right on when you know when he talks about this all the time.

256
00:46:44,315 --> 00:46:45,515
All of us use slack.

257
00:46:45,515 --> 00:46:59,315
We feel like slack is the thing that connects us remotely in many, many ways and even yet you know, the person leading that's a technology in that company says we were just scratching the surface on the Technologies needed to do this really well.

258
00:46:59,815 --> 00:47:00,515
And I think that's true.

259
00:47:00,515 --> 00:47:15,515
I think that we have taking the tools that have existed already and have made them, so if the pillars of how we use technology to connect, but there's a ton of new technology that has to be built for these specific use cases.

260
00:47:15,815 --> 00:47:29,915
We are just embarking a lot of different challenges and I think as technologists as folks that build as folks that create our job, is to figure out how to improve those problems that we interact with our showing up into the Office.

261
00:47:29,915 --> 00:47:34,115
If I took a one-hour commute and my team is in there or is only two people in the office.

262
00:47:34,115 --> 00:47:41,215
That's a problem because I feel like I made this effort and showed up and it wasn't there or posting a company.

263
00:47:41,215 --> 00:47:43,215
All hands and saying, you know what?

264
00:47:43,215 --> 00:47:49,315
Like we're doing it on Zoom or Google me and it doesn't feel engaging, I don't feel the music, I don't feel the presence.

265
00:47:49,315 --> 00:47:56,315
I don't feel the energy that I want to feel that requires a new way of thinking and using technology to better, engage your employees.

266
00:47:56,615 --> 00:48:02,915
And how do you actually track engagement and reward your Police through the entire Journey?

267
00:48:03,115 --> 00:48:03,915
What does that look like?

268
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:12,315
Well, there's new technology that needs to be built, so I think like when we're looking at the Space is really about, you know, what is status quo?

269
00:48:12,315 --> 00:48:13,815
And the status quo, good enough.

270
00:48:13,915 --> 00:48:22,615
And I think all those who say no, like we're never satisfied with status quo, there's always a better way of doing it and you look at that employee communication employee management.

271
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:29,515
I think there's one side of it was technology base, but a lot of it is just, you know, conversation, we just had around policy.

272
00:48:29,715 --> 00:48:37,415
See around intentionality around investing in Middle managers because they're carrying a lot of weight on how to lead.

273
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:45,415
Well, you know, I think so many folks have become managers and this new world that they're just understanding.

274
00:48:45,415 --> 00:48:46,615
Like this is how we work.

275
00:48:46,815 --> 00:48:59,615
Now, if there was a different manager that never managed ever distribute the team before, and they always relied on seeing them in the office and engaging their body language and seeing them sort of walk in the door at 8:00 AM and walk out.

276
00:48:59,715 --> 00:49:03,315
At 5 PM and sort of that's how they measure success.

277
00:49:03,915 --> 00:49:07,415
Even have a hard time if they don't change the way that they work.

278
00:49:07,415 --> 00:49:12,715
And I think so equip Ting middle managers is important and will keep seeing.

279
00:49:12,715 --> 00:49:13,915
I mean, we're talking about the future here.

280
00:49:13,915 --> 00:49:20,115
We will keep seeing how technology evolves to solve the problems that we're all feeling, but it's a fun, it's a fun.

281
00:49:20,315 --> 00:49:21,515
It's a fun place to be.

282
00:49:21,515 --> 00:49:27,215
I think a lot of times we get it, we get on these conversations and it's it feels like heavy and it feels.

283
00:49:27,415 --> 00:49:31,315
But I am so excited to of the future of like the future of work.

284
00:49:31,315 --> 00:49:33,015
I get to see my kids grow up.

285
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:34,515
I don't need to be in traffic.

286
00:49:34,515 --> 00:49:38,415
I can listen to Joe Rogan if I wanted to, when I go for a run worth is like in the car.

287
00:49:38,615 --> 00:49:43,315
There're other ways to get to your pocket as there're other ways to engage in work.

288
00:49:43,315 --> 00:49:45,015
And that's, that's what we're doing.

289
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:51,715
Anyway, I will shut up now because I can I get on my soapbox and just keep talking here but Gina hold me back.

290
00:49:52,715 --> 00:49:53,615
We love it.

291
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:56,215
How about you Robert Jason?

292
00:49:56,815 --> 00:49:57,515
Any thoughts?

293
00:49:57,815 --> 00:50:03,415
Yeah, I can maybe lend a mini experience sharing in a now on this.

294
00:50:03,415 --> 00:50:07,915
I have the deep personal passion and like, understanding like, what is the most simple?

295
00:50:07,915 --> 00:50:12,315
Most elegant system and process to create alignment and motivation inside of team.

296
00:50:12,515 --> 00:50:13,115
And what?

297
00:50:13,115 --> 00:50:15,415
That's a preface, but by no means am.

298
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:17,315
I what I am about to share the answer.

299
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:18,215
It's just one answer.

300
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:21,315
We found, so I don't to be prescriptive and saying, what we're doing is the best way.

301
00:50:21,815 --> 00:50:28,215
But for example, I think when it comes, Bringing people together getting them aligned and excited and motivated again.

302
00:50:28,215 --> 00:50:34,415
It, it's what I was mentioning earlier about having a really compelling Vision to share just a few details of what we do and there's salt.

303
00:50:34,415 --> 00:50:38,715
There's lots of resources on this topic, we have something called a Nutter traditional Vision.

304
00:50:38,715 --> 00:50:40,715
We have a three-year vision is called a painted picture.

305
00:50:41,015 --> 00:50:46,015
If you Google handed pitcher or Vivid Vision, there're all sorts of cool resources on how to create your own Vivid Vision.

306
00:50:46,215 --> 00:50:52,715
But it's like a forward-looking statement of what you envision the company to look like in the future and it's very descriptive, very colorful.

307
00:50:53,215 --> 00:51:12,215
And what we do to really bring Get to Life as we send it to every single new job applicant who comes to the organization to get given a sense, or a taste, as to what we're all about, to get them excited and then to celebrate the journey, because I think one thing we as entrepreneurs sometimes use, we don't celebrate the journey enough, won't celebrate those big wings and Milestones or this is what been one of my failings in the past.

308
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:18,115
So every quarter, we bring up our vision, and we celebrate the wins, and we do it via storytelling.

309
00:51:18,115 --> 00:51:20,315
So we will highlight individual employees.

310
00:51:20,815 --> 00:51:30,015
We anchor and how that person's contributions helped us achieve one of Our goals are rocks, from this longer-term vision and then from the vision, everything else falls out from there.

311
00:51:30,015 --> 00:51:46,315
So we do your legal setting using okay, our framework we do quarterly goal-setting again with okrs we do weekly management meetings using something called that an l 10 frameworks, which is like a really well-defined super-tight meeting to make sure people are aligned motivated and removing rocks and barriers that come up.

312
00:51:46,415 --> 00:51:51,215
So I think one of my favorite books and all that is, there's one called traction.

313
00:51:51,215 --> 00:51:54,715
Another one called cos the entrepreneurial operating Mmm.

314
00:51:55,015 --> 00:52:05,915
And so there's lots of good tools and systems that enable, I think a high-performing organization, but a specifically these tools in my experience are really impactful in the remote or distributed workplace.

315
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:07,415
Yeah.

316
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:11,715
Anyways, those are kind of my to limit my favorite tools and tips.

317
00:52:12,015 --> 00:52:16,915
But alas, what were the to the entrepreneurial operating system?

318
00:52:17,015 --> 00:52:20,715
There's a book called traction, which talks a lot about that and then, okay.

319
00:52:20,715 --> 00:52:27,715
Ours, for example, I am sure many, many of us are familiar, familiar those Whether you call them, okay, ours, rocks or Boulders, lots of tools.

320
00:52:27,715 --> 00:52:32,915
And then the final one is called a painted picture or Vivid Vision, just give it a Google.

321
00:52:32,915 --> 00:52:41,415
There's an author out there and in Cameron Harold, who's built, you know, taking companies from a million to 100 million in three years using the kind of vision framework.

322
00:52:42,115 --> 00:52:47,215
And as an entrepreneur in a company's actually really fun putting one together because there are quite colorful and playful.

323
00:52:49,915 --> 00:52:51,115
Thank you, that's great.

324
00:52:51,415 --> 00:53:04,815
How about you rob that I think first of all a bunch of really great tips from Jason and from Roberto on this, I will just add a little bit which is, you know, I think we naturally quite often.

325
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:13,015
I think we spent a lot of time talking about some of like the hardware stuff that's required and I don't mean how hard we're just in terms of wine, you know, like the kind of like physical assets or Machinery.

326
00:53:13,015 --> 00:53:18,815
I mean, in terms of like also like how do you put in place the Right video conferencing technology right?

327
00:53:18,815 --> 00:53:20,915
Or kind of operating Stems are things like that.

328
00:53:21,015 --> 00:53:29,415
The choice that we built, for example, but I think half of that also is like around the, the software so to speak of like, how do you get this stuff right?

329
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:44,415
And, and, and the way that I would describe it is, you know if I had to guess prior to the pandemic, maybe 1 in every 1,000 to 10,000 managers and ever managed hybrid tea before, like, you know if you were to look at scale across that, right?

330
00:53:44,415 --> 00:53:55,715
Like in so relative Collective knowledge and best practices and what that even means was like relatively minimal and Roberto is starting to like allude to this a little bit and talking about like, how do you think about management?

331
00:53:55,715 --> 00:54:00,515
But collectively managers have to get better in this world?

332
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:05,415
They have to be better managers like, on average than they were in a world where everybody's in the office every day.

333
00:54:05,815 --> 00:54:23,915
If everyone in the office every day, you can use generally crappy signals to figure out whether people are kind of like, you know, executing against their job clocking in and clocking out, you can look over them right, in a world where folks are hybrid, or But you have to be better, which means that you have to be more thoughtful around, what's the output?

334
00:54:23,915 --> 00:54:27,515
We're trying to drive how to folks in the team contribute to that.

335
00:54:27,615 --> 00:54:31,615
How do I find the right balance and checking in personally and professionally and supporting?

336
00:54:32,115 --> 00:54:47,015
And, so I think it, one of the things that I spend a lot of time thinking about is, like, not only how do you, I kind of coach and train on this topic with managers and here, we do our monthly manager discussions to understand what stuff of mine team and cover other topics around performance or compensation and things like that over time.

337
00:54:47,915 --> 00:54:50,515
But also like, how do you think About as a manager?

338
00:54:50,515 --> 00:54:54,515
Like what are the tips and tricks you start to arm them with to get better at this stuff, right?

339
00:54:54,515 --> 00:54:58,715
Like, can I give them better kind of customized training to having one on ones?

340
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:01,415
But folks who are they don't see very often?

341
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:05,015
Can we start to bring data over time?

342
00:55:05,015 --> 00:55:07,115
And in one of the things I think that we're very excited about it.

343
00:55:07,115 --> 00:55:13,615
Scoop is if I can marry overtime data around, how often folks are in the office, right?

344
00:55:13,915 --> 00:55:18,415
With kind of like how we do in terms of recognition, are we only promoting folks?

345
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:28,615
For example, that we see, Often, because we haven't learned how to be good at recognizing folks that we don't see as often as, and you can turn that into training opportunities and coaching for managers.

346
00:55:28,615 --> 00:55:30,615
Like, I think that stuff becomes really powerful.

347
00:55:30,615 --> 00:55:34,015
And so in addition to the hardware stuff I think is really, really important.

348
00:55:34,015 --> 00:55:47,415
I think there's this element of commitment as Executives and is companies to helping our people leaders get better in this world and manage to outcomes effectively, which just could take time and practice and best practice.

349
00:55:47,415 --> 00:55:49,515
Distillation, they come with lots.

350
00:55:49,615 --> 00:55:53,415
Lots and lots of organizations and teams practicing this, you know, and learning from each other.

351
00:55:55,415 --> 00:55:56,315
That's right on.

352
00:55:56,715 --> 00:56:03,415
I think that soft skill side of things is definitely something the hardware and the software, I like that a lot.

353
00:56:03,915 --> 00:56:05,815
It's definitely something that we're all learning.

354
00:56:05,915 --> 00:56:08,715
As we're figuring this management out.

355
00:56:08,715 --> 00:56:11,515
We have a question, we're actually getting a ton of questions in queue.

356
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:13,115
A thank you everybody for dropping them in.

357
00:56:13,115 --> 00:56:14,415
They're going to try to cover these.

358
00:56:15,115 --> 00:56:16,515
So what's relevant to?

359
00:56:16,515 --> 00:56:17,615
What we're talking about.

360
00:56:17,615 --> 00:56:21,015
Beat you carry on, here's an up, bow to question.

361
00:56:21,315 --> 00:56:21,615
Katie.

362
00:56:21,615 --> 00:56:39,015
If you don't mind pulling on a stage, how the roles for managers Eve all of in the distributed World from what they focused on in physical offices, Yeah, I think we sort of covered a little bit of this in the conversation around outcomes being more outcome is driven than anything else.

363
00:56:39,015 --> 00:56:52,315
The signals that Rob talks about these poor signals of like you know, presence being a measurement or how you know, sort of like extroverted you are how loud you are.

364
00:56:52,315 --> 00:56:55,615
Whatever it is no longer a signal, all right.

365
00:56:55,615 --> 00:57:04,515
I think it's more intention around having managers that understand the importance of that check-in, I think The important when you're meeting with.

366
00:57:05,915 --> 00:57:07,915
Your employees on one-on-one basis.

367
00:57:07,915 --> 00:57:15,615
If we're assuming that more flexibility, means that you also have more ownership of your space, meaning that you might have fewer meetings.

368
00:57:15,715 --> 00:57:19,915
That means that the meetings times that you do have you have to make them count.

369
00:57:20,015 --> 00:57:41,515
And so having the ability to approach a conversation with an employee and not just checking off the list of work-related things, but checking in on the person themselves and how, and how they're doing and how they're Managing all the things because you're not seeing the micro kitchen interaction.

370
00:57:41,515 --> 00:57:42,715
You're not seeing that person.

371
00:57:42,715 --> 00:57:46,715
There's no longer going to the micro kitchen engaging with other employees.

372
00:57:46,715 --> 00:57:47,615
Like they always do.

373
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:57,115
So those missed opportunities of Engagement requires you to lean in and more to understand how employees are actually doing.

374
00:57:57,115 --> 00:57:57,415
Is that?

375
00:57:57,415 --> 00:58:05,515
So I think, I think managers have to be equipped differently in a distributed Workforce and understand.

376
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:15,115
The importance of weaning into those intentional conversations drawing off of your employees, what's happening, and how to be proactive.

377
00:58:15,115 --> 00:58:26,115
And not just unblocking but having a conversation with your employee when you see and sense the signals sort of piling up where you can have an employee.

378
00:58:26,115 --> 00:58:29,215
That's always small example, right?

379
00:58:29,215 --> 00:58:35,515
For folks that are jumping into a zoom call right after this, but you can have an employee that you always know has brought good energy.

380
00:58:35,615 --> 00:58:45,515
To a meeting is always greeting folks, or having the small talk, and if that person you're noticing, is not doing that as often as a manager.

381
00:58:45,515 --> 00:58:52,915
Now, you have to pay attention to that and follow up and check on that employee versus, you know, just talking it up.

382
00:58:52,915 --> 00:58:56,115
As, you know, they're just not vocal anymore.

383
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:58,215
They're just not leaving in like the way they used to.

384
00:58:58,515 --> 00:59:02,115
So, I think at a high level, I think that there needs to be investment middle managers.

385
00:59:02,115 --> 00:59:05,115
I think it goes from a training and policy.

386
00:59:05,615 --> 00:59:09,815
Active tooling perspective and is the work to be done, right?

387
00:59:09,815 --> 00:59:11,015
As we're all engaging in this.

388
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:23,215
And now on the flip side, yes, there hasn't been many managers leading remote teams, but then there's also companies who have also been leading remote teams for a long time.

389
00:59:23,215 --> 00:59:25,015
And there's best practices out there.

390
00:59:25,215 --> 00:59:35,215
So if you're looking for like the playbooks and how to lead remote teams, there's ton of resources, you can go to get lab first as a see what they're doing on their side.

391
00:59:35,215 --> 00:59:35,515
Always.

392
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:41,915
Your HR also has public playbooks as well on how to structure these meetings in these conversations.

393
00:59:42,115 --> 00:59:45,015
So there're resources out there but yes, no doubt.

394
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:50,015
The rows of managers are evolving and us that are leading.

395
00:59:50,015 --> 00:59:53,515
These companies are thinking about this stuff are asking the question.

396
00:59:53,515 --> 00:59:56,015
How do I clipped that middle manager?

397
00:59:56,515 --> 01:00:03,215
Well, I love to ask just like a tactical question to you all, you know, Roberto.

398
01:00:03,215 --> 01:00:10,815
I think what you mentioned was that you can sense when folks maybe our disengaging a little bit and their signals.

399
01:00:11,915 --> 01:00:16,015
What are the things that each of you look for in your leadership team?

400
01:00:16,015 --> 01:00:22,915
Like how you know, we're what's a majority of our time remote, you're just seeing somebody in this little virtual box.

401
01:00:23,215 --> 01:00:25,715
So how are you picking up those cues?

402
01:00:26,615 --> 01:00:28,015
I would love to share, it's funny.

403
01:00:28,115 --> 01:00:40,915
That's I think a great area to dig deeper and all, maybe share some experiences and questions we used to unearth those both probably very meaningful and important feelings to Anchor into the context.

404
01:00:40,915 --> 01:00:47,315
I read this article, it was like from Ink or Forbes and it was from a fortune like ten CEO, and she's like, here's a top 10 questions.

405
01:00:47,315 --> 01:00:51,015
I ask all my Executives at a rather questions, like these are fantastic.

406
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:55,315
And, so I copied them, and they pasted them into, we call it a goal, set and review.

407
01:00:55,315 --> 01:00:59,615
It's a just a weekly 121 between every team lead and the employee.

408
01:00:59,815 --> 01:01:00,915
And we have about 10 questions.

409
01:01:00,915 --> 01:01:05,115
We run through to dig deeper into like the real meaningful stuff of life.

410
01:01:05,115 --> 01:01:14,015
And so, for example, some of the questions we asked one of them is like, what's the best thing that happened to you this week either at work or outside of work.

411
01:01:14,115 --> 01:01:18,315
So, kind of opening it up, making it, making it safe for people to talk outside of work or in work.

412
01:01:18,715 --> 01:01:20,715
And I have had some amazing Revelations.

413
01:01:20,715 --> 01:01:28,315
I have had people like One account executive, Tom told me that after quite a long time with trying him and his wife finally were able to you know, get pregnant.

414
01:01:28,515 --> 01:01:34,715
Instead, they're going to have a new baby, the September, I had another girl Lauren choose from our customer success.

415
01:01:34,715 --> 01:01:41,715
Team, tell me about her, the trials and tribulations of an upcoming wedding and how was creating a lot of stress in her work life?

416
01:01:41,915 --> 01:01:45,515
And then afterwards, I was able to catch up and find out what find out about.

417
01:01:45,515 --> 01:01:49,115
What an amazing day that was another?

418
01:01:49,115 --> 01:01:54,015
I think even better, but subtle question is to ask people on a scale of 1 to 10.

419
01:01:54,015 --> 01:01:55,815
How happy are you, how happy are you?

420
01:01:55,815 --> 01:01:56,415
And why?

421
01:01:56,615 --> 01:01:59,415
Like a lot of times, we walk around a life where Okay, how are you doing?

422
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:05,015
And somebody can say fine, but in their, in their reality, maybe they're struggling to pay rent, so maybe their dad, just died.

423
01:02:05,015 --> 01:02:18,715
But fine is the same answer across the board, but when you ask for a number out of 10, like they're going to give you a 3 or a 6, or a 9 and then you can dig deeper again it kind of creates this moment of safety to ask a follow-up question.

424
01:02:18,715 --> 01:02:20,415
Like hey you want to share more about that.

425
01:02:21,115 --> 01:02:26,915
Something else is really interesting around the asking how somebody is out of ten as I found people have different baselines.

426
01:02:26,915 --> 01:02:28,315
Some people are naturally a 7.

427
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:34,715
210 week over week, some people are a 9 out of 10 and you can kind of in your own head, kind of watch that trend line go up or down.

428
01:02:35,015 --> 01:02:42,615
If somebody goes from like, say at 92 a 5 or 4 for a couple weeks, there's something really important in your life, that you should be digging deeper in on.

429
01:02:43,915 --> 01:02:48,815
And then, lastly, I think, you know, under this for the sake of transparency, just Global Leadership.

430
01:02:48,815 --> 01:02:53,215
We always ask the question, how can I be a better leader like if you like it?

431
01:02:53,215 --> 01:03:03,815
I think, in any communication, you have to open it up and make it truly two ways and in my experience, You won't get a lot of answers to that but when you do it's really heartfelt and there's these great learning moments.

432
01:03:03,815 --> 01:03:09,815
And again it's about creating this High trust relationships where people could communicate and go deeper and build long deep.

433
01:03:09,815 --> 01:03:12,515
Meaningful relationships at work.

434
01:03:12,615 --> 01:03:17,515
So those are a few of the questions we asked, but I love to hear from Rob's take on this as well.

435
01:03:19,615 --> 01:03:20,215
I think it's great.

436
01:03:20,215 --> 01:03:30,315
I will just add a short one, so we can cut you because I think you guys covered it extremely well, I think one thing that becomes really important to hit our thinking around.

437
01:03:30,315 --> 01:03:41,215
When you move into a more hybrid or distributed or remote type of environment is your managers kind of like and I think we're going to describe as like middle management.

438
01:03:41,215 --> 01:03:47,715
I would think about is like anybody do basically is a, you know, is from managing a direct team to managing man.

439
01:03:47,915 --> 01:04:15,315
Jurors for example, but maybe is not part of executive leadership or kind of like a direct report of the CEO, for example, like they don't just have an important role and kind of like translating top-down thinking or priorities down to the team but actually I think in a hybrid and remote World, their ability to Bubble Up relative sentiment and what's working and not working upward is actually far more important even than it was Prior you know in terms of different models.

440
01:04:15,315 --> 01:04:22,715
And the reason why is that it's kind of like A fairly simple one which is you know we used to all be in the office.

441
01:04:22,715 --> 01:04:29,015
I can walk around or you could walk around you kind of like pick up little signals on energy.

442
01:04:29,015 --> 01:04:30,715
Facial expressions, Etc.

443
01:04:30,715 --> 01:04:32,415
You grab someone for two minutes.

444
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:40,315
Like the amount of people, I think people ground, so to speak that you can cover, you know, in a day when everybody's in the office is quite extensive, right?

445
01:04:42,015 --> 01:04:46,415
When everyone is not in the office, every day is actually a bit harder to clean that signal, right?

446
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:49,715
And the folks that actually Your most likely to get clear.

447
01:04:49,715 --> 01:04:56,315
And true signal is a Frontline manager who may have built that relationship and a one-on-one and be able to sing to get that.

448
01:04:56,615 --> 01:05:14,115
But if you don't create a space where there's comfort and manager, raising that up and being like, hey, look, I am noticing a couple of things in my team, you know, that maybe other folks might be seeing as well, and then create the right Forum to be able to share that information to, hey, look, is that emblematic of some bigger issue, culturally or operationally?

449
01:05:14,115 --> 01:05:15,715
That we need to fix that.

450
01:05:15,715 --> 01:05:17,715
I think getting this right gets a lot harder.

451
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:21,015
So tactical advice around.

452
01:05:21,015 --> 01:05:45,015
That is one, make an effort from the way you talked about culture and great culture to make managers feel like it's a safe space to Bubble Up concerns that they're hearing from front lines, you know, in terms of what's working or not working or how they're feeling to we use our monthly people manager forums, as I mentioned is a way of saying, hey look, we have a dedicated item on the agenda every month which is just like, what are we hearing?

453
01:05:45,515 --> 01:05:47,715
What's coming up from direct reports what our issues?

454
01:05:47,815 --> 01:05:49,315
Is how we're folks dealing?

455
01:05:49,315 --> 01:05:51,615
Are we seeing that in one place kind of in?

456
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:55,915
Its just idiosyncratic to that place or is it widespread across all manager groups?

457
01:05:56,115 --> 01:06:07,115
But if you don't create that space for like that, really critical information, the bubble up, you can lose signal really fast, and not recognize an issue, or a cultural problem or something else.

458
01:06:07,115 --> 01:06:12,715
And so, you really have to empower managers to operate, kind of like two ways in that regard.

459
01:06:14,815 --> 01:06:16,415
It's really good.

460
01:06:16,415 --> 01:06:25,715
So being able to create those feedback loops and that safety, ultimately that, that safety for the middle management layer to be able to bubble that up.

461
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:27,115
That's great.

462
01:06:27,115 --> 01:06:33,815
All right, we have got only 10 minutes, believe you're not in our panel time, and we still have some questions here from the audience.

463
01:06:33,815 --> 01:06:36,215
I would love to tackle one, that's being upvoted.

464
01:06:36,215 --> 01:06:42,615
Pretty high as from wisdom, how do you engage remote employees to stay ahead in the retention battle?

465
01:06:45,715 --> 01:06:46,915
Anyone feel free to jump in.

466
01:06:49,515 --> 01:06:53,115
It's a, okay, I can share some hybrid perspective on it.

467
01:06:53,115 --> 01:06:55,015
But why don't you take remote Roberto if you want to?

468
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:56,615
I can talk a little bit more about the hybrid element.

469
01:06:56,615 --> 01:06:56,915
Rob.

470
01:06:56,915 --> 01:06:57,315
I wasn't.

471
01:06:57,415 --> 01:06:59,115
I was just going to just pass the ball to you.

472
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:01,915
So you go ahead and jump in, all right?

473
01:07:01,915 --> 01:07:12,315
Well, so I will talk a little bit, maybe about from a hybrid perspective, which is probably where we spend more energy thinking about it and that I think they will be certain pieces of that, the better applicable to remote to, and you can talk more about it.

474
01:07:12,315 --> 01:07:17,215
But I think, you know, maybe this ties to into something that may be another.

475
01:07:17,315 --> 01:07:36,415
Folk Minds, if, if the whole focus of this conversation, the way we think about how work is evolving is related to flexibility, I certainly don't think the answer is kind of being overly rigid, you know in a non-intentional way in terms of like where and how people do their work.

476
01:07:36,815 --> 01:07:47,215
And one of the interesting things that we started to find is there be discussions from companies or announcements as hey, I want everybody in the office you know, on Tuesdays.

477
01:07:47,315 --> 01:07:50,915
Traditional everybody to, you know, to be in the office during these times.

478
01:07:50,915 --> 01:07:56,315
And, yeah, I think what I found so far, and he kind of shows up consistently, not just in our users.

479
01:07:56,315 --> 01:08:02,015
But in research that I have seen is people want to be treated like adults, you know?

480
01:08:02,015 --> 01:08:17,115
And if there's one thing that really happened during the pandemic, it's folks, proved pretty concretely that they can be incredibly effective without having to be in the office and so if you tell them, I need you back in the office and that doesn't sound like a real.

481
01:08:17,314 --> 01:08:20,314
Real reason or there's not like some intentionality around it.

482
01:08:20,415 --> 01:08:25,415
People cry foul pretty fast and given the opportunities around distributive work.

483
01:08:25,814 --> 01:08:31,215
One data point that I found really interesting that came out of LinkedIn was something like hitting gone from at one point.

484
01:08:31,215 --> 01:08:40,015
Two percent of the jobs posted on LinkedIn, had a remote eligible to something like 25% and if you just think about the math of that it really over simplified terms.

485
01:08:40,314 --> 01:08:47,115
It means that the average person has like 10x 20x, the number of opportunities available to them because of remote work.

486
01:08:47,314 --> 01:08:51,515
Used to be available before and so people just aren't going to be here for that.

487
01:08:51,715 --> 01:08:52,715
They're not right?

488
01:08:52,715 --> 01:09:04,015
And so the biggest piece of advice they give to companies is like communicate like the thinking behind why you want folks to do what they do and make sure there's some intentionality around it, right?

489
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:11,615
And if you can give that flexibility at the team level or the department level to kind of figure out their own Norms based on what works well for them.

490
01:09:11,615 --> 01:09:17,115
And folks can operate within that instead of saying, hey, look blanket across the company, you know, I see.

491
01:09:17,314 --> 01:09:20,814
Yeah, I think it's good for people to be in the office three days a week and that works with my schedule.

492
01:09:20,814 --> 01:09:29,615
So everybody's going to do that, people say not for me, you know, I am going to go elsewhere, I think that happens really fast, and so I think that's one way to kind of stay ahead of it.

493
01:09:30,515 --> 01:09:41,015
And the other thing that's top of mind for me is like when I think this does really fast, you have remote and hybrid work cultures, is it shines a light on Mike relative quality of culture really quickly?

494
01:09:41,314 --> 01:09:47,115
Because in a world where I can be at my laptop in sign out of one flag account and sign into somebody else.

495
01:09:47,314 --> 01:09:50,115
Black accounts and effectively have switched companies, right?

496
01:09:50,115 --> 01:09:53,015
Like something around vision and Mission.

497
01:09:53,015 --> 01:09:54,715
And why do we do the work that we do?

498
01:09:54,715 --> 01:09:58,015
And the impact went to have on the world becomes really, really important.

499
01:09:58,015 --> 01:10:01,215
And so companies have to invest in that and Clarity.

500
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,015
And like why are we here?

501
01:10:03,015 --> 01:10:04,515
And why is this important?

502
01:10:04,615 --> 01:10:07,015
And are we hiring people that are values aligned?

503
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,415
Because otherwise, we're just gonna go, right?

504
01:10:09,415 --> 01:10:14,815
There's just too many opportunities out there and the whole strength of your culture and the differentiation around.

505
01:10:14,815 --> 01:10:16,915
That is one of the things that will keep people engaged.

506
01:10:20,715 --> 01:10:21,415
So good.

507
01:10:21,615 --> 01:10:22,615
Thank you rob.

508
01:10:23,115 --> 01:10:26,615
All right, we're going to answer another question here from Stephanie Jones.

509
01:10:26,615 --> 01:10:34,515
How do you support remote workers in setting up their physical office space to reduce physical pain symptoms?

510
01:10:34,515 --> 01:10:36,815
We are seeing increases of that, right?

511
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:39,015
Lower back pain, neck pain, Etc.

512
01:10:41,115 --> 01:10:47,115
This is an interesting one we hosted in one of our event series here called changing how we work.

513
01:10:47,115 --> 01:10:53,315
We host it, Chris heard, who is a CEO of a company called first base.

514
01:10:53,715 --> 01:11:06,315
First base .h, I mean, first base hq.com, I think, is this, there is their website and what they basically do is like, they equipped the remote employee with their office fittings, right?

515
01:11:06,315 --> 01:11:09,615
So I think it's really important that companies.

516
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:18,415
Not just hire folks who remotely but think about how do they equip them in their space to be a safe space?

517
01:11:18,515 --> 01:11:20,315
Like get the to office chair.

518
01:11:20,315 --> 01:11:20,915
Yes, it costs.

519
01:11:20,915 --> 01:11:23,215
A few hundred bucks, get the standing desk.

520
01:11:23,315 --> 01:11:25,215
Yes, it costs a few hundred bucks.

521
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:28,715
Get the right keyboard, get the right Mouse, invest in those things.

522
01:11:28,715 --> 01:11:36,515
Give employees, The Hit List of the best products to make sure that they have the best setup, so they can do their best work.

523
01:11:37,315 --> 01:11:39,815
So I think it's one investing actual dollars.

524
01:11:39,915 --> 01:11:42,215
To help employees do that.

525
01:11:42,315 --> 01:11:45,915
And I think S I think that in this is an area to improve.

526
01:11:45,915 --> 01:12:14,015
I think it's Car Technology out there but there's got to be ways to actually educate also in train folks on the best practices on getting up, moving around, you know, the small tip there's in your Google calendar, there's something called I think Speedy mint meetings and it basically forces your meetings from Two minutes to 25 minutes from 60 Minutes to 50 minutes.

527
01:12:14,015 --> 01:12:20,215
So that always gives you five minutes for every 30 minutes back and it also gives you 10 minutes for every 60 Minutes back.

528
01:12:20,515 --> 01:12:22,615
And so, the question is, how do you use that?

529
01:12:22,715 --> 01:12:27,515
All right, take a break, go for the coffee, walk around, do those things.

530
01:12:27,515 --> 01:12:40,615
So I think it goes both ways, not just on the equipment having the right setup, but also the training that for a better way of working from home, That's great.

531
01:12:40,615 --> 01:12:41,715
Thanks, Roberto.

532
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:45,115
Alright I am going to keep tackling these questions because we got five minutes left.

533
01:12:45,115 --> 01:12:48,615
Alright, so here's an interesting one.

534
01:12:49,715 --> 01:12:52,915
Do you find that on boarding and training remote?

535
01:12:52,915 --> 01:13:00,115
Employees are more challenging than in office employees, especially for employees right out of school?

536
01:13:02,715 --> 01:13:06,715
I would, I would say in my experience, absolutely.

537
01:13:08,415 --> 01:13:14,215
We because you're not face-to-face, it doesn't allow for those micro conversations.

538
01:13:14,215 --> 01:13:19,315
As micro-moments could pop up where people can chat between each other and allow you to rapidly fix an issue issues.

539
01:13:19,315 --> 01:13:20,615
Might kind of simmer below the surface.

540
01:13:22,215 --> 01:13:32,615
Something we did is we just took the time to like map out the entire onboarding experience starting with like the first job interview are actually part of me even before that is looking at our curb page on our website.

541
01:13:32,715 --> 01:13:37,415
In like mapping it from sort of 0 to 10, is a good experience, or a bad experience.

542
01:13:37,715 --> 01:13:40,715
And once that was all mapped out where able to pinpoint where we're strong and weak.

543
01:13:40,715 --> 01:13:49,815
So I was like, step one and step two, we created like a really specific repeatable onboarding Playbook, which is like is pretty darn granular.

544
01:13:49,815 --> 01:13:54,015
And some of the cool things we use like tools, like doughnut till I was serendipitous conversations.

545
01:13:54,015 --> 01:13:59,815
We have like the day one of Jenna's mapped out hour by hour for every single employee.

546
01:14:01,615 --> 01:14:02,515
In fact, the whole weeks.

547
01:14:02,615 --> 01:14:05,815
Opt hour by hour from sort of day 1 to day 7.

548
01:14:06,015 --> 01:14:08,315
So we have all these consistent repeatable processes.

549
01:14:08,315 --> 01:14:15,515
And then we also collect feedback on day 30 and a 60, or employees can fill out a survey like how good of a job did we do on our onboarding changes?

550
01:14:15,715 --> 01:14:19,215
Because if you don't measure it, you can't truly prove whether it's working or not.

551
01:14:19,415 --> 01:14:25,215
But those are kind of three steps we have taken mostly because we wanted to get ahead of like get ahead.

552
01:14:25,315 --> 01:14:27,215
We didn't want to bad onboarding experience.

553
01:14:27,215 --> 01:14:33,015
That I have heard some stories where we previously been doing a good job, and we also have you delivered a Job?

554
01:14:33,015 --> 01:14:41,915
And that's really frustrating to me if I can't deliver that consistently great experience so that was the trigger for those kind of three processes that we rolled our internally.

555
01:14:43,315 --> 01:14:44,215
That's great.

556
01:14:44,415 --> 01:14:44,715
All right.

557
01:14:44,715 --> 01:14:45,815
Just do two time.

558
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:50,615
I don't think we could get to all the questions but I do want to ask a question of each of you.

559
01:14:51,415 --> 01:14:57,615
Of course, we're talking about predictions here and future, and so we I would love to hear from each of you.

560
01:14:58,215 --> 01:15:07,215
What is the one top prediction that you are excited about and you are prioritizing for your organization?

561
01:15:09,715 --> 01:15:14,715
Maybe there're two questions in there, but I would love to hear from each of you and I will start with you Rob.

562
01:15:18,815 --> 01:15:21,715
Top the top prediction that we're prioritizing organization.

563
01:15:22,015 --> 01:15:35,515
I think that the top prediction is that I think the majority of the world that is capable of working remotely will operate a hybrid environment time, not just next year, but into the future, right?

564
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:42,615
And I think the biggest barrier around that is purely going to be the ability to make it that people can work in the right place at the right time.

565
01:15:42,815 --> 01:15:46,815
You know, that your home on the right days or in the office on the right days you can get the right people together.

566
01:15:46,915 --> 01:15:55,215
So we spent all of Energy from a product perspective, trying to make that as easy as possible, which coincidentally is the biggest investment I can make in some ways in our own company?

567
01:15:55,215 --> 01:16:01,815
You know, how we do this internally to make that really easy for folks, to be able to get together the office at the right time or out of the right time.

568
01:16:01,815 --> 01:16:07,215
And so in my mind it's that hybrid is the future from majority of folks.

569
01:16:07,215 --> 01:16:09,815
I would say and intentionality around that.

570
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,315
I think it's just extremely Accord.

571
01:16:11,315 --> 01:16:13,015
That's what we're, that's what we're focused on.

572
01:16:13,115 --> 01:16:13,715
I am helping with.

573
01:16:15,415 --> 01:16:18,315
Thanks, I will head off to you Roberto Yeah, cool.

574
01:16:18,315 --> 01:16:33,115
I think it's in this future sort of like, thinking about what's happening like to think about a short-term or long-term, but I will stick to like, it just in between and I think that the in between is that there's going to be much more digital Nomads.

575
01:16:33,115 --> 01:16:41,815
There's going to be a lot of people that are just owning their careers and their part sizing life first, and then work.

576
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:45,315
And I think that's a big shift that is going to happen.

577
01:16:45,315 --> 01:16:47,415
Is, you know what, I want to live this life, dear.

578
01:16:47,615 --> 01:17:06,915
For I work this way and there's a journey and it cooked in people to think differently about that, not just employees, but employers, making sure that people know the expectations, making sure that there's this outcome driven, you do with your time, with to need to go do this, is, what's what Excellence looks like at the job.

579
01:17:07,115 --> 01:17:10,515
Go be excellent and go live, an excellent life on your terms.

580
01:17:10,615 --> 01:17:17,415
And I think that it's a foundation of trust and that's a big shift that still going to have to happen in employment.

581
01:17:17,515 --> 01:17:33,415
In general, it's like trusting employees to do their job, you hired him to do the job, give them clear expectations and let them go surf every day if they want to in the morning as long as the job gets done, Love that Jason close up.

582
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:37,015
Yeah, I think Roberto and Rob give fantastic answers.

583
01:17:37,015 --> 01:17:38,715
I gave a slightly quirky answer.

584
01:17:38,715 --> 01:17:44,515
I am fascinated by the future but I think because so many people are going into remote distributed hybrid environments.

585
01:17:44,515 --> 01:17:55,215
There's this really cool infrastructure change where transportation is going to get better new real estate and communities are going to grow but like whether its self-driving cars there's this really cool company called jobby.

586
01:17:55,215 --> 01:17:58,915
It's like this quadcopter that holds any between around for people.

587
01:17:58,915 --> 01:18:00,015
They're going to equip it with us.

588
01:18:00,215 --> 01:18:01,215
Flying model.

589
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:11,915
So I think how we get around we literally show up on the world will change making commute times faster and more exciting, and I am really excited about that feature so yeah that's my quirky answer that question.

590
01:18:12,915 --> 01:18:14,315
Thank you so much.

591
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:18,515
Each of you have shared some great insights resources and tips.

592
01:18:19,515 --> 01:18:24,015
We're very excited of how this next year will unfold.

593
01:18:24,215 --> 01:18:27,215
So, thank you, Roberto Rob and Jason.

594
01:18:27,415 --> 01:18:27,815

597
01:18:41,915 --> 01:18:47,415
It's going to be with Oyster Cult ramp and Roberto here, welcome.

598
01:18:47,915 --> 01:18:57,115

599
01:18:57,115 --> 01:18:58,315
