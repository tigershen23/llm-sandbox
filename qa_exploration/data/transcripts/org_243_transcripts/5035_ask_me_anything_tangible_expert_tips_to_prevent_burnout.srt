00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,800
Hi everyone, welcome to this event AMA style.

2
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:08,400
We are so excited to have you all here and talk about a very relevant topic on preventing burnout, very close near and dear to home.

3
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,200
And it's great to see people tuning in.

4
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,300
We have folks from Boulder, Chicago, Angelica from Fresno, California.

5
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,900
Hello, Joey from Minneapolis.

6
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,300
I see charlena from Puerto Rico and La Robin from Portland.

7
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,200
Love this.

8
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,700
Love that we're all over yet.

9
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,600
We're so close together here today.

10
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,100
So, just, you know, talking about burnout.

11
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,500
I was doing a little bit of research and the American Psychological Association survey.

12
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:48,900
There was one that was taken recently and a massive 79 percent of us workers, reported having a severe sense of work-related stress.

13
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,500
30% of those said they were struggling with emotional exhaustion.

14
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,300
Will fatigue lack of motivation at work and cognitive weariness.

15
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:11,900
So I am so excited about the panelists that we have today as they are the experts on the front lines, not only managing burn out for themselves, but also for their teammates at a company level, so we're going to hear from them.

16
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,200
But before we jump into that, a couple things to note.

17
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,000
Housekeeping wise, we have got to help tab.

18
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,000
So, if there's any technical issues, you encounter, feel free to chat us there.

19
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,300
There's also a volume and a close.

20
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,600
Captioning knob underneath the screen so you can flip those on or adjust the volume as you need to.

21
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,200
Alright, so we're going to start with a poll.

22
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,500
Jessica, my producer in the green room.

23
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,100
Could you put that pull up?

24
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,700
How burnt out?

25
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,800
Are you feeling?

26
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
And y'all can keep it real on a scale of one to ten.

27
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,100
This.

28
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,700
This is for you yourself.

29
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,000
We're not talking about teams.

30
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,500
We're not talking about company level.

31
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
We're just talking about you.

32
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,400
All right, this is real.

33
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,200
Wow, we have got some tens.

34
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,600
So it's some sevens.

35
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,400
Okay?

36
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,500
All right.

37
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,800
This is very real and I think all of us are feeling and experiencing this at this time.

38
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,100
So with that I would love to invite to the stage our panelists today.

39
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:20,800
Vicky VP of people off operations at bonus lie, Brittany head of recruiting Ops and employer brand at Breck's and our co-founder and CEO Roberto.

41
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:22,900
Hello.

42
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,500

44
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,000
Hello.

45
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,400
How are you?

46
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
All doing?

47
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,300
Hi everyone.

48
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,900
Hey folks, doing good?

49
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,600
Ready for this.

50
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,100
Good.

51
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,400
Good.

52
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,000
Good.

53
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,900
Yeah.

54
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,600
I am so excited to hear from each of you.

55
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,900
You know, we actually received up to 40 questions that were submitted in advance.

56
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,800
And so there's a lot of folks that are curious and have some questions around this.

57
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,600
Topic.

58
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:02,500
We went through all of those questions and identify the top 10 most burning questions, which we have under the Q&A tab right now.

59
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,600
So all attendees of this event, feel free to jump into that Q&A and upvote.

60
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,100
The question that is most burning to you.

61
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,400
In the meantime.

62
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,200
What we have done is broken down.

63
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,400
The questions under three categories.

64
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,900
One is managing burn out for yourself to is managing it for your team.

65
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,100
At that level and then three managing it at a company level.

66
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,600
And so, I wanted to get really real with each of you all as we tackle.

67
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:43,500
The first category of burnout for yourselves, you know, each of you are leading teams leading companies, and how are you all doing for real?

68
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,900
And how are you managing burn out for yourselves?

69
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,500
We're going to take it their guys.

70
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,500
I love that question Jenna and there's a friend of mine.

71
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:57,800
Actually.

72
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,300
He always asks, how are you really?

73
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,800
Really?

74
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,800
Because I think it's really easy to say I am fine and honestly the last two weeks.

75
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,200
I have not been fine.

76
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,000
It's been hard.

77
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,100
It's been really hard to kind of handle what's going on in the world and what was going on at home and then also still perform in the way that I want to put my job.

78
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,500
So definitely feeling it.

79
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,700
Belong wise.

80
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,200
I think there's a lot of different things.

81
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,700
I am doing.

82
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:31,600
Personally, therapies one of them and just kind of like learning and educating myself on kind of the things to do to take care of ourselves.

83
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I think, we sometimes know what those are in the back of our minds, but to actually be intentional about taking that time to do those things and seeing that the impact even a short period of time with it and how that helps, but then I will fall off the wagon, so to speak and not do it in the next week or so.

84
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,500
And I will be back in the same spot.

85
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,200
But yeah, constantly try to remind myself to do those things like working out reading watching shows.

86
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,400
I love that kind of thing.

87
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,600
Yeah, I think Vicki makes a really good point event.

88
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:12,200
However, was doing a few months ago has completely changed from how I am doing now, which has probably completely changed from last week.

89
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,500
So I think it's definitely not working at a start-up.

90
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,600
There's always so much to do there.

91
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,000
Always, especially when you're a manager, people manager.

92
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,600
You want to, you have so many things to think about in my developing, my team enough and I caught up on my projects at my am I giving it my best?

93
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:38,300
And I think sometimes that imposter syndrome starts to creep in which starts to lead to burnout because you feel like your list keeps getting longer and longer.

94
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:49,600
So I definitely have to remind myself to constantly check in with myself, and I am really big on reflecting on previous month's and kind of saying what went well what didn't what should I be doing more?

95
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:55,300
Of and sometimes it's I should be doing a lot more of self-care and I should be doing a lot more of what we call it.

96
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:06,000
Where ax is declaring meeting bankruptcy, which is reorganizing my calendar and getting rid of meetings that are not serving purpose and scheduling things like a walk with my dog.

97
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,300
I literally check weather.com every Monday.

98
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:18,600
And I look at the week and I figure out when I can get outside with my dog for a half hour just to decompress and you know, take a little reset between meetings.

99
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,100
So good.

100
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,800
That's good.

101
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,900
That's good.

102
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,500
Brittany.

103
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,900
I am just going to follow up on what you said.

104
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,300
They're around getting outside.

105
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,800
Well, first of all, I think you know, when Gina was putting together this panel and still response.

106
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,200
We got was fantastic.

107
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:42,900
So I am happy that everyone is here to learn and sort of learn from each other and share best practices and tips.

108
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,900
But really, you know, us as M A lot of times we feel burnt out, and we're trying to help burnt.

109
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,700
Employees.

110
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,900
All right, if we're honest and I think asking the question with the leader.

111
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:01,000
First, I think is really powerful question because we get to set the pace.

112
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,300
We get to set the president's, we get this like the example with our team's, right?

113
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:16,400
And so once a couple of small things that I do, I try to get outside every day, and I have been doing walking talks for 10 ones, and I encourage folks that I am speaking with it.

114
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,200
We don't really have to look at the screen.

115
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:18,900
Call me.

116
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,900
On my cell phone, and we're going to go for a walk and what I found doing this over the last couple months has been a game-changer for me because one you get good vitamin D.

117
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:38,700
But to I think it also the psyche changes in how you communicate with that person as well wherever from one Zoom meeting to another Zoo meeting.

118
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,400
Just pick up the phone and putting some are pods and going for a walk.

119
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,900
I don't know it just it makes a big difference and so overall though Gino when you ask that question, how are we?

120
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Burnout, I went back to thinking about my wife because I feel like it's like this family affair like to beat burnout.

121
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,000
It's like it's not just work.

122
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:07,000
It's like this holistic perspective that we have to take, and so we put boundaries up around it.

123
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,000
And now as a CEO that your phone is almost all like 24/7.

124
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,900
And so we had to, as a family, put the boundaries in place and say, you know what this time is for.

125
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,300
Family, so, I block out the time on my calendar.

126
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,800
That's like the golden hours, and I say, do not book.

127
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,000
And I, the block is actually in yellow and it is a reminder for me.

128
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Like these are the golden hours of the day.

129
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:41,600
When I get to spend with my two year old and my wife and is when we do dinner and when I, whenever I have to miss those idea tends to not be a good signal, right?

130
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,900
It tends to be too.

131
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're pushing things out.

132
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
They really, really matter that you said really matter.

133
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:55,200
And, that's That typically triggers me, go back and re-evaluate my time and my calendar and all these different things.

134
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,000
And so anyway, yeah burn.

135
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,100
I was real, I am here for to talk about it.

136
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,700
That's great.

137
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,000
Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing.

138
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,000
From each of you.

139
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
It's very insightful to hear.

140
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,700
What are the signs and triggers a burnout?

141
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,500
Are there signs that we could be looking at way before each of us are even feeling it?

142
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,400
I will kick off here if that's okay.

143
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,100
I, you know, getting ready for this conversation.

144
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:35,000
I just went online and just, you know what, how do people Define burnout like let us start with that.

145
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Like what is the definition of burnout?

146
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,400
And I think there's obvious.

147
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,200
There're two definitions.

148
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,700
Actually.

149
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,200
There's one that as people leaders there's definition in the space of HR and Leadership and foot with the posture of employees.

150
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,300
And then there's the Out from Webster's perspective, right?

151
00:14:53,300 --> 00:15:03,700
And so, on our side burnout is a state of emotional, physical and mental exhaustion, caused by excessive and prolonged stress.

152
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,700
That's where real we can all head.

153
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,200
Not to that.

154
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,700
Is that yep?

155
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:08,900
Yep.

156
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,100
Yep.

157
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,300
Yep.

158
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,500
Yep.

159
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:15,100
Yep, and then my mind went to okay with the what does Webster say?

160
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:29,600
And it's really interesting to correlation here is basically the reduction of fuel is being on empty, is a motor that has nothing else to give is your cup is fully empty and you don't have the fuel to operate.

161
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:38,400
It's another term is, you know, a mechanical device that failed it, overheated.

162
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,200
It's done the poop and it's like you.

163
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Look at those two terms that you have overlap them and a lot of them.

164
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,600
I mean, are super relevant to how people describe the feeling of burnout.

165
00:15:49,800 --> 00:16:08,500
And I think that when you're asking about the signs and triggers, you know, I went on to even do research in this area as well, because I want to be equipped for, and we're here, talking about it and I will just read out a couple of the things that people more professional than I am at this space at Keep their lives to this and helping people manage these things.

166
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,800
What they say are.

167
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Some of the signs that lead to burnout.

168
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
One is every day feels like a bad day.

169
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,600
When the day just feels like a bad day and it happens more often than you.

170
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Like when you start caring about things less things at work, things at home.

171
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,800
You think about is a waste of energy, doing X, Y, or Z.

172
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,000
When you feel exhausted all the time.

173
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:46,600
The time even if you had a good night's sleep and you still exhausted and the majority of your time is spent on tasks that feel overwhelming.

174
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,300
These are like some of those top signs that folks, relate to burnout.

175
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:58,200
And, so I think that pointing back to the question you were asking about signs and such.

176
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,500
I think we can all relate to those things.

177
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,800
Quite significantly in our, in our rows.

178
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,200
And so anyways, I felt like it was good to Anchor.

179
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,500
The conversation is Going with like what's the definition of it?

180
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Because I think it helps at framing there.

181
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:23,099
Yeah, I think it really if you think about the signs and triggers it varies so much person to person and I think, burnout and stress.

182
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,500
It's so unique to each individual.

183
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
That as a manager.

184
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,800
I would say first at with your own self.

185
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,100
You need to really know yourself and check in with yourself.

186
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:41,000
But as a manager, you need to really know your people and pay attention to them and observe how your team works.

187
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And I think what I have noticed with my Small team is.

188
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:58,600
I understand what their normal behaviors are, and I understand when things are starting to fall off a little bit and I had something happen on my team recently, where someone who never is probably the most detail-oriented person.

189
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:07,700
So strong with ownership, just was starting to slip on some details and I wondered if she happy and I asked her flat out.

190
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,400
Are you happy here?

191
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,800
And I just wanted to check in and ask how things were going and just kind of hearing her out.

192
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:22,200
I realized she's Has not taken a vacation day and four months and it was my fault for not recognizing that she has not really taken any time off.

193
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,500
And we have been doing so much work lately.

194
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,800
That I mean, we have were balancing a lot right now.

195
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,600
So I pushed her to in the next month.

196
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:47,800
I want to see you taking time off on the calendar, and she took five days off, and she spread it out over two weeks, but took five days off, went to Coachella had a great time, came back fully recharged, and I mean, It's like seeing a completely different person.

197
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:54,200
So I think by knowing that and being able to recognize that something was off and by asking them comfortable questions.

198
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,000
Are you happy here?

199
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,200
Because no manager wants to hear.

200
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,500
No.

201
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,400
I am not happy.

202
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
It led us to this point of realizing.

203
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,300
Okay.

204
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,700
You need to take some time off.

205
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,000
Let me you know, let me pick up the slack and make sure you're taking care of yourself.

206
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,000
I think the only thing I would add to that is just doubling down on that recognizing signals.

207
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,100
I think for yourself and in your team and straight out, also asking.

208
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,900
And I think it's a good exercise for yourself and your team to write down, like, what are, what are the responses?

209
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,000
You have to stress?

210
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,700
What does that look like?

211
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,900
Because I don't think we sit down and really think about it until it's almost too late.

212
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:43,400
When in fact, if you had kind of paid attention to it earlier, you could see those little things kind of happening over because it is repeated that kind of Some sort of stress, that kind of goes over and over again to can cause burnout.

213
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,500
So definitely, definitely ask and don't be afraid to ask the question.

214
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,900
I think there's actually a very tangible walk away with Vicki.

215
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:00,400
What you just said, as you're managing your, your remote teams, you could actually ask them and document.

216
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,200
These things about your team members and even for yourself.

217
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,300
It's, I noticed there were some journaling comments in the chat.

218
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,500
I think knowing yourself.

219
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:08,900
Okay.

220
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,000
These are the triggers.

221
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,200
These are the things that make me stressed out.

222
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,700
It actually does the act of writing it down.

223
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Typing it out.

224
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,700
Can, it can really help.

225
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,600
Great inputs.

226
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,100
Now, there was a question that came up.

227
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,700
How do we differentiate burnout from stress, or a mental health issue?

228
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,000
Any takers on that one.

229
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,500
I will take a stab at this one because I think this is something.

230
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:45,900
I have thought a lot about when I saw this question come in because I think it's tough because it's not like their three different line items.

231
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,800
There's a lot of, I mean, there's a lot of similarities.

232
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,800
They think stress is something as I said before, all individuals deal with, it's really unique to themselves.

233
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,500
The triggers are different from one person to another.

234
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,100
And I think it's a lot about, you know, overall perception of pressure.

235
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:09,400
But it's connected to burnout because it really depends on how you manage your stress and how you let it affect you.

236
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,800
How you, you know, how much you are handling it, and how you're handling it.

237
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:20,500
And then I think, at the end of the day, burnout can eventually lead to mental health.

238
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:43,800
I think this is where, if you're not managing that stress, if you're not setting boundaries similar to what, you know, I think just talking about calendar blocks before Like if you are not setting those boundaries for family time for gym time, you are taking on too much and it gets to the point where you really need to like take a step back and think about how can I Implement?

239
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,700
Some really strong self care practices and figure out what works for you.

240
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,900
I mean, I am someone who sometimes I will let things build up, build up.

241
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,500
And then I am like, okay, you know, I need to come working super late one night.

242
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,500
I need to sleep in a little bit longer tomorrow.

243
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,500
I need to make carve out time for the gym that day.

244
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:13,600
But it's, you know, strut if what leads to poor mental health is when you're really not able to recognize those limits and take a step back, and I think we have all been there before.

245
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:21,800
And I have personally been there before where I have needed to take that step back and whether it's take a mental health day or, you know, share with my team.

246
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,200
I need to reprioritize this because I just don't have time for it right now.

247
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,100
And so, I think it's all really connected.

248
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,600
Yeah, I am not sure you could tease it apart and then there're differences in mental health to write.

249
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,000
Is this a temporary thing?

250
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,900
Is, it's a chronic issue is a developing into a chronic issue.

251
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,500
So definitely a pieces of the same puzzle.

252
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,900
I think a lot of stress can lead to burnout.

253
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,700
I think mental health is that whole Spectrum?

254
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,400
Really of like, you are you taking care of it?

255
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,900
Is it to the point where it's chronic and maybe someone needs medication.

256
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,100
And how do we do stigmatize?

257
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,800
Some of that?

258
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,300
I love what you said about like he calling out when you need that time.

259
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,100
I have had people telling me.

260
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:15,800
Hey, can we move this meeting with my brains not here today, or I have had too many and I just can't and I won't be at my full capacity and doing it more like yeah, let us do that and making sure we're having kind of opening the space to have those kinds of conversations.

261
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,100
Say today is not a good headspace day.

262
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:19,900
Hmm.

263
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:32,000
I think the key right there to is how you as a manager, you're opening that up, like you're saying, it's okay to admit that, you know, giving the permission you also addressed the boundaries.

264
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,300
That's a question that came in.

265
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,300
How do I manage work versus personal boundaries?

266
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,600
Everything collides together in this remote, remote working world.

267
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,100
So how are you all managing that for yourselves?

268
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,800
And then how do you do it for your teams?

269
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,900
Will go right into that.

270
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,700
Teams.

271
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,100
Yeah, I will kick off a little bit on my side again.

272
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,600
Like, when I started I said I have this chunk of time.

273
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,700
Every single day for family, five days a week.

274
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,600
It doesn't move on Wednesdays.

275
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:19,100
I try to have no meetings, Wednesdays, obviously, sometimes that doesn't work and what we're having some teams experiment is at the team level is they get to select a no meeting day like within their teams, right?

276
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,900
So like in product, it might be Thursday, might be won.

277
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,500
For engineering and it's less about like being on 24/7 back-to-back.

278
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,800
One meeting to meetings to be meetings for meetings.

279
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:37,300
And then for me again going back to the 10 one's having those be walking talks have been phenomenal.

280
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,100
For me personally.

281
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,300
Now, I think going back to Brittany what you mentioned around?

282
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,600
The clear calendar bankruptcy.

283
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,400
I love that.

284
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,900
In fact, when we kicked off this court, I remember telling my staff.

285
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,200
Is a reevaluate.

286
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:04,900
All your meetings is quarter, like take a pause and kind of look at the calendar because the calendar ends up defining, everything we do whether we like it or not like that.

287
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,700
Invite is send.

288
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,300
There's people waiting for you on the other side of that Zoom link.

289
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,700
And if you're not taking inventory of whether this needs to be an actual call, can this be a phone call?

290
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,700
Can this just be an email or slack message?

291
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,400
Then?

292
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:26,300
Basically your lack of intentionality of checking in and In your time actually is going to pull you into a direction that you don't want to be in.

293
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:32,700
And so one things, I encourage my staff was to just re-evaluate that and I think what it does to.

294
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:41,200
It actually helps you not just create space for you and your team but it also helps you prioritize meetings actually matter.

295
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:50,900
If you take inventory of all your meetings, if you don't take inventory of your meetings, whether that's weekly monthly quarterly, then there's price and recurring meetings on there that don't need to be there.

296
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,500
And, so I go back to the calendar as this how I function every single day.

297
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:06,200
So the only way that I can operate is by making sure my calendar, reflects what I want, not necessarily what other people want as well.

298
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,600
That's great.

299
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,100
Roberto.

300
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,100
Any other thoughts?

301
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,900
Brittany make me, I was going to say, Roberto.

302
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,900
I feel like our calendars.

303
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:26,200
Probably look identical, because I do the same thing with icalendar blocks for family, time at night and blocks.

304
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,900
In the morning.

305
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,000
I think that overall, if anyone's booking over them, it's myself.

306
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,900
So I think having a visible calendar, we have transparent, calendars, attracts, people aren't going to go over those blocks.

307
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,300
When they see, you're taking Time for yourself.

308
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:53,000
I think the one thing that I would probably add is just in terms of, like, kind of the personal burnout when I have meetings back-to-back all day long, by the time I am signing off at night.

309
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,100
The last thing I want to do is talk to my husband or my family.

310
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:05,900
I am like, I have been talking all day long and it affects, you know, it if it's like, I want to end the day and spend that time with, you know, catching up on how your day was.

311
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:13,300
But sometimes when I realize I have so many at meetings, a it doesn't lead to a productive end of the day meeting.

312
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,200
So those last two meetings are really getting about 50% of me.

313
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:24,900
And then by the time I am signing off, it's really just not, I am not getting that personal time because I am so overwhelmed and thinking about, okay.

314
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,800
I had 10 meetings.

315
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,000
What do I need to action for each of those meetings?

316
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,600
And then I am probably working late into the night.

317
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:38,600
So I really try to manage my calendar and reorganize it as much as possible, which I would normally tell, you know, any new managers on my team.

318
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,800
I am like, Be consistent with your meetings, but you have to wear it.

319
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,800
We're working in such a different world now, so you have to reorganize things.

320
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Solid morning, ruthless need to prioritize, which we don't always do when I know I am people offices, especially hard because we're like, the empathy is so high and really all we want to get this done for people.

321
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,800
But you gotta sit down and say, no, this is where that line is.

322
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,400
Because if I am not gonna get my best, I won't be able to give you what you need.

323
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:03,900
Either.

324
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,200
The other thing.

325
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,100
I did want to call it.

326
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:13,100
Someone mentions the chat to is, if there isn't, you know, some people don't feel empowered to be able to have those conversations with their managers and that's true.

327
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:22,500
And I wish there was a really good solution for that if it doesn't come from the top down, And we as managers and leaders aren't displaying that, then it won't work.

328
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,100
And I mean it won't so that it won't work, but it won't be as effective.

329
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,300
Right?

330
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,100
I think as an individual, you can still try to do what you can.

331
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,800
But it definitely helps me have a support system and your team.

332
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,200
It's powerful.

333
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,900
I think I am seeing a lot of people resonating.

334
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,000
This is so real.

335
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:46,100
I have three children and you know II totally aligned to what you said, Brittany, right?

336
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,100
The other day after your, on all these calls.

337
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:55,100
It's like, I don't feel like talking, you know, so being able to prioritize scheduling.

338
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:00,300
I mean, how often do each of you manage your prioritization of your calendars?

339
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Day by day week by week.

340
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:11,600
It's unfortunately, I, so I try to do Sunday night check in and look at my week ahead.

341
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,700
That's when I typically check for.

342
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,000
And then every night, I check with the next day.

343
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,500
He's looking like, so then I can move things around if I need to.

344
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,300
But sometimes like today, I just move the meeting, just because I needed more space.

345
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,000
And I said, I see another slot on your calendar.

346
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,300
This time.

347
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,000
Does that work?

348
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,600
Okay, cool.

349
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,900
Well, I'ma go take a breather right now, or I am gonna go.

350
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,700
Have lunch with my kid as downstairs because I need that for me.

351
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,500
I do know, one thing as a new parent to.

352
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,300
I have one little girl.

353
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:50,900
She's two and a half going on 22 and I talk about this all the time like parenting and also being in a start-up is hard.

354
00:29:51,200 --> 00:30:01,900
But also for me, what it does is it forces me to unplug if you really are serious about that, if you say family time is family time, that time becomes rest.

355
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,500
But for me personally and it injects a different amount of energy, right?

356
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:18,900
Having a young kid that you can like nurture and play with and it's just a different world where I am going from like having an investor meeting to go in and clean blocks with your Barbies or whatever, whatever.

357
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,800
She's into that day.

358
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,200
PAW Patrol happens to be the thing.

359
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,000
She's into now.

360
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,100
So it's like this nice mix of things.

361
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,500
And, so I leaned into that really have the weight.

362
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:37,700
I lean into those moments and say, you know what, like yes, I have 30 I am gonna go grab that, and I am gonna go walk with the dog, or take a phone call instead.

363
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,000
And so, I do Sunday night for the week and then daily at night for the next day.

364
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,400
That's how I look at the calendars.

365
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,100
That's great.

366
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,900
Well, we got some questions that are going up voted.

367
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,000
So I am going to jump into this.

368
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I know we were in the category of management of burnout with your teams.

369
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,500
So, a couple questions related to that.

370
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,700
What are the burnout signs and triggers with team members that I should be aware of?

371
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,900
And I think we might have addressed some of this earlier.

372
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,500
Britney.

373
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,000
But is there, is there anything else you would?

374
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,500
You would add to that?

375
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,600
Yeah, I mean, I think I try to be really observant and remind myself and I say this to my team as well.

376
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,700
I am managing managers for the first time in my career.

377
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:31,900
So I am realizing that I am kind of playing back what I have learned in my experience and what I know of management a lot.

378
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:46,100
And I think some of just the obvious trigger signs are, you know, as someone eating lunch like we're very, were very aware of time zones, it breaks because we're remote company, but if someone eating lunch at 4:00 Is someone not taking PTO?

379
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,600
Time is someone sending emails after hours as someone have?

380
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,700
No again, we have transparent calendars.

381
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,100
So am I seeing someone's on back-to-back meetings?

382
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,300
And just kind of reminding yourself like we're not superhuman.

383
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,900
We cannot do this.

384
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:08,000
And I think, just by recognizing it with the team and letting them know, like, I will also say, like, I have to reschedule my calendar.

385
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,800
It's just too.

386
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,600
I have too much going on this week.

387
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It gives them kind of what Vicki was saying.

388
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,300
It lets them know it's okay.

389
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:21,400
Okay, so I think just really being observant of what's going on with your, your team and giving them an out.

390
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,100
Or sometimes.

391
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,200
I will just reschedule something.

392
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,500
I will say hey, sorry, calendars.

393
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,300
Crazy today.

394
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,500
I have nothing urgent for a one-on-one.

395
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,200
Let us move this to tomorrow if you want.

396
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,200
So, giving them that out.

397
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,300
I think really helps them feel a little relieved.

398
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,100
That's good.

399
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
That's really good.

400
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:54,800
The permission to you're giving permit, you're releasing permission, even by the language that you use with your team members and obviously, like modeling it as Leaders yourselves, is key for that accountability and behavior to manifest with your team members.

401
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,200
Are there any other points?

402
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Yeah, that is interesting because I was just having this conversation with Gina.

403
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,600
I am put us on the spot.

404
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:09,000
I think it was like last night and or like, one day this week and it was around.

405
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:18,000
It was around like, hey, I see that your notifications on or off and it's like these weird times that it comes on and off like your slack.

406
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,300
Like the green.is, the so interesting because we take that for granted, like when they green.is on, it means go.

407
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,300
Like in many ways.

408
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,800
It's like this person is available.

409
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,000
So go ahead and DM them.

410
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:42,100
Go ahead and go my slack versus controlling that even setting the boundaries even at that level and say, you know what, like I'ma put these boundaries in place, the tools have the capabilities for you to have Boundaries in place.

411
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:51,200
A lot of people don't even take advantage of that and I think as managers holding people to that holding people to, you know, time off at welcome.

412
00:33:51,200 --> 00:34:01,700
We like a lot of companies, you know, we, we have like the unlimited vacation policy and that's a double-edged sword because many people just don't take the vacations, right?

413
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:07,200
And so it means that we have to be more proactive around that, and we have some things in place that helps with that.

414
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:15,699
I am and, and I know we're getting to that Gina in a minute, but I think is having a pulse on the Small Things Brittany to what you're saying?

415
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,699
This person is responding after hours.

416
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,100
I haven't seen this person.

417
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,900
Take a vacation.

418
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,300
Can I look that up?

419
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,600
Have they not taking vacation level of energy?

420
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,500
I think is as well as a big is a big deal as well.

421
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:36,300
Like seeing their energy, you know this, you know your people well, you should know your people and when something is off and you feel like something's off.

422
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,900
Typically, it is off.

423
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,500
And so the question is, are you going to lean in and have the conversation?

424
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:51,000
I think that's something that I am learning every day as well as the leader in the fast-growing company is like those things matter and have them post when people really does matter.

425
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,900
Yeah, I think just add.

426
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:03,200
I think there's some very obvious signals that you can pick up on but then there's some of the not so obvious and that's where I think are.

427
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,300
We do a quarterly culture?

428
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,400
Survey that tells us so much about how our employees are feeling.

429
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,800
That's huge.

430
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:16,200
We also do I do 360 feedback, surveys with our teams with, with my directs.

431
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:29,700
I do them every six months which also tells us a lot of how they're doing and I think it gives them Overall, it gives them a really good idea of how their Partners think they're doing, and gives them some really great goals to work towards.

432
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,600
But just by that culture survey.

433
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,800
We monitor the trends.

434
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,700
We learn a lot from that, and we action a lot from that.

435
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,000
I have done these in the past and as an employee taking these, I have always liked, they don't read them.

436
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:52,200
But like being on the other side of it and like, we read every comment, and we literally make changes to policy and employee experience based on those comments.

437
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,200
Vicki, did you want to add anything?

438
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,500
Proud of have you +1 to everything that was said, yeah.

439
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,400
All right.

440
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Here's another question.

441
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,500
That's getting up.

442
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Voted pretty high.

443
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
What are low cost Solutions?

444
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,100
We can take to positively impact, our employees well-being.

445
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,700
I think that's a tough.

446
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,200
One.

447
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:35,300
One thing I would say is at least for me in my experience, educating myself on what burnout is similar like, really understanding it understanding what we can do to combat.

448
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,800
Some that's what are some, what are some of those therapy techniques.

449
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:47,300
What are some of those mindfulness techniques and then sharing that outright having discussions with your team, having discussions with the company talking about what this is talking about.

450
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,300
All of those things are University of Pennsylvania.

451
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,200
Did a study on resiliency.

452
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,200
So if you look up you can and the word Karma to erm a.

453
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:05,600
It they actually figured out all those pieces that kind of connect to what was really what creates resiliency, which is what helps with burnout.

454
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:05,900
Right?

455
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,300
And so there's like moments of positivity that can help with that.

456
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,000
So there's like a Magic Bullet.

457
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,300
I think this team kind of talked about how there wasn't one to fix burnout, but what are those little pieces that you can do?

458
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:27,200
Do to go and create more or build your resiliency, build your energy back up and really looking at those pieces to kind of help support some of that.

459
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:40,600
So that way, you know, it doesn't cost money to go and kind of do the research and share that back out and then maybe if you do have a budget, you can start finding other ways to build some of that in Yeah.

460
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,700
Yeah, Gina looks like we talked about like inexpensive ways.

461
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:52,300
I think that going back to the PTO thing and I see people having compliments inside of chat about the unlimited PTO and its controversial thing.

462
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,300
And you know for us we're in year 2 as a company.

463
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,800
Welcome, by the way, welcome is this platform that you guys are on today.

464
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,400
So welcome to welcome.

465
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:14,600
One of the things we were in year, two of our business of being in the market and what we It is look at your one and evaluating things, and we were asking what, what can we do better?

466
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:21,500
Right going back to the post surveys that we're getting from employees and asking the question, and we're startup, we were to like this young startup.

467
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,200
They were tripping over ourselves and we're running.

468
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:30,300
We're doing our best we can, and we tend to punch each other, you know, punch yourself in the face sometimes and Miss. opportunities.

469
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,400
When we saw it may be a glimmer of an opportunity that we should have taken.

470
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,600
And so we're constantly learning, right?

471
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:48,600
And one of the things we said, when we kicked off the show, Here we kicked off Wellness weekends, and it's a simple idea, but I think it has a high impact.

472
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,700
And what it means is that we are shutting down the first Friday of every month.

473
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,200
So we always have a three-day weekend.

474
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,600
So employees always have a three-day weekend, every single month.

475
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,500
Now when we do the calculations on that, as a business, that's almost like two weeks off.

476
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,000
That's 12 days a year.

477
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:26,100
That you have no option but to be off like we're forcing you to take 12 days off of year so that you can have a pause so that you have some intention around that three day weekend and sometimes, you know, the holiday kicks in, and they will be like a 40 weekend because a Monday is awful.

478
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,800
What have you?

479
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,700
But that's a small thing.

480
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,900
I think that we have been experimenting with this year.

481
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:41,000
And what would it helps with what it helps with as well, is when everybody is off, nobody's feeling like they have to be on.

482
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Quite a similar to some of the hard times have you taken off is because you're saying, you know what, we have to catch up so much.

483
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,600
It might take a week off.

484
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,100
Imagine.

485
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:59,300
All the emails have to catch up on those critical meetings that I want to be a part of when you shut down a company-wide, and we do it again.

486
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:07,000
One day a month that we focus on wellness, and we talked about how are you planning your Wellness weekend means that nobody else is on slide?

487
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,300
There is no other meeting happening.

488
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,700
You don't have to catch up because everybody's off.

489
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,500
And I think that's just an All way that.

490
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,900
And I think it's a cheap way actually because the Accord, the question was like, what's inexpensive ways.

491
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:27,300
I think is this is an inexpensive way to do that for you for your employees and something that we have been experimenting with and it's fun to see.

492
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,600
Yeah, we do a version of that.

493
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,000
We do two weeks, long breaks.

494
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:54,100
We do want it Fourth of July and when it Christmases and I think, what's most beneficial about it to your point is everyone just signing off the same time and then when you log back in after that 10 days because really from Friday that Monday, it's about 10 days off, you're signing on and you don't have an email inbox full that you have to catch up on.

495
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,100
You can actually enjoy the break and not think about what am I missing?

496
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,200
There're times when I have taken.

497
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,200
Off when no one else is taken off.

498
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
And I can't help but check slack, check email.

499
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,300
So I am a big fan of those, those brakes.

500
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,500
And we have we did the first one we did was right after covid.

501
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,700
And we were like, okay, people need to take some time, and we kept them because they have been so beneficial.

502
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,100
The other thing I would add is, you know, really, again, I think we're Berta.

503
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:37,300
We're very similar in terms of Zoom fatigue, as much as I can turn off cameras, taking walking meetings, thinking about When we can do a call and said seems to just really help people and sometimes it's like this can be 5 minutes.

504
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:42,200
We don't have a ton to catch up on just because it's a 30-minute meeting on your calendar, doesn't mean you need to use the whole time.

505
00:41:42,400 --> 00:42:11,800
So we're really big on sitting agendas and making sure I think I saw someone write in the chat, you know if you don't need to be there, feel free to decline the meeting, and we're not taking it personally, but I think also just being really intentional with your meetings and explaining why you have invited or what the context of the meeting is or what the goal of the meeting is, and then we have tried some other things at such as you know, employee LED self care, which I think just keeps the conversation going, whether it's meditation or workouts.

506
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,000
It's just letting people know that it's okay to do this during the day because we need to, and we need to focus on ourselves.

507
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:24,400
And that's actually, I don't think they always stick but I think it sends the right message and it really is appreciated.

508
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,800
So good.

509
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:29,800
All right.

510
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,900
I am going to jump into one of our highest voted questions goes into the company.

511
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,000
Topic category.

512
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:43,100
How do you prioritize employees mental health at a company level with limited time staff and other resources?

513
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:53,600
I think this the likes pulling similar threats of what we were just talking about, right?

514
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:59,000
I think that as Leaders it starts at the top down, so like for it's just us, right?

515
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,700
You're saying okay.

516
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,900
Can we afford to give everybody a force?

517
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,600
Can we shut the company down every Friday?

518
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,500
What does that look like?

519
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:21,400
So as the decision you have to make from the top down and then there's the when you think about empowering your employees, have the freedom to Have ownership about their mental health and preventing burnout.

520
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,000
I think that's probably the best thing we can do.

521
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:33,800
As Leaders is actually encouraging and holding folks accountable to take control of what they need because everybody needs something very different.

522
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,200
You know, I was a few weeks ago.

523
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,600
I had the pleasure of getting to know Arianna Huffington.

524
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:47,500
We were having a conversation, and she had this one question that I think for everybody as a manager here, I think for me, I wrote it down.

525
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:54,500
It's very simple, but I think it's very important and it was during the onboarding during the first 30 days.

526
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,800
Make sure you get time with your employee and ask them a simple question.

527
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,000
What is most important to you outside of work?

528
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,400
What is something that you're striving to do?

529
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:07,800
What's it?

530
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
What's a good life goal?

531
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,000
What's really important for you in this season?

532
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,300
And it sounds like a simple question.

533
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:21,700
But and then when you start to unpack that you start to realize as a manager, how do I hope that employee win on?

534
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,000
What's most important for them in this season?

535
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,900
What's a most important for her in the season?

536
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,300
So for example, an employee that lives in Tennessee?

537
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,400
She's remote.

538
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,500
She has a little girl, and she's involved in a sporting function.

539
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
She has to be at this time.

540
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,800
Every single Thursday is really important for her to be there.

541
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,500
It's like super important for her personally.

542
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:56,200
So now as a manager, you know, I am not going to book anything critical no meetings on that Thursday, because I don't want her to feel like she has to choose between that very important thing.

543
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,600
She has to go accomplish for her personally or being part of this meeting.

544
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:08,400
And so just having that self-awareness, as a leader, but also encouraging your employees to take full control of that and respecting that as well.

545
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,900
I think this is the way we scale this across with limited amount of resources.

546
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Sources, because all we have to do is Empower them to take ownership of it.

547
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:20,500
Is that the end of the day, you're only playing a part in their lives?

548
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:27,300
That's confound in this area, like, burnout and overwhelmed, like, seeps into every area.

549
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:27,600
Right?

550
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,800
And so, just understanding that better and empowering them to take control.

551
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,200
I think it's how we scale some of this with limited resources.

552
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,600
Empowerment is huge from the leadership and the other thoughts.

553
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,800
I think the other thing to ask is one, there is a cost to burn out.

554
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:53,500
I mean, mental health platforms, like Spring Health, Modern Health, they all have data around like, what the cost of it is.

555
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,200
We know there's a cost to turn over.

556
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,700
So there's actual like, monetary cost.

557
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,300
If you are having trouble kind of convincing, maybe leadership, there're dollars.

558
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,500
You can put behind it.

559
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:10,800
And then I think what we're gonna touch on like, the Letty, is something people are really craving and I think we have to ask ourselves.

560
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,900
You know, what can we change about the way we work?

561
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,800
That would help because I think in our heads we think are eight to five days a week.

562
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,200
That's how it's always been.

563
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,700
But does it have to be a why?

564
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,900
I think a lot of people, when we came into doing things virtually.

565
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,600
Oh, no, it's going to screw everything up.

566
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,900
Did not screw everything up.

567
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,100
We very clearly know how to, at least in most, I should say in all Industries.

568
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,000
Obviously, in some, it's very difficult to do that.

569
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:47,000
But in many is Actually possible, but we are so rigid in the way we think about how we sometimes operate that if we start there, really think about what problem are we trying to solve with helping people, and ensuring productivity?

570
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,400
Because there's this fear that if we don't do it to 5 Monday through Friday, right?

571
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:57,200
We're not going to be productive as a whole other topic in and of itself, but how do we then rethink how we do this?

572
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,500
Because maybe there's a better way to do it a different way to do it.

573
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,400
That would still get better results of someone's them more engaged.

574
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,800
Yeah, I think just to add to that.

575
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:13,100
The cost of not prioritizing it is detrimental to the business.

576
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:20,300
Think about how much time it takes to recruit and onboard and hire someone, and you have them for six months and you run them.

577
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,700
So dry that they're burnt out by the end of they leave.

578
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,700
You have to start that process all over again.

579
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:34,900
It's it really, I think it's super beneficial to have just an open dialogue about burnout and mental health and, and work-life balance.

580
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,900
And all of the above.

581
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,800
From day one and being able to offer those resources to your company and let them know your stance on it.

582
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:47,600
I think is so incredibly important and I think hearing from it top down which I think we have said a few times.

583
00:47:47,600 --> 00:48:01,500
Now are one of our co-founders, Pedro wrote a whole blog post on mental health and really just opened up to the company and it really showed just a vulnerable side of a Founder that you typically don't see.

584
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,500
And it made everyone feel like it's okay to have days that you're high.

585
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:11,600
You have highs and lows and it just really allowed people to relate to him and really just understand his stance.

586
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,600
So it was, I think really empowering.

587
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,600
That's great.

588
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,400
This company level support comes up.

589
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,300
I have another high vote on it.

590
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,000
I think we did answer a lot of it.

591
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,400
This question is very similar, are there policies that can be put in place at a company level.

592
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:38,000
And, so I think all of you have shared something about that, which I think is really it starts from the top and talking.

593
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:46,500
I am hearing empowerment of your employees and really creating that culture and environment where it's safe to be able to be vulnerable.

594
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,500
And be real.

595
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,500
So I think those are all powerful things.

596
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,600
Here's another question from Alexandria.

597
00:48:52,800 --> 00:49:01,600
How do you encourage people to prioritize treating their burnout when it feels like another task on their already unmanageable to-do list?

598
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:16,800
This actually came up and whenever meetings one of our team members left and the manager inherited the calendar, and they saw kind of what was on it.

599
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,500
So you like oh, I could have done a better job here.

600
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,500
It may be going through and helping them figure out what to prioritize.

601
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,500
How to think about it.

602
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,500
Another thing I have done with our people managers at least and I think it's a good exercise to kind of do in groups.

603
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,700
Is to really just sit down and ask each other.

604
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,600
How do we, what can we get?

605
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,800
Up, like our marketing team has sat down and done that before.

606
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,200
Like what do we stop doing?

607
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,400
And really when we say stop doing is not kind of sort of keep doing it.

608
00:49:45,400 --> 00:50:02,400
It's actually really stop doing it because we all agree that there's like too much right now, and we have to prioritize stuff and even just sitting down with someone else, because when you're in it, you're kind of too close to it and having an external person, come and look at what's going on, that kind of knows what your work is.

609
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,100
And they can say, hey, do you actually need to do that?

610
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,400
Or does that one really matter?

611
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,600
What's that one for?

612
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,800
Or and it might help to get that kind of separate View.

613
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,300
Yeah, I will follow on that Vicki.

614
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:15,800
I think.

615
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:21,900
Yeah, like the ideal focus, and we take that for granted for we just focus on the right things.

616
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:32,900
But actually there's probably 30 40 percent of the things that you're working on that can be optimized and or removed.

617
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:43,000
And you can focus that other 40% of energy on the other 60 and supercharged that for yourself for the business and for the results, but sometimes it's hard to say, no, and let go of things.

618
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,600
But in the reality is, I am a double down on things that are working.

619
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:53,300
And when they were down to things that have traction, given my limited T, my resources, I am gonna say no to a lot of things.

620
00:50:53,300 --> 00:51:05,600
So I can say yes, the right things and I just freeze up a lot of head space because now, you start your week, you know, these are the only three things I care about and these are the things that my manager cares about and what's going to get us results.

621
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,600
And then a super important, especially for start-up that you tend to just wear.

622
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:21,200
So many hats is being able to prioritize The things that actually matter one thing that I want to Anchor back to I think somebody talked about ending meetings early.

623
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:21,900
I love that.

624
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,100
I love the idea of ending meetings early like just because it's 30 minutes.

625
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:25,800
It doesn't need to be.

626
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:37,100
I remember when I was at Google we had these meetings that They were always like an hour meeting was to be 50 meetings and 30 minute meetings will always be 25-minute meetings.

627
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,200
And I remember being new employee at go on our side.

628
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,000
You know, what is because we have to walk from this building that this building.

629
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,200
I got to get on that silly Google bike and go from one building to the other building.

630
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,600
So they want like that buffer time, but we still need that buffer time.

631
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,900
Even now, even at the zoom level of connecting to another room.

632
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,800
Another meeting.

633
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,000
And so, in your Google calendar, if you go to your Google calendar, there are a settings.

634
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,100
And, in fact, Go ahead and drop the image inside of chat.

635
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,000
There's a setting that you can enable.

636
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,500
So every time you book a meeting, it always defaults to fight.

637
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:17,600
Give you a five or ten minute buffer to every meeting you said, and that's and then it takes your discipline to be able to cut it off at that point.

638
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,800
But at least you set it up and say, that's the time, we're going to be meeting with me.

639
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,600
Five minutes, Gap or 10 minutes in between.

640
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:28,200
All right.

641
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,400
I am going to go through these unless.

642
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,300
Did you have Brittany?

643
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,200
Another note on that?

644
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,100
Okay, I have got nine minutes left.

645
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:36,500
So I am going to try to get through as many questions as we can here.

646
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,300
This is more specific to sales roles.

647
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,100
How do you encourage reps to take time off?

648
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,000
Especially since quota is a large part of the Roll.

649
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,000
Tricky balance.

650
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,600
That's a tricky one.

651
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,000
Yeah, I think especially in sales.

652
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:05,500
This is a very tricky one because it's your like every day that I am off is actually hurting my performance quote unquote, right?

653
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:21,000
Because I am putting numbers on the board and I think it comes down to just Being able to manage a book of business in a way I think about, I think about sales folks as entrepreneurs is like they're running their own business, right?

654
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,800
So you could you have the advantage of running your own business?

655
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:39,000
You can say, you know what I am going to use Monday through Thursday to hammer this home in Friday's, you know, I am going to take, I am gonna do half days on Friday, and I am actually going to go to a coffee shop and do this, but it's around owning your book of business in a way that as an entrepreneur, you can think about it.

656
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,100
And say, you know what, like I get to own my business.

657
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,300
And I am a run it this kind of way.

658
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,200
So maybe Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday are going to be like this.

659
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,000
Maybe Mondays are going to be like this in Friday is going to be like that.

660
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,900
I think you do have that Advantage.

661
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:07,800
If again, if you take the owners ownership mentality, it's, you know, one of our core values on at welcome is simply own it, and it talks about like, taking full ownership of it, no matter how big or how small, and I think applying that to your time and how you work.

662
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:13,300
I think in the sales and sales case can be very fruitful as well.

663
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,200
I think one thing that we do it, Brax is we enforce decompression days.

664
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:26,400
So, we will tell people take the day off after 12 or take the full day off.

665
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,200
Sometimes, we will say, spend $50 on your brakes card or a hundred dollars in a bricks card, and go do something to decompress.

666
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:37,700
And I think again, it just gives them that like we're giving that permission and pushing you guys.

667
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:47,700
And then we also share in our slack channels of, you know, tell us what you did today and I think it just kind of lets people be a little more comfortable taking that and now, That everyone else is taking it too.

668
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,100
It's great.

669
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:52,500
Britney.

670
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,600
Looks like we have another question.

671
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,500
Actually for you.

672
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,900
How do you suggest dealing with imposter syndrome and overcoming those negative effects?

673
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,400
That's a great question.

674
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:12,300
It's, I think it's something that You just have to shove to the back of your mind because it's really hard.

675
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,300
And at the end of the day, you have to remind yourself.

676
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,500
It's so much of your, it's so much of you doing it.

677
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,400
And what I am really, I am huge on self-reflection.

678
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:27,600
So at the end of every quarter, I have written down accomplishments and improvements and things that I want to work on.

679
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,600
But I also don't set the bar too high.

680
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:38,500
I am not expecting 20, huge accomplishments and I do this with my team to wear even if we look at daily goals when we're Prioritizing weekly goals.

681
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,400
Most days, I will just set if I can accomplish these three things today.

682
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,500
I have had a good day.

683
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:50,200
And then when I reflected, I write this all down on a notepad so that I can look back week to week at the end of each quarter.

684
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:55,500
It's a nice reminder that I am not doing as bad as the little voice in my head is telling me I am doing.

685
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,800
I am not even close to it.

686
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:10,300
And I think also between that and performance review is just, you know, I think it really is in your head so much, but I am really huge on documentation and being able to look back at things and it's just a nice reminder.

687
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:15,800
And then the one other thing is I have a happy days filter of every time I get praise or recognition.

688
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,200
I save it in my email and I go back and look at that and I it's just again a nice reminder that.

689
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,500
I am in my own head, and I am doing good work and it really helps.

690
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,600
So good.

691
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,800
I think I want to start that happy praise folder.

692
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,000
I have seen Pope affirmation, Post-it notes as an exercise as well.

693
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,900
Put that on your wall.

694
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,200
Vicky any added thoughts.

695
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,800
I would say also, you make sure you have a good support network around you.

696
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,600
I think similar to Britney's point.

697
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,300
It's in our head and for sitting in our head alone that's even worse.

698
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,500
Right?

699
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:58,900
But when you have other people who remind you of the things that you're really good at that can be really powerful.

700
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,200
I like how Jeff mention the bonus baby doll.

701
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
Go back and look through my own boat asleep.

702
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,600
Eat if I am having a crappy day because it does remind me like, oh, yeah.

703
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:17,900
I did all these things and you know, our brain naturally, we will go to the — so you need to yank it out of there because our threat response is Hi to just sit in the positive for a bit and really think about.

704
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,400
Okay.

705
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,600
What am I really proud of another thing that my team does is every month.

706
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,900
We have a highlights and learnings slide that I have everyone fill out.

707
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:32,400
So we talked about the things that we were really proud of and the things that we learned, so we're constantly one, it's to help.

708
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,100
Make sure that we're talking about the mistakes we made.

709
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,000
And what we learn from them to is like, hey, what were you really proud of?

710
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,300
So that you remember that you did something great because my type performance review comes around, sometimes you're like, I don't even remember what I did last month.

711
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,800
By the way, I will jump in and say at welcome bonus, Lee feed is the most lit feed.

712
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,200
Welcome, and it's so good because you see it's like, it's like the Love Fest.

713
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,000
Everybody's like, hey, this person is awesome.

714
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,400
This person.

715
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:57,500
No.

716
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,300
No, you're awesome.

717
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:04,300
Is like, I would love seeing and I think it's interesting because I think it's correlated in helping burnout as well.

718
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,300
Because one of the reasons for a burnout was in a symptom of it.

719
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:12,400
It's feeling like you're not recognized enough and I think small things like a bonus.

720
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Lee recognition can go a long.

721
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,600
Way, I think for folks.

722
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,300
All right.

723
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,900
I don't know if we could fit two questions because there's some a couple of really good questions.

724
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,300
But here's one.

725
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,300
How do you signal burnout to your boss?

726
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:32,800
When everyone around, you seem to be doing just fine with the same or even more work?

727
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,700
I think the best advice I received early in my career was don't compare your beginning to someone else's middle.

728
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,500
And you have to remember, we're all starting at different times.

729
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,700
And I am also just the I have over the years.

730
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,100
I was always like how I want to be, I want to always be positive for my boss.

731
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,500
I always want to show up for my boss.

732
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,600
But again, we're human, and we're going to have bad days and I find that just having that level of transparency with my boss.

733
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:08,200
He will actually recognize when I am having an off day and I think Just really helps to just be really open.

734
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:21,200
You have also at least I talk to my colleagues sometimes and I think we make assumptions because everyone's kind of put on their work face when they're at work or you know, especially if you're a leader, right?

735
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:32,400
Because you bring the weather so it may not be actually true that they're doing the same or even more work and it'd be a good way to if you can is you feel safe enough to gut check that too.

736
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,900
And said, maybe actually find out, you're all kind of in the same boat and then that's even easier to go and bring to a leader.

737
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,200
It's great.

738
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,000
All right one last question.

739
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,600
I am pulling up Spencer's question here?

740
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,300
I don't know if you all see it.

741
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:53,200
It says now that I have been remote for two plus years having zero decompression time between work and family.

742
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:58,000
I hate traffic, but that who I just lost it.

743
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,100
There it is.

744
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,600
Okay, I hate traffic, but that was my deep compression time.

745
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,500
How are you solving that for yourself and your employees?

746
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,600
That's a real one.

747
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,700
I hate you.

748
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,100
I really wanted percent.

749
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,800
I hate traffic, but I was into, I love driving.

750
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,100
Actually, it's a form.

751
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:25,600
Driving is a form of self care, for me, like sometimes when I need some space, just going for a drive actually helps.

752
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:36,400
And my wife knows that is when I get to actually turn up the music and Feel the Bass without like freaking everybody out in the house with like the music I listened to or any of that.

753
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,800
I think it's my time.

754
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,500
And, so I don't know what the solution is.

755
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:49,700
On this, especially in, this remote World outside of self-awareness, and knowing what you need, because you get to manage that time.

756
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:55,000
And for me, it starts and stops at the calendar level, like me being able to block off.

757
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:06,600
Even before I start my day, being able to block off that buffer time of transition, whether that's a work out, whether that's a walk, whether that's putting my little girl down for a nap, right?

758
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,500
So yeah, I don't have the answers Spencer, but I miss those days.

759
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,400
Days of filling the base with music as well.

760
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,500
Love it, and I see Vicky.

761
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,100
You take short walks for your decompression time, Brittany.

762
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,000
What do you do for decompressing?

763
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,300
Oh, you're a mute.

764
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:33,800
Sorry, I made it the whole time without doing that and, you know, with one minute to go.

765
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,400
But yeah, big on going for walks with my dog.

766
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:46,100
I think just spending time with my dog, in general gives me like so much joy, so as much as I can get outside to decompress with her, it really helps love it.

767
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,000
Wow.

768
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:47,200
