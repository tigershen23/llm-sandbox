1
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,600
Did a full 180 crazy?

2
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,600
Don't come out.

3
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,900
Anything could stop me.

4
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,300
Hi everyone.

5
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,400
Happy Wednesday, it's great to be here.

6
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,700
It's great to see some of you trickling, in feel free to drop in what city you're tuning in from.

7
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:35,800
I am here in Ewa Beach, Hawaii, and this is about 30 minutes away from Honolulu in Oahu.

8
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,500
Can't complain about the weather right now.

9
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,300
It is, it is chillier.

10
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,200
But, you know, it's still probably around high 60s or so.

11
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,700
So, anyway, I am so excited today.

12
00:06:48,700 --> 00:07:01,900
We have got Alex Kelly director of digital marketing at serous joining us today, and we're going to be talking about attention-grabbing B2B Marketing in a very noisy Market.

13
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:13,600
There's a lot of efficiencies and different things that marketers are thinking about, as we're moving into 2023 and things, got to change the way that we Market.

14
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:21,600
The way that we work the way that we Singe and meet our buyers, across the buying Journey need to change.

15
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,900
And So within the constraints of 2023, it breeds creativity.

16
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:38,000
And I think this is the opportunity where we can hear from Alex on some of the Innovative approaches and ways in which he is able to Foster creativity and thinking with his team's.

17
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,200
So with that, I would love to invite Alex to the stage.

18
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,100
Please join me.

19
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,500
Hello, thank you.

20
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,500
Hello.

21
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,000
Thanks so much.

22
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,800
For having me.

23
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I am doing well.

24
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,500
It's been a pretty slow roll to the week, but excited to kick things up in the middle here.

25
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,900
Nice.

26
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,300
Nice.

27
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,500
Right.

28
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,200
Right before the holidays.

29
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,500
So, right, before everything just shuts down again.

30
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,100
Exactly.

31
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,600
Yeah.

32
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,200
Thanks for even just showing up really, really appreciate it.

33
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,900
And I am really excited about the conversation that we're going to dive into today.

34
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:31,400
But before we jump in, there's a few fun facts that I would love to jump right into And you know, all I will start with my fun fact, and then we will go into yours but I have got a different way of getting your fun facts notified.

35
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,900
So this is Allyson Felix and I basically played basketball with her.

36
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:50,400
We went to the same high school and it was funny because like, she literally could not make any basketball shot, like it would go straight off the backboard, but she was the fastest one down on each side.

37
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,300
I would have offense and defense to the end of the court.

38
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,300
So that's my fun fact for you.

39
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:04,100
Alex, we got some fun facts and you're a musician.

40
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:16,400
I am yes I study music in college and then I thought that's what I was going to do with my life and then you know, decided maybe I wasn't a hundred percent cut out for that life.

41
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:23,400
And when I moved back to New Jersey, I sort of fell into what I am doing now, which is very different but kind of similar in some ways.

42
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,300
Nice, nice.

43
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,800
And I know we were hoping to get a life singing session, but maybe another time.

44
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,200
Yeah, it wasn't quite feeling up to it after the last week and a half that I have had but I would have loved it all good.

45
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,900
All good.

46
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,300
Okay, so I have got another fun fact, sort of poll that we can do here.

47
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:51,400
It's called to it's will be three truths and One Lie and if we could pull that up on stage.

48
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,300
So there're these facts which some of these you just mentioned that are true about you?

49
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:07,000
But if you all want to vote, which one is not true about Alex, Go ahead and drop your votes.

50
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,700
Majored in music in college takes on graphic design.

51
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,100
Gig has twin boys, just got married.

52
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,400
So go ahead and drop in your votes.

53
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:26,200
This is where the Jeopardy music comes in doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

54
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,300
Okay.

55
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,300
All right, we got votes so just got married.

56
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,000
What's not true?

57
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,500
Alex.

58
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,300
I definitely do not take on graphic design gigs.

59
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,700
Nobody wants to pay me for that.

60
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,000
That would be, that would be an Abomination.

61
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,400
We're kind of playing.

62
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,700
We're splitting hairs here.

63
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:52,100
I got we had our wedding on Saturday, but it was after several covid.

64
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,500
Delays.

65
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,000
We were supposed to get married back in March of 2020, right?

66
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,200
When the world shut down, and we pushed it one year, which ended up not being nearly long enough.

67
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,800
So we ended up having to delay it.

68
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:10,000
It once again, and we decided to do it in December of this year.

69
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,400
So we legally got married in 2021 but it was very small thing and only our parents are there.

70
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:23,600
And so we finally had our wedding this Saturday, which is also why I am feeling not quite up to destroying my vocal cords.

71
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,200
Even more from all the singing and dancing we were doing.

72
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,200
Wow.

73
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,600
Congratulations.

74
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,200
Thank you.

75
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
What a big deal?

76
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,700
Yeah, and the we do have twin boys.

77
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:41,100
We have identical twins who are one-year olds, and they were able to come for a little bit.

78
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,500
So they we they got pushed down the aisle by our nephew which was definitely a highlight for both of us.

79
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,400
Well, I hope you get a ton of rest and recovery coming out of that.

80
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,400
Thank you.

81
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,500
Yeah.

82
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,600
So let us Jump Right In to know you even more.

83
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,500
I would love to dive into your story.

84
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Getting into B2B marketing.

85
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,400
And you know why, why beaten we have marketing wide Tech.

86
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,400
You probably could have gone to the b2c direction but walk us through your journey and how you got to serous.

87
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
Yeah, well everybody grows up.

88
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:27,700
Definitely wanted to be a B2B marketer when they're a child, they dream about it right now.

89
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,600
I studied music in college.

90
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:45,300
I thought that's the route that I wanted to go is The only thing I was really all that passionate about and spending a lot of my time, just performing and writing and doing all the things that I just found a lot of joy in and creatively and in school and all throughout college.

91
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,300
And when I graduated in started writing more and thought, that's what I wanted to go.

92
00:12:51,300 --> 00:13:05,200
I was still living down in Virginia and I kind of hit this point where I was either going to move to Nashville and really make that a concerted effort or I would already been From home in New Jersey for seven or so years.

93
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:13,700
A few years after college and I kind of wanted to go back for a bit and just see everybody that I had grown up with that, that was back in the area and my family was nearby.

94
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:26,000
And so when I, when I came back, I kind of fell into working with a really close friend of mine, doing some project management work at a mortgage company and it was a lot of requirements Gathering.

95
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,800
It was helping to organize their projects and keep them on task and just kind of help out wherever I could.

96
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,500
And some of the things that we ended up taking on.

97
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,700
We're very much in the digital marketing realm.

98
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,600
It was you know we were helping to build this new retail forward website.

99
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,800
They had Marketo install, but nobody really knew how to administrate it or use it.

100
00:13:48,800 --> 00:14:01,500
So I just kept raising my hand and saying, yeah, sure, I will try to teach myself how to do this, or we just got more involved in some of these kinds of projects because we were fairly fresh out of college and willing to take on some of these more.

101
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,200
Tech, heavy task and I really just enjoyed it.

102
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,700
I liked it, the things I was I was taking on I liked the challenge of it.

103
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:26,500
It was, it was also really fun to just try to learn as much as I could and teach myself what I needed to know, to do the job on the day, and it was a lot of, you know, reading Hub, spots blog and all that kind of stuff and just trying to learn as much as I because I never took any marketing courses and in college.

104
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:36,300
And, you know, after a few years there and you know, through that time I was given the opportunity to take on more direct ownership over these things.

105
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,800
I hired some folks and got to learn from a couple of others who are in the marketing realm.

106
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:50,000
And I really wanted to try to make that my core focus and moved over to working at an agency for a time.

107
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:01,500
It was a hotspot partner, inbound marketing agency and great way to learn a lot really fast working with a ton of different types of clients, but it was not exactly for me that kind of model.

108
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Where you're, you know, a team of one or two taking on eight or nine, clients in all these different Industries and doing everything for them, including all the account management and the strategy and the content creation, and the implementation and all that stuff.

109
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:22,200
So I after that, I was lucky enough to get connected with the team of data dog.

110
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:39,600
And, you know, I joined the demand generation team there which was just a really phenomenal sort of solidification of My understanding of B2B marketing and how a business like that can run and how a marketing team at a business like that can run.

111
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:48,600
And, you know, I worked with a team of really awesome marketers across all the different teams that we're supporting that business.

112
00:15:48,600 --> 00:16:03,700
And it was just a really, really awesome experience being there at the time that I was there and that was, you know, somewhere around the range of 250 to 600 plus employees and it Just under a year and a half that I was there.

113
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,800
So it was rapid growth.

114
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,300
There was a lot of success.

115
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,400
It was, it was just really fascinating to see how they ran.

116
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:29,100
And I kind of found myself missing a little bit of that chaos from the agency days when I was just getting my hands on everything and trying things out and seeing what worked, and I got introduced to the VP of marketing at serous through somebody that I had worked with and at data dog.

117
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:38,600
And, and just really liked what he had to say, and they were a smaller, team, smaller organization, really high appetite for experimentation.

118
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:47,300
And how the product is there were just over 100 maybe just a hair over 100 people, and they were not all in New York.

119
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,800
It was, you know, the entire product organization was remote.

120
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:56,100
There was a handful of people starting to start an in the UK and the rest of us were in New York City.

121
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:04,700
Office wasn't even nearly 100 people, so it felt a lot smaller and it felt Very contained in that way.

122
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,000
And I really liked that and then marketing team was pretty small.

123
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,500
We were with the VP maybe you know, five people or so.

124
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,200
And then we had an editorial team that was maybe three or four or think at the time.

125
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,099
And so there was just a lot of going on.

126
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:33,500
You're trying to figure a lot of things out and I like that energy about it and it was also just the last four and a half years that I have been here, just been a great learning experience and really great growing.

127
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,100
You know, experience to opportunity to grow and stretch myself and a bunch of different ways.

128
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:53,600
And, you know, now we're a little over 400 employees and, you know, a lot more people in the UK and now we're fully distributed and a global team which is just really, really interesting Evolutions over that time.

129
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:03,000
But yeah, not exactly what I thought it was going to do, but I have loved the, the Journey of it's been really, really fascinating plus I still The do creative things, but I love.

130
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,900
Hmm.

131
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,300
So tell us about what you do at serous.

132
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,500
Yeah.

133
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:21,100
So I head up the digital Bob bit of a misnomer, but I am the director of digital marketing, which started as purely taking ownership, over the digital team, which, you know, we had events and digital, which is kind of everything non-event.

134
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:37,800
And right now, I had up a team or help manage a team of around 10 marketers that is everything from digital, which is are always on digital programming or growth engine for inbounds coming in through the website.

135
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,000
It's email marketing and have an inbound SDR.

136
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:53,700
That's a part of that team, but we also that the team is also making up a demand generation more campaign, specific or account-based efforts to help support particular verticals.

137
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,900
I now lead our field marketing team, which is our event strategy across book, North America, and a Mia.

138
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,400
As well as customer marketing.

139
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:11,900
So all of our sort of enablement and dissemination of engaging content and materials for our existing customers as well.

140
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,000
So it's a bit broader than it started.

141
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:31,400
It's quite a bit broader than it started but it's, you know, it's kind of grown organically over that time, and we try to make it feel really cohesive as much as we can and really tie these different areas of the team together to make sure that we're all sort of capitalizing on what we're able to.

142
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:38,800
To do in tandem with each other not just individually as separate groups, how is your current marketing team structured?

143
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,300
So I helped oversee that, that part of the organization, which is those marketing functions.

144
00:19:45,300 --> 00:20:00,400
The more I would say campaign or Channel specific execution arms, digital demand generation field marketing and customer marketing as well as a web developer that helps oversee our various marketing web properties.

145
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,900
And then Of in parallel to us.

146
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:10,500
Next to us our VP of content oversees, all of the content and editorial social and design and creative resources.

147
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:22,500
So we partner really closely with that part of the team, and we are very dependent on them for a lot of the creative decisions and execution to help facilitate the programs that we're trying to run.

148
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:31,000
But I tend to focus mostly or at least I hope much heavier on the new business growth of the organization.

149
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,600
And a lot of the programs to help support that growth.

150
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,900
Wow, that's a lot of responsibility on your side.

151
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,200
It's been fun.

152
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:52,400
It's certainly been challenging especially over the last few years but the challenge has been you know really rewarding part A lot has changed over the last, you know, three or so.

153
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,500
Years going remote, you know, pretty much the entirety of the team.

154
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,300
One person on the team today on my side of the team today was here.

155
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,700
In the office with us everything.

156
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:10,200
Everyone else has been brought into the team since which is just sort of fascinating change to see.

157
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:16,500
But yeah, it's been, it's been a lot of stretching myself.

158
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:25,500
A lot of trying to learn and trying to learn as much as I can and take on some of these bigger challenges but that's what also keeps it really interesting.

159
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,600
That's awesome.

160
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:34,900
Well, jumping into the topic today, of attention-grabbing B2B marketing.

161
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,600
How are you thinking about this?

162
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,300
Especially going into 2023?

163
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,200
This is going to be more important than ever.

164
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,900
At the same time we don't want to just be noise, right?

165
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:57,800
As marketers, how can we create meaning and really that differentiated unique type of messaging, So what are your thoughts?

166
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
You know, in this topic going into 2023?

167
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Yeah, it's it is a challenge for everybody.

168
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,600
It's challenge for every Organization no matter what you're selling, what your who your customer is.

169
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:20,500
We as consumers are inundated with countless messages and marketing campaigns.

170
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,700
And, you know, just information overload across every channel.

171
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:25,900
Not even.

172
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,300
At, but our expectations have changed dramatically as consumers.

173
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,900
It's not even just the noise.

174
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:38,800
It's also, you know, we consume information and media so (differently) than we were even a handful of years ago in some of these cases.

175
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:55,900
But if you look at what Netflix and the streaming model is done for our consumption of media, if you look at how organizations are trying to adapt to that, you know, you can look at the changing landscape of how, you know, entertainment and movies are created and distributed it.

176
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:10,500
Its it is monumentally different from the experiences that we sought out as consumers, you know in the Years prior and our expectations of how we consume information and find information has changed.

177
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:17,300
Because of that we expect a very similar type of experience and delivery model from the businesses that were looking to consume from.

178
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:26,400
You know, as marketers, we create a lot of content, we are creating a lot of information, and we are looking to distribute that across all the Channels.

179
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,500
And we're always trying to find the ones that are connecting with our audience or where our audience is engaging.

180
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:54,600
But that landscape changes really rapidly and the I guess we look back you know, since the early 2000s that inbound marketing model of sort of owned media and these creating these platforms have content awareness and distribution where your you will create gated content offers.

181
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:03,000
And you will surround that with blog, Posts and you will rank for specific keywords and you will bring in this organic traffic and grow some more sustainably over time.

182
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:15,000
There's a lot of really good ideas in that are just a lot more challenging today because of the changing algorithms of what actually ranks and what Google is going to reward over other content.

183
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,500
It also is challenging because every organization is following the same Playbook.

184
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:29,500
We're all trying to do the same kinds of things, which means we're all creating the same articles for the same words in the same phrases, and We're always trying to outrank each other for that same traffic.

185
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,100
But Google is also sending less traffic back to your website.

186
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:42,100
Then they were in years prior because they want people to remain in their platform and every social media, platform acts, the same way, they're prioritizing the things that keep them there.

187
00:24:42,100 --> 00:25:00,600
Because that eyeball in, that platform, is more valuable to them than some of the ad dollars or whatever the case is that you're creating for your audience, they don't, they don't want to prioritize your value, they want to prioritize their own, so they will charge you for the same amount of awareness and an activity than they otherwise would have organically.

188
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:11,600
So all of these things are making it a lot harder to not just get the attention of your audience but to deliver information in a way that they actually care about and that they actually want to consume and interact with.

189
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:39,300
So what we have spent a lot of time, you know, doing and really it's very important parcel with what our platform kind of does, and we try to eat our own dog food as much as we can, which is We create content that we find incredibly interesting and, and more eye-catching and interactive, and then we find ways of refactoring that for whatever that Channel or the median is.

190
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,000
Because at the end of the day, your product message can be really compelling.

191
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,000
But if you don't have the eyeballs of that audience, they're never going to get there.

192
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,300
They're never going to find it.

193
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,900
So you need to get their attention first.

194
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,100
And then, you could start to translate that into ways of really understanding what your product, and what your ultimate.

195
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,500
You is to them as a consumer but it's really an attention economy at the moment.

196
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,100
And we're really just trying to figure out.

197
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:11,600
How do we, how do we combat the competition, which is not just the people that we compete with, on a product basis?

198
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:19,700
It is competition in the forms of people would rather spend their time scrolling through social media, then engaging with your business.

199
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,500
How do you play in that space?

200
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,000
They'd rather be looking at videos that are entertaining.

201
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,700
I am versus videos that might be relevant to what your product offers.

202
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:37,500
So how do you make your product messaging more entertaining and more like the things that they actually want to seek out all?

203
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:45,900
These things are sort of converging into this very difficult space of his digital competition.

204
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:56,400
So some of the things that we're trying to do our take our editorial Direction, and we have been doing this for quite some time, in the team is creating some really interesting.

205
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,800
Arresting interesting stuff, but our editorial direction is much broader.

206
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,000
It's not fully rooted in our buyer.

207
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,400
It's not fully rooted in our product.

208
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:13,200
It is just interesting stories told visually and through interactive lenses that is also sort of passive showcase for what our product can do.

209
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:34,500
So if they find that interest, and we're able to connect that interest it with the Right audience, then there're ways of us, re-engaging them with things that are more and more relevant to the business and the product further On the cycle, but we're always trying to lead with that eye-catching moment, that interactive element, that just gets them to lean in just a little bit.

210
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,000
Even though it's through a, through a screen in a digital channel, thank you.

211
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:50,300
I think you explained the landscape really well and the challenges of a very noisy attention-grabbing type of landscape that we have to deal with today.

212
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,200
What process are you working with your team to get to that?

213
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,600
Type of messaging that's differentiated and meaningful entertaining.

214
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:11,300
You know, I don't think the mechanisms there are two dissimilars What is ultimately necessary?

215
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:20,700
In all cases is to understand the customer and understand what they care about and what they're interested in, as it relates to their role.

216
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:27,300
But also expanding that lends to what they just find interest in and what they engage with in there, they're sort of day-to-day lives.

217
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:34,700
You know, the, the feedback loop sort of insight Gathering process is very much.

218
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,000
Still, a research based effort, it's having conversations with people.

219
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,800
Trying to observe them in their natural habitat, it's just taking conversations in a more natural Direction versus it being purely.

220
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,300
Well, how would you solve this problem and what do you feel when you experience that problem?

221
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,200
And it's not 100% around?

222
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
What is your product?

223
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,300
How to understand?

224
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,800
How your product can solve for a problem?

225
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,000
It's also just, you know, what are you interested in?

226
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,100
What are you seeing today?

227
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,100
That is really catching your eye.

228
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,700
What do you where do you go for information?

229
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,000
Where do you turn to that?

230
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:16,300
You trust who Are the people that you really perk up when they're speaking about a topic that's related to the things that you care about.

231
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:24,600
And if you can kind of converge, those topics of Interest with the people of influence and the channels of connectivity.

232
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,700
That's really where the magic happens but you really can't get there.

233
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:43,200
Unless you're either having direct conversations or trying to, you know, find that research out and more mass-market ways of either existing research or conducting your own Roan on a more broad basis but it's got to come from your audience.

234
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:55,700
Otherwise, you're going to be led astray by the time, the tactics and strategies that got us to where we are today which is not going to get us through the next, you know, three five ten years as the landscape continues to evolve and change.

235
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:03,900
So we were to get a little more tactical on how you go about to gather the research and the insights.

236
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:12,500
Are you regularly doing customer interviews, or what are ways in which you are able to get those insights?

237
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:22,000
Yeah, couple of ways either direct conversations were its it is sort of structured more than a fact-finding mission.

238
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,700
We are, we want to speak with, you just about your behaviors, and we want to understand what makes you tick.

239
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:45,500
We want to understand, you know what you do in your day-to-day, both inside work and out and how we can use that to start a triangulate as we interview more, more people, you can also create content anchors that help to capture those insights on a more ongoing basis.

240
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,400
You know, we're doing it right now, you're having a conversation with me.

241
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,800
I am a director of marketing or digital marketer at an organization of a particular size and profile.

242
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
I am talking about the things.

243
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:03,900
I am doing and what I find interesting and what got me to where I am, these are all things that we can you could feed back into your overall strategy of.

244
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,300
Okay.

245
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Well how do I use that to change?

246
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,200
How I distribute a message to somebody like Alex in his role at as organization?

247
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:25,000
And so when these mechanisms exist and you're constantly speaking with and recording and Gathering insights from people that you ultimately are looking to engage with all of that.

248
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,700
Is it accessible.

249
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,500
Information.

250
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:33,300
All of that becomes fodder for each change in the strategy or change in the message or a change in the tactic.

251
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:55,200
Also, going directly to the sales organization listening to a ton of gone calls and you know, hot trying to look for certain keywords or phrases or things that topic areas that are of interest and to see what kinds of organizations are speaking about things or, you know, not trying to gain Insight through a game of telephone but going right to the source.

252
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,700
What are they?

253
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:05,800
On these calls that you could use in your own messaging more, you're using their words the, you know, the better off things are going to be as long as you're able to figure out how to package those things up.

254
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:12,200
So, you know, there's I would say, existing mechanisms in kind of all businesses to gain those insights.

255
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:22,100
Somebody in the company is having regular conversations with your audience and it's really figuring out how to tap into that or as a marketing organization, create platforms.

256
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:35,300
Like this, that allow you to speak with people that are, you know, Know your target audience or subject matter experts in your area that you can, then start to sort of feed those insights back into the broader team in a way that is more accessible or more.

257
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,100
Distributable.

258
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,700
So okay, II.

259
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,500
Love this.

260
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,400
And thank you for validating that.

261
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,200
Even this opportunity right now is sort of fact-finding.

262
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,900
B2B marketers is one of our targets, right?

263
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:55,700
So just to ask you a question, what type of messages resonate with you?

264
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:02,700
What type of going into 2023, again, you're probably getting hit up, DMS and Linkedin.

265
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,100
Emails are inundated.

266
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,500
I mean, that's the world of what a lot of Experience of beauty marketing.

267
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,500
But what's going to touch you differently?

268
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
What's going to grab your attention?

269
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,800
Alex, it is so difficult.

270
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,300
It's so hard.

271
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:59,200
And I know, I know full, well, I my attention to my inbox or, you know, the amount of phone calls that I get in a day, my attention can't always turn to those things and, and full transparency, I think a lot of folks, you know, A lot of folks know inherently know this and feel it in their personal lives and just generally we know this, and we also know that the tactics work but I have a hard time getting connected to a message in those mediums where it's somebody picking up the phone and calling me directly where it.

272
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:06,200
There's no sort of Preamble or there's no pre-existing awareness of what it is.

273
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:18,000
We're actually trying to The phone down to talk about or same thing in my inbox, my I think like most people, my email is a disaster site and it is so hard to find the things that are irrelevant.

274
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,500
Let alone, the things that are not what works for me personally.

275
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,199
And I can't say that's the same for anybody else is things like this.

276
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:56,000
When there is a platform of information that is Really high quality that I am able to go out and seek information from rather than it being pushed in front of me when I connect with a source more than I connect with a single episode or a single topic and I come back time and time again, more often than not, I am going to go to them.

277
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,100
I am going to, I am going to reach out when I have a need or a challenge or something.

278
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:13,200
That I think they can help me with because they have already proven that they can help me with it because Hi, I have listened to or watched or engaged with things over the course of several months.

279
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,700
It could be several years.

280
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:27,300
We think brought on drifts for first ballot early on, in my time at saris and I had been listening to their, their, their stuff and an engaging with their content for years prior to that.

281
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:35,300
And I just really had a sort of I wanted to be able to check it out in a way that was more advantageous to them.

282
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,800
But I was never to Into until I was.

283
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:44,900
And then when I was, I went directly to them, it wasn't a sales call, and there's, there're countless examples of that.

284
00:35:45,200 --> 00:36:14,700
We're usually when I get to the point of making a decision of being able to solve a problem, there's already a short list in my mind and that short list is probably pretty short because there're names that I recognize there's people that I feel like I can trust even if I have never spoken to them because I have spent the time and I put in the time to engage and consumed as much as I can, which is ultimately how I got to where I am I learned from others, I didn't, I didn't know any of this before I started, it's here.

285
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,700
It's all in service of engaging with others.

286
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:29,600
So, the more I am able to do that or sort of put out a bat signal in a community of people that I feel like I can trust, their opinions, it starts to narrow down the list.

287
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,000
So the message is really difficult.

288
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,700
The more that it's led by sort of entertainment and education and a Spurt.

289
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,300
He's the better off.

290
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:50,600
It, it lands with me but it takes a lot of time, and we don't always have time as marketers or especially not of the sales professionals which makes it all the harder.

291
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:58,200
So the more you can invest early on the better off you're going to be you know a year or two years from now but it's that's really the challenge that everybody is up against.

292
00:36:59,300 --> 00:36:59,900
It's good.

293
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:07,000
All right, so if anyone's got questions for Alex, feel free to drop them in QA looks like a has one question.

294
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:15,700
What are some tactics you have used to build brand awareness, especially at a time when budgets are getting tighter, yeah.

295
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:26,500
Our CEO has said this a couple of times in different contexts and there's this mentality of, you know, champagne results for beer money.

296
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:36,600
We're just because budgets tighten, doesn't necessarily mean that the, the execution of something needs to suffer, right?

297
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,700
On.

298
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:47,300
In most cases, when constraints are added into a process, it actually breathes a higher level of creativity because you have to be really creative.

299
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:47,700
Native.

300
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,800
And in some cases Scrappy to solve a problem.

301
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,100
And that's where a lot of the really robust and sort of meaningful ideas can come out of.

302
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:14,100
So the tactics might be the same in essence, but the way in which you execute, those things might just have an added layer of creativity added into that and I guess some examples of that.

303
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:42,300
We had a We had thrown a an event a few years ago for a product launch and you know, we weren't trying to do something so astronomically expensive, but we were trying to do something really meaningful, and we were trying to do something that really helps to play into the message of the day and the message of the day was all about creating experiences and that experience ultimately is what matters, right?

304
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:54,800
It's the things that we experience are what make them real the experiences that we seek out in The world are meaningful, the difference between a good experience in a bad experience, is so Monumental.

305
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:03,000
But both of those things stick out in our mind for different reasons, and the team spent a countless amount of time and putting their heads together, really?

306
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,900
Trying to figure out how to nail this thing?

307
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,000
And some of it was, was not thrown together.

308
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:19,400
It was, it was just done in such a way that Illustrated that concept, it was, you know, a bad experience entering into this venue versus A sort of red carpet experience.

309
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:26,600
The bad experience was just Solo cups and, you know, Gruff looking people and a dingy coat rack and a bat back kitchen.

310
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:32,300
But that helped illustrate exactly what we were trying to go for without having to spend even more money to help.

311
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,900
Really, you know, gussied up that part of the experience.

312
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:47,300
We also had thrown together a stand-in for a DMV to help illustrate the sort of antiquated ways that people create content.

313
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:56,700
And it's just like, brought this space to light, but it was all, you know, is, you know, rope and pipes and stuff that would kind of pull together in a really crafty way.

314
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,400
And we threw up a web page for that.

315
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,900
Using Sarah's in like an hour.

316
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,500
The designer did an awesome job, making it look purposefully bad.

317
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,700
But we just had a really fun afternoon trying to do that as quickly as we could.

318
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,800
Because they realize, hey we put a URL in the back.

319
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,200
Is this thing that were printing out?

320
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,100
Can you throw something up on the website?

321
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,300
Yeah, we could do that.

322
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:54,400
So, I mean it's finding ways of just having fun with it and creative executions on tight, constraints, actually make things feel like they're more meaningful as much as they as much as these flashy things people kind of they can see through the, the shine in a lot of cases and it just doesn't feel quite as real, you know, I think other ways to build awareness are just your content doesn't have to look and feel premium for it to be really meaningful and to be really authentic, and Be really entertaining.

323
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,400
I mean, look at any book.

324
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:06,200
It's just words on a page, but the feelings that generates are so varied that it's, it's insane.

325
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,300
I have a stack of books on my desk right behind my monitor.

326
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:16,600
That would be really, really sad to show people, but it's just, that is a mechanism.

327
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:22,600
That is very Lo-Fi in a lot of cases, but it's such a, it's still building a meaningful connection.

328
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,600
So, you know, there're ways of doing events, there're ways of doing virtual events in a really cost effective way.

329
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:39,100
And just having conversations with people, one-on-one to breed really creative ideas is a good place to start and say That's great.

330
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,900
Thank you for that.

331
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,200
I, you know, I wanted to dive a little bit into.

332
00:41:46,400 --> 00:42:06,900
I remember you talking about your collaboration with design and how you can work with different parts of the marketing org, that maybe you wouldn't normally do like a strategy brainstorm with or something like that, but you were talking about how its arrows, you all have done that and have had great outcomes results come out of it.

333
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:14,500
So could you describe your creative process to get to some of the ideas that you were even sharing?

334
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,400
Yeah.

335
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:49,100
It's fun because it's always evolving but it's, you know, I think it's marketing organizations for marketers and marketing teams we can think about things in a really linear fashion where we might have a sort of primary message that we're going for we create this long document of narrative, or We create this, Google doc with all of our messaging and maybe it's a blog post, maybe it's something longer, and we send that over to a designer when it's all said and done, we have created the strategy.

336
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:56,100
We have created the we know who the audience is, we have done all the research, we have created all the copy, and we send it over to somebody to essentially produce off of that.

337
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,700
Where it's just taking, you take this thing that I have already decided I am doing.

338
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,800
And can you make it look better?

339
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:11,100
It's and presentable, and we have found Time and time again, that the earlier in the process is that we Engage The Design Team.

340
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:29,300
The, the more involved, they are in the actual strategy development in the, the investigation of ideas the better off the end result is, you know, its it just opens up the conversation and ways that we might not have expected.

341
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,700
They will ask questions that we didn't think about.

342
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:38,400
They will ask us why a lot, and we More you ask the world.

343
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:38,800
Why?

344
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,500
And really dig into that.

345
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,700
Sometimes you don't always have an answer and maybe that's telling, right?

346
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,000
And then we need to kind of go back to the drawing board and figure some stuff out.

347
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,800
But having them involved.

348
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:57,900
From day one before it's, you know, really a solidified idea before it's something that is more concrete.

349
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,600
It is just a problem to solve designers and visual thinkers.

350
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,200
They think about solving problems in a very different way.

351
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:15,700
So instead of it being a very linear production, Yes, we try to make it more cyclical, we try to make it more collaborative from the beginning where that brief is put together.

352
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:28,200
There's a lot of iteration on just even the sort of underlying needs and you know feelings that we're trying to evoke or audiences that we're looking to go after what do we know about them?

353
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:37,200
How do we put all of that into this, this sort of shared understanding and this brief and from there, you know, the copy and the wireframe?

354
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:42,700
The design all feed off of each other and there's a lot of going back and refactoring things that aren't working.

355
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:53,800
There's a lot of sparking new ideas throughout the process, and then we ultimately end up in a place that's just more fun and more interesting and that shines through to the audience more.

356
00:44:53,800 --> 00:45:05,400
(So) than even the team that's creating it, you know, an example of that is, we recently were trying to create essentially, create more use case content.

357
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:39,600
We were trying to Showcase more or of how, you know, content created in Sarah's helps to solve for very particular pain points in the in these certain kinds of Industries, and we have examples from clients, we have a lot of examples of things that were created, and we just wanted to find a different way of presenting it, so we, it was pitched to us, as this idea, to essentially create a fake business, a fake brand with fake brand guidelines, with a very outlandish product, and they had the very same challenges that a lot of (Is) have and here's exactly how they did it.

358
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:51,200
And what that piece of content looks like and what their messaging looks like in context and it allowed us to create this really fun story and really Branch off of that in very different ways but the end result is the same.

359
00:45:51,200 --> 00:46:04,000
We connect it to a pain point, that a very real business will have and it's very much also shows what exactly they can do to solve for this problem and ultimately connect that back to a product value.

360
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:09,300
This product is called the, the ripe So detector, so that you always get to that.

361
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:17,200
Exact ripe avocado before it goes, starts to go bad in your drawer and I think people just had fun with it.

362
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:25,100
We had fun creating it and the team just had a lot of fun ideas to bacon at this, and we would never have come up with that on our own.

363
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,500
We just wouldn't have we would have gone a little bit more traditional, which ultimately wouldn't have really felt like saris.

364
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:36,600
And we're thankful to have partners that really push us to think outside of the box on that.

365
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,700
So good.

366
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:47,900
All right, we have a couple of more questions that have come through saline is asking, what is top of mind for you go into 2023?

367
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,000
What are some things you will be doubling down on ya.

368
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:59,000
We have spent a lot of time over the last few months thinking about our event strategy.

369
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,900
And you know what has been working for us?

370
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,200
What hasn't necessarily been working quite as well?

371
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,200
So we are spending a lot of time.

372
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,700
Time thinking through.

373
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:20,000
How do we take that same ethos of creating really interesting digital experiences and make those come to life in a physical space as well?

374
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,000
Or at least make sure that the same things are true.

375
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:29,500
That the same constraints are there that the same, the same sort of guiding principles are there?

376
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:40,700
And, you know, as we have been sort of rebuilding and building out our field marketing team and thinking through our representation and Different markets and sort of building the plan for next year.

377
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:48,700
I find there's just so much opportunity for us to think about the in-person representation of the brand.

378
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,200
And how does that lead to the conversations that we want to have?

379
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,400
Yes, the operational sort of underpinnings to that is something.

380
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:02,500
I have spent personally a lot of time on to make sure that we're buttoning, things up in the right ways and that the strategy is more sound.

381
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:09,400
But you know, the creative execution of that is so important to it is the first People see when they're walking by, they see your booth.

382
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:17,400
They see the representation of the product they see touch screens or you know, just visual cues makes them want to come and speak with you.

383
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,800
And that is really important in an in-person event.

384
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,800
So it's a strategy that's worked really well for us.

385
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:29,000
And we're trying to find ways of making it work, exponentially better in the years to come.

386
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:42,700
And then I think what's really top of mind for me is just how do I ensure as the team is executing and really focused on The objectives and the goals that we are tying all these things together as best we possibly can.

387
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,600
How is the digital engine, helping to support the demand generation campaigns, that are very specific to an audience?

388
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,800
How does that tie into the content strategy and our editorial planning?

389
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:04,600
What are some of these really interesting out their stories that are still really hyper relevant to the audience's that we care about on the downstream effect and in our sales and marketing Pipeline?

390
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:24,400
And how do we make sure that it's just, we're, we're amplifying, the things that we can amplify, and we're making sure that the all of these components are working together to build this much bigger representation of what we want to be seen as a known for and it all helps to showcase the power of the platform in different ways.

391
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:33,100
So that's really top of mind for me, as we enter into next year because it will last couple of years have really been, how do we just navigate, what's in front of us?

392
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:40,800
And it's just, we're sort of, you know, riding the waves to some And that's not going to change, but there's a lot that we can do in that.

393
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:52,600
I can focus on to help ensure that at the very least, the team has solid foundation and structure as possible to just collaborate as best we can, that's huge.

394
00:49:52,600 --> 00:50:03,100
I think that alignment and collaboration and the currency of the trust and structure that you're providing is going to be really critical going into 2023 as far as events.

395
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,900
So that's interesting that you all are looking at in-person events in particular.

396
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,400
What conferences Summits in person events?

397
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,600
Are you all looking at for next year?

398
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:18,900
Yeah, there's a number we have had a lot of success at, you know, going back to HubSpot.

399
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:26,400
We have had a lot of successes in bounds and it's, it's a, so I was there in September in person.

400
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:37,100
And first time, I would been since 2019, I think it's the first time we as an organization have been and it was just the, I think it was also unique to that.

401
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:37,800
Here.

402
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:45,800
Everyone was so happy to be there and the energy level of people being in person and talking to their co-workers.

403
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:55,800
And the people that are in a very shared similar space was pretty electric and people were really interested in.

404
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:12,900
And what you know, the organization's had to say the sessions were really compelling and I also think they just did a really incredible job of to refactoring the layout of the space to account for just the reality of what today actually needs versus, you know, a few years ago.

405
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,600
But you know that's a pretty big one for us.

406
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:29,800
We're looking at the Adobe, you know, Summit and Adobe Max to connect with, you know, the marketing and design audiences in different ways where there's a number of other events that have started to come onto the scene for us more.

407
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:36,500
So in the last couple of years obviously is everything is shifted virtually or did shift virtually entirely for a couple of years.

408
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:48,800
There's a number of vendors that do really high quality meeting setting, like one-to-one conversations that are happening both in person and virtually that had just been incredible pipeline builders for us and any organization.

409
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:56,900
And we're going to make sure to continue to do those as we get back to some of these bigger conferences, just to be able to show off the brand more.

410
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:04,300
Those are really about just in connecting the product story, as deeply as we can to people that have a very particular need and challenge.

411
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,100
So we're trying to find the right mix.

412
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,700
That's great.

413
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:08,600
All right.

414
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,800
Spencer has a question here.

415
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,400
This will probably be our last question.

416
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,700
That will take you mentioned.

417
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:20,200
That one of the most effective ways of marketing to you is to be a respected resource.

418
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,400
How would you justify and monitor an approach like this?

419
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,500
That would likely take a while to see results from?

420
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:27,500
Yeah.

421
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,300
It's especially if you're a small team, it's a hard thing.

422
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,500
It's because there's such immediate needs to help bolster the business.

423
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:41,200
Des and it does, it takes a lot of time, you know, I think like anything.

424
00:52:41,200 --> 00:53:00,100
There's there needs to be pretty clear expectations set up front around what you believe it is ultimately going to take and that's going to take time, it's going to take resources is going to take a little bit of patience, may be a lot of patients in some cases but just because it is going to take a lot of time.

425
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:06,600
Doesn't mean that it's not going to show some promise earlier on and that promise might be not might not be in.

426
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,700
The form of pipeline that might not be in the form of closed, one business.

427
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:18,600
It might not even be in the form of, you know, people coming to you and saying explicitly, they want to use your solution, or they're interested in learning more about your product.

428
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:40,500
But if you are getting the right, personas the right organizations, the right kinds of individuals, engaging with that, Clark property or that content or that, you know that particular you know, series whatever that format is and you're getting some qualitative feedback that's really helping to bolster the effectiveness of it.

429
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:47,500
That can be enough to go on in the early days it can be enough to show that you were saying the right kinds of things.

430
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:53,100
The right kinds of individuals are finding it and now it is about how do you iterate on that strategy?

431
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,200
How do you build more Foundation underneath it to hell?

432
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:12,000
A pre engage and bring them back to learn more about the product because one effort and one tactics, not going to do it all, it's not going to help solve this Big Brand Story and help build a point of view and also showcase the product in a really compelling way.

433
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,200
It's really hard to do that.

434
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,100
All on through one, through one mouthpiece, or one lens.

435
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:26,200
So the expectations and the, the ways that you measure that need to be different and it's likely going to be pretty qualitative.

436
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:38,400
Especially in the early days but you know if you have the right, you know, the right c-level executive of the right company saying like well that was really interesting there and all they're doing is leaving a comment on a social post that might be enough.

437
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,100
It might be enough to show, you know, show your boss to say people are engaging in the right people are engaging.

438
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:59,400
We need to figure out a way to make this more sustainable or maybe a little bit more efficient or, you know, pump a little bit more into this to figure out how we you know, broaden that mouthpiece to really capitalize on what's working, but it is.

439
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,700
It's a journey and it can be a really difficult one.

440
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:05,300
When the pressure is on for that in quarter, pipe line objective.

441
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:09,300
That is also staring you down, so it's not easy.

442
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,500
But that's what I would look.

443
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,800
For is whatever early signals.

444
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:19,600
You can possibly find that show that you're moving in the right general direction, because you're never going to get it right the first time.

445
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,800
That's good.

446
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,600
That's good.

447
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:32,600
So for the teams we need to determine those early signals and you said it could be as simple as like a third-party solicited message.

448
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,600
You know, from our targeted buyer or something like that.

449
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:43,500
That's not necessarily an mql conversion but you know an early detector like you said.

450
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,600
So that's good to know.

451
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,300
Awesome.

452
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,700
All right, Alex.

453
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,500
Well thank you so much.

454
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:56,200
For taking the time with us today to just drop your wisdom and knowledge for us.

455
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:04,600
Could you leave us with one word of encouragement or advice for the B2B marketing community?

456
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,200
Yeah.

457
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:19,400
As you join any organization, it can be very overwhelming to learn the business and the buyer and the things that are working or not working.

458
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,900
And all of the things that you, you just need to absorb as somebody in an organization.

459
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:50,800
But I think anywhere you go, it's important not to lose you and your individuality, and the things that make you unique because they hired you, they hired you for a reason, the way that you present yourself the way that you see the world, the way that you know, just the way that you approach the work, whatever, whatever the case might be, there're things that make us who we are, that, that are valuable to any organization.

460
00:56:50,800 --> 00:57:01,300
And when you can figure out a way to make your individuality mesh with the company objectives and those big picture goals, that's really where the magic happens.

461
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:09,600
You know, I am I fancy myself a musician, I have not spent nearly enough time investing in that over the last few years.

462
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:18,800
Especially with twins but the things that I find Value in our those creative Pursuits.

463
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:33,500
And even though I am a much more Revenue focused Market or today, I still make sure that I am engaging in Creative Pursuits, either in the office or outside of, or having these conversations that feel fulfilling in that vein because it's important to me.

464
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:51,500
And when it's important to me and I feel more fulfilled by that, then I give more to the organization that I am a part of, so I think that's just so important just, you know, not to Lose Yourself to the big, the big machine around us, and they will be better off for it when they're able to find ways of enabling that as well.

465
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,200
Wow, such a powerful Point.

466
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,200
Thank you so much.

467
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:02,700
I mean, I think that is right on about not losing yourself because it's you can get overwhelmed.

468
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,400
Not just even with the business needs.

469
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:14,600
But you go on LinkedIn and it's like Doom, scroll with how many layoffs taking but like all these different Marketplace factors and the economy and all these things.

470
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:22,500
But at the end of the day, there is a special magic that each person brings to an organization.

471
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:27,900
And we need to hold onto that if anything double down on that, going into 2023.

472
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,600
Exactly amazing.

473
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,000
All right.

474
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,900
Alex will, it's been a pleasure.

475
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,500

476
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:43,200
