Awesome.

69
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Well I am really excited about the discussion that we're going to jump into before we do that.

70
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,500
I have got a few fun facts, and we love our fun facts.

71
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,000
Here.

72
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:33,300
So each of you also have fun facts are, so I will start with mine, I used to do a lot of Television, movies in my early 20s and I actually did a lot of work with Ugly Betty.

73
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,000
And so she was the lead actress, and I was in the back.

74
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,700
There's the shot right there, love that, and so I will hand it over to you Latin me.

75
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,300
What's a fun fact about you?

76
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,600
Well, I think I have about 200 pairs of shoes, maybe more.

77
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:05,600
So actually, my husband had to like, redo the attic crawl space to house them all.

78
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:14,400
So yeah, just you know, it's always a confidence booster when you're rocking a cool pair of shoes.

79
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,700
So there you go, upset, awesome.

80
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,400
I am handing it over to you Amanda.

81
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,600
I wish that was my fun fact.

82
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I want 200 pairs of shoes.

83
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:42,100
That's what I want my friend back to be mine is I am related to two of the three people who have ever broken out of Alcatraz which you know I guess as a marketer I am very crafty is the way that I will put that but really there.

84
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,600
I never knew them.

85
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,500
But a couple years ago we did the family tree through ancestry and discovered that.

86
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:49,700
Yeah.

87
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,300
Yeah, I am related to two of the three people like shared a shared.

88
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,800
A maiden name on my mother's side.

89
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,600
So wow.

90
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,300
That's an incredible fun fact.

91
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,600
I do love the rock Bethany and so it really was a full circle moment for me when I discovered this.

92
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,800
Yeah, crafty, that's how I am choosing.

93
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,800
Did you do that?

94
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,300
Awesome.

95
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,700
Well, thank you for sharing some of your fun facts jumping right into this conversation.

96
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:27,100
So, you know, as we know to set in the landscape here, Tech has been uncertain tumultuous to say the least.

97
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,700
Layoffs, marketing resources, budgets getting tighter.

98
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,300
Marketers needing to rethink the way we do marketing.

99
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:44,900
And we look at forecasting and budgeting, Amanda your team just Put together this amazing report on software, buyer behaviors.

100
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:53,300
And I think if there's any G2 team members, if y'all can drop that in chat, that's a really great report that we can take a look at and Latin me.

101
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,300
I have seen your LinkedIn post where you're tracking close with the Forester.

102
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,100
B2B Trends, drop in your predictions.

103
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,600
I mean, I just want to get the poles from each of you.

104
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:10,300
What are the key trends and insights that you're seeing, what do you agree with what do you disagree with?

105
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,600
With could you share with us your thoughts?

106
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:21,100
Well, I will share some of the insights from the G2 report, and then we maybe can take some of the themes I know Latin.

107
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,300
He's been focused on and tracking as well.

108
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,700
I think one of the key themes that we have seen for a couple of years now but was most acute in this research report?

109
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,100
Thank you.

110
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,900
Jenny just shared it here in the chat.

111
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,600
Was that more than ever buyers are looking to?

112
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:43,500
If you ask them what's your top source of influence when you're deciding, what you're going to use particularly for software those responses.

113
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,900
Has been overwhelmingly.

114
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,500
I am turning to my peers and influencers that I know and trust.

115
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:57,900
And so what that means for anyone, in who's looking for software marketing software is you really need to be thinking about whom, how am I leaning into Community?

116
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,400
Soul at knee, and sixth sense?

117
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:08,500
Has this amazing group of 2,000 plus CMOS and how am I allowing my customers to talk to other customers and potential prospects?

118
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:31,800
And certainly you know, peer reviews and G2 is a great way to do that but there's a whole host of other Are ways that you can lean into, you know, really peer influence to help potential buyers, make more informed decisions so that's one Trend we're seeing I think the other Trend we're seeing is that there's a lot more consolidation in software and text acts as people look to next year.

119
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,300
And so it just means the bar is higher.

120
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,900
It doesn't mean there's not opportunity.

121
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,800
There actually is a lot of opportunity in that statement, but it does mean the bar is higher.

122
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:48,100
So, for those who know me, I am a control freak, I try to let go but it's very challenging for me.

123
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,600
And, so I guess, first of all, you know, our number one job in marketing is the market.

124
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:04,000
And you know it makes us even more relevant when markets are changing, right?

125
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,400
We saw that with covid too.

126
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,100
And so, our job is to adjust to changing market conditions.

127
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,700
And help kind of steer the ship so to speak.

128
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:27,900
And I think that when the market is changing frequently there you got to control what you can control and to me, you know what I am advising and what we're working on is doing that and there's three big buckets for me.

129
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:40,600
One, is your ideal customer profile and it's so interesting to me how, you know, when times are good, you might not need to be as refined and diligent around this.

130
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:49,600
But when ties, maybe aren't as good, you have got to really understand your ideal customer profile and eliminate waste, right?

131
00:12:49,600 --> 00:13:01,000
Because if you're spending a lot of sales and marketing energy, and even product energy, just company, energy trying to be everything to everybody, you know.

132
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,600
I think you're going to quickly a struggle and so and you might need to rethink it.

133
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,000
So every time there's a shift in the market you need to reconsider you know, is that Deal customer profile.

134
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,700
Maybe there are more affected by this economy.

135
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,900
So, maybe we need to start to warm up, other, slivers of art, am that are less affected.

136
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,300
So, that's number one for stand.

137
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,200
First, and foremost ideal customer profile.

138
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,000
And then the in Market ideal customer profile, know those.

139
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,900
And then the second thing for me, is your message and your value prop.

140
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:45,400
So, you know, again, in times of abundance, You know, it's could be a different message, and value prop.

141
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,100
We're not in a time of abundance and so yeah.

142
00:13:49,100 --> 00:14:00,300
If you have a consolidation Story, Probably a good time to dust that one off right, you know, and I don't want to go out with an in these uncertain times.

143
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,800
Message.

144
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:10,900
That's pretty tired, but rethinking, you know, how what is your, what is your Mary thinking and feeling and needing right now?

145
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,200
Now, and how do you connect with them?

146
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:26,600
So we just rolled out our new kind of the highest level message, which is proceeded with confidence and, and that's been really effective for us, but we had to quickly pivot come up with that, get it out.

147
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:34,000
And so, you know, I would challenge folks to do the same and then last, the third pillar is execution.

148
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,700
We can control how well we execute, and we can control how efficiently we execute.

149
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,600
So I would say, you know, teams everywhere ours included are thinking about, you know where how do we eliminate waste?

150
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,500
You know, what are the things that we did last year?

151
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
That maybe weren't that great.

152
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Let us cut them and so and I have a lot more under that pillar but you know, those are three things.

153
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,100
I see p message and execution, that's what we can control, hmm.

154
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,000
That's good.

155
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
That's that those are right on.

156
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:16,900
When it comes to buying behavior and patterns going into 2023, what are some observations that you have about those patterns?

157
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,100
How will they shift as companies?

158
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,200
Decrease, their budgets and Workforce.

159
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,500
I can take this one and then I will throw it to you.

160
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:36,600
So a couple things one we are seeing its harder so just know it's harder, right?

161
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,100
Let us not expect it to be the same, right?

162
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:46,000
And, and so, when I say it's harder, and I am sure Amanda has probably more broad data on this, but this is just my own data.

163
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,200
So we look at every single deal that we won in the previous quarter.

164
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,900
And then we just look at all the patterns.

165
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,300
How many contacts do we need engaged?

166
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,600
And how many activities did we need to get from one stage to the next just raw math?

167
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:07,800
And we when we look at our raw math and I bet everyone is feeling this, it's more people engaged and it's more steps per stage.

168
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:15,000
So, just like when you go to the grocery store, your salary, doesn't go as far we're experiencing inflation.

169
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,200
And that, you know, it's, it takes more work to get a deal done.

170
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:29,200
And so, I think we need to understand that and how we collaborate across Teams to scale up our efforts and address that kind of call.

171
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,600
I would call it by, you know, deal inflation.

172
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:54,300
The other thing I would say is there are going to be probably fewer deals and so if you aren't Savvy about capturing signal like Now's the Time because you can't afford to miss out on deals right now and you can't afford to not be relevant, you're going to have to be all over the deals that are in.

173
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,000
It and make sure that you're highly relevant.

174
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,800
And so, and there're all kinds, there's always new forms of intent data.

175
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,400
You know, we're talking a lot about pre intent data.

176
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:16,700
So understanding tangential, buying patterns, understanding hiring patterns, understanding job, posting patterns, you know, all of these things help you understand, you know, is a company growing, are they investing where they invest?

177
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,300
Does it look like they have a problem?

178
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:31,200
And then, of course, the classic kind of, you know, first party and third T and then you know some of the things that like Amanda and G2 does like someone's researching you and your competition and you don't know about it.

179
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,900
That's kind of bad that's irresponsible.

180
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:40,300
I think right now given there are going to be less potential opportunities to go after.

181
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,200
I think I am just going to Echo a lot of what Latin he's that?

182
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,600
I mean, in the research report, that's linked here we did.

183
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Ask buyers, you know, how many stages are there?

184
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,000
How long is it taking you to do deals?

185
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,300
How many people are involved?

186
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:12,900
The thing that stood out to me the most in that part of the study was that eighty percent of buyers said we make consensus-based decisions, which is terrifying, right?

187
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,100
Because your Having a conversation, you think you know who the decision maker is and the reality?

188
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,400
Yes.

189
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:27,600
As a seller that's incredibly hard and so you know, ICP matters more than ever be really focused, but it's not just who do you think is the decision maker?

190
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:40,300
It's who's going to be part of that decision because the reality is to see if I was probably part of that decision, you know there's going to be people from maybe depending on if you're Marty Goetz sales and marketing sitting at the table making that decision.

191
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:51,600
And so your job as a marketer is to also think about Who is our kind of core ICP and then the decision-making set around that and what is the message we need to bring to those parties?

192
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,800
So that when they're at the table making that decision, they're all aligned on why they should choose you.

193
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,300
And so, that does make the deals harder.

194
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:05,900
Because it's more complex for buyers to make decisions and more complex for us to Market and sell to those decision-makers.

195
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:13,500
And then the other thing that we're seeing is there is going to be, there are going to be fewer deals and your and there are going to be fewer deals that result in any sort of lot.

196
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,900
People are research mode.

197
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,400
Yeah, so it doesn't want to be able to look for mazing.

198
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Yes, and I am conversion, rates are low and so, to lambie's point, really understanding within your own data set, what is within our control here?

199
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,000
Can we incentivize deals to close faster this year?

200
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,900
Can we keep really be clear about when a deal is probably just in research mode?

201
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,000
How do you keep them warm?

202
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But then not overtax your sales and marketing resources on deals that aren't going to maybe Because they're not ready to make the deal.

203
00:19:46,000 --> 00:20:01,300
So I think just getting really Savvy on who is the buying committee and then within deals being savvier about how do we get more of them to close and be smarter about knowing which ones maybe aren't going close knowing that again fewer deals to be had top of funnel.

204
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,800
May look great, but we all know it's not converting as well.

205
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:12,100
Yeah, I want to double down on one of your points and actually introduced a term that I find marketers aren't as familiar with.

206
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:21,500
But There's a term in sales called multi-threading and if you're in marketing, it's a it's an important concept to understand.

207
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,700
So right now, there's a forecast call happening somewhere in the world.

208
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,800
Probably many.

209
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:33,000
And some poor AE is getting in big-time trouble because his deal is not multi-threaded.

210
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,100
He's only talking to one person, or she there, and they're only talking to one person.

211
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:53,900
And the sales manager is saying, there's no way that's going close and you can say, that's not my problem, but it is our problem as marketers, and we and actually the longer a deal progresses the harder, it is to multi-thread.

212
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,600
So what does that mean for you?

213
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,900
And me as marketers we can start multi-threading much earlier than typically we do.

214
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:10,200
And that's one of my challenges with passing a quote-unquote lead because a lead is a single contact.

215
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,600
And that's a single-threaded deal.

216
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,900
That's not good for sales.

217
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:25,100
So think start to think about your SLA is like, when an account comes inbound, why do you just follow up with the person who were requested a demo?

218
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:31,700
If you're buying teams, 810 people, you probably should try to get at least three or four meetings right then and there, right?

219
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:39,900
And so three think you're SLA s with both your intent-based leads and your just classic inbound funnel.

220
00:21:40,100 --> 00:22:07,100
If you are B2B and you're seeing this contact thing and like you can be a force multiplier to the selling cycle, by having multi-thread plays early, and then even as the deal advances, Is there any advice you have on like the number of contacts that marketing could be warming up for sales?

221
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,500
You know, how is there a good number that strategically?

222
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,800
You know when we die Lander?

223
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,200
ICP, here're the companies.

224
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,400
How what do you recommend there?

225
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:27,000
I mean we have landed on three or four because if you look at you know what used to be six for us is now 13.

226
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:41,500
So you know and you want to be clear about whom those key personas are and then that could mean changes to comp plans for you know some of your Frontline roles like mdrs like SDR.

227
00:22:41,500 --> 00:23:01,900
So you do want to be clear about these are the personas that qualify for LT thread but, but, you know, me, we put out a CFO ebook recently and are promoting that just as, you know, are cover because guess what, a CFO or a finance business partner is going to be involved.

228
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,800
So we want them to understand what we do and the value prop we provide.

229
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,200
So things like that.

230
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:31,000
Yeah, I think there's the in multi-threading and marketing, you can do the proactive, you know, a Cover is Latin, he said, like be very clear on who is within that decision committee and where are you going to actually create messaging and plays targeted to them and the accounts you care about or a counselor showing intent and then one that is really enabling conversations within the organization.

231
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:55,100
So are there things that you can do one of the most successful plays I ever ran a multi-threading was actually creating conversations around topics that could bring those personas together sometimes across multiple accounts, not a selling conversation, just a relationship building Isolation that in this environment, maybe it is a great conversation to have, you know, the CFO, the head of marketing and the head of sales joining around table.

232
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,900
For example, with other peers, you can facilitate that in a way that helps, you understand and build those relationships.

233
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:11,600
And so there's that are cover within the broader ecosystem of accounts and then really doubling down on how do you create more relationship building experiences within the accounts that matter?

234
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,500
Most, especially if your you have longer deal Cycles, you have time to Do that.

235
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,700
But you have to be really proactive in which accounts need that kind of attention, hmmm.

236
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,500
So there's an interesting question.

237
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:29,600
That actually Spencer, Tucci is asking right now, I think is relevant to this how much time effort.

238
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,100
Do you spend your on the?

239
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,400
We put on stage, there you go.

240
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,700
How much time effort?

241
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,800
Do you spend marketing to secondary personas to enable, multi threading, compared to primary?

242
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,200
Is it more or less, or even split or something more, like, 70/30 percent?

243
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,400
Like how do you approach this when resources are thinner?

244
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,200
You know, we have got to be better.

245
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,100
Words of where we focus our time and our dollars.

246
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,200
So, it's interesting because I don't think that we have thought about it.

247
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:28,200
This way currently, but as I am looking at my future budget, I am going to start, I would say soft allocating program spend based on our key personas because what it's just like with anything you find that the ones that you know, and understand and have done before you, you continue to do more and more of and you know doing something new is always a new muscle.

248
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:49,700
So you know, we're going to be doing that and kind of have RV to Mom and some of our kpis, more tied to again, looking at our ICP and then within that IC PR, you know, are the best Persona fit, you know, we're finding that maybe we need to kind of force rotate to some other personas.

249
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,000
So I would say, look at your deal like, like, do the look back.

250
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:05,800
Look at One deals and look at the patterns and then that's how you determine the percentage for you, you know what's a winning pattern and how do you tap into winning patterns over and over again.

251
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,300
Yeah, I think that's right.

252
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,500
And I don't think it's going to look the same for every business because the weight of different personas in a deal cycle.

253
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,100
May be different.

254
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:23,300
If it's, you know, for example if you're a CV is 10 grand to, you're probably not going to over index on the CFO as much as if your deals six-figure +, right.

255
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:38,200
So, you know, I think the it's multi-threading is going to be pretty important, no matter what you're selling and to whom, but I think how important the various personas are Depends greatly on your product, your personas and Then, of course you're a CD.

256
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,900
Makes sense.

257
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
We got another multi-threading question here from Eric.

258
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
We have opened think I do?

259
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Can I know it's a good topic is with multi-threading increasing more and more?

260
00:26:52,800 --> 00:27:02,700
Do you believe it would be beneficial to try and reach advisors to that company as well, to create more relationships and take it a step deeper on pain and priorities?

261
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Well, you learn in Seattle's gravity, only goes one way.

262
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,700
So yeah.

263
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,600
I mean, if and I think when you say advisors you probably mean like board and that level.

264
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:25,300
So yeah, if you gravity goes one way, so I would say the higher, you can get and the higher you can get introduced, obviously the better.

265
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,800
Yeah, I agree with that.

266
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,900
That I would depend on your interpretation of advisors but assuming you're talking about board then.

267
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,800
Yes, awesome.

268
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:46,500
So going back to I know you kind of went into a little bit of squid squirrel here with multi-threading but it's such a solid strategy.

269
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,300
So, thank you for bringing that up.

270
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:56,300
We do have a question here from Alina and you know, it's going back up to sort of the metrics and how it what we're presenting.

271
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,300
Ink on a quarterly basis from your perspective, we're going into 2023.

272
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,500
How should we look at metrics and what do you advise in?

273
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:06,800
How?

274
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,900
We present a not just to the board?

275
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,500
I would ask.

276
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:21,800
But also to your leadership and to your team and to your organization, there're multiple tiers, there of communicating this Well, I know a lot knee has a great answer for this one.

277
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,700
I would say, I we do a couple of things.

278
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,400
So we also use the framework lightning reference, which is the V2 mom framework to set our goals.

279
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:37,600
If you do is you're familiar with okrs it's similar it's just a different acronym and approach but similar end result.

280
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,400
And so we have primary kpis that I actually put into sort of scoreboard for marketing.

281
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,800
And the first thing I do is you want to be Abel.

282
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,500
So they're not seeing different things from are getting every quarter because then it's like, well, what are you really focused on?

283
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,400
So at the beginning of the year, we set our scoreboard, we're repeating that every quarter, and we're reporting out on our metrics.

284
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:10,100
And I always make sure, of course, everyone cares about pipeline, but I always make sure it also includes other metrics, even if the board's, maybe not keep it up in mind.

285
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,500
So we always have a brand metrics.

286
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:30,500
So what are we really trying to achieve for our brand and for positioning so that we're balancing short and long-term even in this climate that Really important especially in this climate because a lot of people won't do that and if you invest in your brand now you will come out better later and then I actually include an efficiency metric because even if they don't ask, they're thinking about it.

287
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:37,900
And I am so glad that we do that because now in this climate, if someone says, how are you looking at the efficiency of what marketing is spending will?

288
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,300
We have had an answer for a while, and we have that as part of our scoreboard.

289
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:47,400
And, so I think just thinking about what are the things that you need to do to solve the businesses goals.

290
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:59,600
Goals, and what can you achieve as a team, and then putting that into something that, you know, makes it clear the value you deliver across the business and then making sure you're showing yourselves as good stewards of the business as part of that.

291
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,200
So, we actually have, you know what?

292
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,700
We call an efficiency metric and there's a whole methodology behind it, we reported a recorder.

293
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,500
So I would say so similar.

294
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,200
So yes.

295
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:22,200
And, and the way I think about V2, mom versus my dashboard is because we use V2.

296
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,400
Mom to those are the kpi.

297
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,500
Those are the things we're doing to change and evolve the business.

298
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:41,900
And so those have an Associated group of kpis and then there's what we're doing to like run the business and sort of report on the health of our Pipeline, and I am You know, pretty opinionated about how we do that.

299
00:30:41,900 --> 00:31:07,200
Here, we create essentially pipeline quotas and so, it's marketing's responsibility to not necessarily owned all of pipeline creation, but be the stewards of measuring all of pipeline creation and be the stewards of indicating how we're doing against the plan and so, you know, it's pretty simple.

300
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,900
I look at you know for top of fun.

301
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,900
Do I look at ICP website traffic?

302
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,500
So are we getting the right contacts and accounts to our website at an increasing basis?

303
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,800
You know, pretty simple.

304
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,400
We have the concept of tier one account, so I look at penetration of Tier 1 accounts.

305
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:34,000
That's another good kind of top of funnel Focus metric and then you know deals don't happen without meetings.

306
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,900
So we track meetings and how those meetings.

307
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Grass and then stage two for us, which is Pipeline.

308
00:31:42,800 --> 00:32:00,000
And the interesting thing about it is we're looking at like raw created Pipeline, and we look by segment by Channel, and then we're always tracking win rates conversions and asps because that's what you used to come up with how much pipeline you need to create.

309
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:15,000
And so, what I love about the dashboard is it has pipelined, created count and dollar but then right next to it has the ASP cycle times and win rates that we assumed and it goes, right?

310
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,300
And if we assumed a 40% win rate and oh by the way, we're at a 35% win rate.

311
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
That's a problem.

312
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,600
So those red.

313
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,900
So we know, okay, we need to do something about this or if the cycle time show slows down, right?

314
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:38,700
So it keeps that check and balance of us, not just creating a ton of Pipeline and feeling super happy.

315
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:50,900
That Create a pipeline in it and it's not progressing or something like that or and it and also allows us to drill down by go to market segment, because sometimes, you can look good holistically.

316
00:32:51,100 --> 00:33:00,500
But then you can start to drill in, and you see, oh, well, actually, the commercial segment is, is not hitting their pipeline numbers and Strat had a great month.

317
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,900
And they had all these big lumpy things come in and that masked like this other.

318
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:15,200
So you have to like really drill in and be looking at it on kind of That basis to keep the pace healthy.

319
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,800
And that's a big priority for us.

320
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,500
It's the best way to future-proof.

321
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,500
Your bookings are future proof your pipeline, so that's kind of how we think about it.

322
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:59,100
And then I would say yes and on efficiency, we have kind of version of almost a CAC, and it's sort of like, what we spent a couple quarters ago versus the pipeline we created this quarter and you know, there's no perfect metric but the faster you get to something that is Trackable and everyone understands and trendabl the better, and then we do like basic Roi for any big program or big chunk of spend.

323
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,400
We're going to be looking for at least a 10 times Roi on that.

324
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:08,000
So and we stack rank every quarter with a qvr how we progress against those?

325
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,800
So some of the ways we kind of measure so good, thank you for breaking that all down.

326
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,500
I feel like I need to re-watch these segments and captured some detailed notes here, you know.

327
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:29,000
It gets me thinking about then, okay, in order to be successful, obviously we need to work as a team across all go to market.

328
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:37,500
And I know both of you talk a lot about sales and marketing alignment and even customer success alignment going into 2023.

329
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:52,699
And actually, Spencer asked another question that sort of aligned to this, you know, he's an Asking here what does sales and marketing really need to get aligned on in 2023 in order to be successful in all these strategies and different things that you're bringing up?

330
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,199
Like what does that look like?

331
00:34:54,199 --> 00:35:01,100
And I would also include customer success into that and I know customer marketing is another topic that we're going to tackle a little bit.

332
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,200
But what's what are your thoughts to that alignment?

333
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,400
So we talked about functional metrics which is great.

334
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:27,800
You have to have a bead on your functional metrics, but I think also just good financial literacy and alignment on the highest level metrics and in assurance that the whole team understands that.

335
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:36,400
So we talked about efficiency sales and marketing share of wallet, and ultimately a board is going to be looking at kak.

336
00:35:36,700 --> 00:36:18,100
So we can be the most efficient little beans but if you know were doing crazy stuff on sale sales it's just not going to work and vice versa and so you know things like gross retention, net retention, you know, are per employee like there's just a lot of kind of like overarching things that like indicate the health of us a specific, your SAS company, which we are indicated that and I think just making sure that It everybody on the team has Financial like literacy around those and how every single, you know, we're all like cells in the big organism, right?

337
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,400
And we all can contribute to those.

338
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And so, I think keeping those top of mind, so you don't get to myopic in your own functional metrics.

339
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,600
Yeah, I think that's right.

340
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:39,200
We were actually I was just having a conversation with my team about this about sort of like, let us talk holistically about next year and not marketing or sales but just like holistically across the business.

341
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,300
What do we need to achieve?

342
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,600
And I think taking that down to like what is sales and marketing have to get aligned on the first one is that?

343
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,800
Where is growth going to come from next year?

344
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:54,400
And then if your plan looks the same, your Revenue plan, your sales plan, your marketing plan.

345
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,800
Next year, you're probably not making enough big changes.

346
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,200
Not that you have to make totally radical swings by like next year's probably gonna look different.

347
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,900
Your plans should probably look different.

348
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,000
So what we have done is we have said, okay, what do we need to achieve next year?

349
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,400
How is that going to be different?

350
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,000
And then what is the role of sales and marketing to do that?

351
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,500
So what is the role of sales versus Marketing in driving nrr?

352
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,700
And we want to have a really collaborative relationship in a world of abundance.

353
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,500
Where we came from, we could all just go.

354
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:34,200
Go against all the metrics that the Game time together really fast in a world where the board is looking at Blended sales and marketing efficiency.

355
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:39,900
Well, what can I do to have a more collaborative relationship, and so we're not duplicating efforts?

356
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:45,000
How can we best support each other in the most efficient way possible and you might make different choices?

357
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,500
So I think that's a really important one is what do you need to achieve for the business?

358
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:57,900
And then what is the handshake role and relationship for sales or CS forces marketing to achieve those kpis?

359
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Is going into next year, and we actually do that by segment and by metrics so that we understand like on Enterprise.

360
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
For example, what's the role of marketing versus sales?

361
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,200
And then when there is you know what's the role of this?

362
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Yes team as well.

363
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,300
So that's really clear.

364
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Here's the top line of what we need to do in the segment and then here's what each team and function what we need to do and deliver.

365
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:28,900
Is there a recommended Cadence like howdy just practically speaking like on a week-to-week monthly?

366
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:36,200
Like what's the Cadence of that alignment that takes place in communication and meetings because we don't want more meetings.

367
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,800
We want to work asynchronously as well.

368
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,100
But like how does that look in each of your organization's?

369
00:38:43,200 --> 00:39:01,000
I mean, I think for us, we plan we do annual plans, we revisit every half, and then we have got a pretty tight alignment on a monthly basis with our sales leadership, including at the segment level to see how is what we are.

370
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:10,900
Delivering performing so that we can iterate along the way I would say you probably can't you can over plan in this climate but you can't communicate enough.

371
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,800
Like I don't think there's such a thing as too much.

372
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,100
Munication in this climate because things are changing, its really unpredictable.

373
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:25,700
So the more conversations you can have to make sure that everybody has the same shared information on how we're performing and what's trending in the market the better.

374
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:38,700
So if you're not doing that at least monthly you know you probably need to think about increasing that frequency across sales and marketing line am curious what you all do from up from a planning and Alignment.

375
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,300
Cadence.

376
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,900
Yeah, well, our exec team, we meet for two hours.

377
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,700
Every Week.

378
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:51,600
So that's sort of standing, you know, huddle, and we cover all kinds of topics.

379
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:56,100
Obviously, you know, it's funny.

380
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,500
I wish I could give a better answer because there's a lot of things that we do.

381
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:07,200
There're meetings, that we have, there're dashboards, there's this, there's, there's Monday reports that go out.

382
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,100
I mean, we have all of those things, but I call it getting in the flow.

383
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:32,400
And Anna and it's a little more organic but I just think that there's like knowing when you're in the flow with someone and when you're not and to me like being in the flow is like the I have got 10 minutes before a flight.

384
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,900
I am just going to call you and see what's going on, you know?

385
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:56,700
And, and I know that sounds but I think sometimes we almost over engineer and then almost I don't have his real conversations, whereas, Sometimes just a little text here there or a quick, you know, 15 minute, I am waiting in carpool.

386
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,200
What's shakin bacon?

387
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
Helps with that.

388
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:01,800
I don't know.

389
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,300
Flow.

390
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:10,500
Anyway again, I don't think that's the answer people want but that's what, but I think you're hitting something Latin, especially moving into next year.

391
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,200
You know, I think what you're hitting is trust.

392
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:25,700
I think in flow can happen when you have this the trust amongst your key colleagues that you're running in the trenches with and it's like how do you get there?

393
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,000
You know if rather than falling default to our Templates.

394
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,800
And okay.

395
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:39,500
We have got this meeting, Cadence sometimes there's core things that we need to address, but it requires that level of trust and communication to get there.

396
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,400
So what have both of you done to get to flow?

397
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,100
Because I think that is a very powerful note.

398
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,600
I think sometimes like putting down the agendas in the slides like to build off that.

399
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:05,800
Like so we have pipeline meetings every month and there's the slot, you know, the dashboards and the slides and the whatever and all the Rev world leaders are there and marketing's there.

400
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:12,300
And one of our last meetings I was like, let us just I read the pre-raid, can we just like put that aside?

401
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,300
Can we just talk about what's happening in the business?

402
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,200
And like what's it?

403
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,500
And we had the conversation on what's within our control.

404
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:30,300
And so we started looking at The metrics, you're like, okay, what's within our control and it was a very helpful conversation, but we just sort of like it was sort of like just we're doing all the things.

405
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,000
Can we just pause for a minute and just have some real talk about?

406
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,300
What do you think's happening?

407
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,800
Just intuitively, we have informed ourselves.

408
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,300
What do we think is within our control?

409
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,900
So I think it's a really important thing about building trust but also trusting yourself.

410
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:50,400
There is going to be very little certainty including in all of your data in the first table.

411
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,000
Future things.

412
00:42:51,100 --> 00:43:01,600
Are going to be wonky and you're gonna be like, I don't know why top of funnel looks great, but bottom of the funnel conversions are lower and I think just trusting your own intuition and form yourself and then trust your intuition.

413
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:10,300
And have real talk with your team's is it is pretty powerful and so that's resonating what Latin he said and what you said, you know, with me as well.

414
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,100
Love that.

415
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:25,400
Okay, I am gonna pull us back up into some other questions that are popping up here and I would love to tackle customer marketing as well looking at time.

416
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,900
Alina's got a question here on okrs and structure.

417
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:38,900
So as we're talking, still about teams and how you all do things within each of your orgs, how do you structure Okie ours, specifically for your marketing team?

418
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:54,200
So I am a V2, mom Enthusiast for the record, but we also do, okay, ours and so.

419
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,200
Okay, ours to me or more bottom up.

420
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:05,200
V2, mom is more top-down and you need both, but they calf they can't connect.

421
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:24,800
And so what we do is we have the company V2, mom, that comes out at the beginning of the year and then gets a refresh, you know, in the middle of the year and then I develop off vibing off of the company, won the marketing lie to Mom.

422
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,500
For our artwork and then individuals, do okay, ours.

423
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:39,500
But I ask that the okay are has one objective, no more than 31 objective.

424
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:47,100
That's tied to the overall, the overall kind of V2, mom, marketing, and or company.

425
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:55,600
But the whatever the top priorities are from the company, s is a functional thing, something they're going to, you know, tied to their overall functional goals.

426
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,000
Then third is personal but no more than that.

427
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,900
And then we do a check in on those every quarter.

428
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,200
But I think you can kind of over do it.

429
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:16,800
If you get to I mean, so much of being a good manager, is just consistently having a one-on-one with people.

430
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,800
So we do, we do almost the exact same thing.

431
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,400
So we have the company V2, mom's published at the end of the year.

432
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,500
We do a mid-year kind of refresh of that.

433
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:36,100
Based on what's changed the market, we have a marketing one that fives off the company, one, and then for ours, we have key.

434
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,200
I have key leaders who own what's called a method.

435
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,900
So I see Spencer here sharing it.

436
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,400
So each of my L will own at least one method.

437
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And then they're accountable for the cross-functional work required to make that method, come to life and to happen and to hit the metric associated with it.

438
00:45:53,300 --> 00:46:00,700
And then we do individual V2 moms as well that we pair with what's called a performance development plan which is here's what I am going to achieve for the company.

439
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:08,100
And here's what I want to achieve in my career and sometimes those are very much correlated and sometimes the career ones are longer term, and we check it.

440
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,100
We do those quarterly as well, but they're two different documents.

441
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:22,000
One, sort of the Personally to Mom and one is the personal development plan, it's called a PDP, not to be confused with a pip which is where acronyms can go really South.

442
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:32,100
That's good clarification, awesome and thanks caver, eccentric, a break for dropping in the V2.

443
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,500
Mom framework, right there.

444
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:35,900
That's great.

445
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:48,000
Here's another question coming up about the structure of your teams and within each of your orgs is coming up from a Lena, how do you structure your team or so moving into 2023?

446
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,800
How are you looking at structuring?

447
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,100
Your team to support the goals that you have all identified?

448
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:57,500
Amanda.

449
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,900
You want to take this one for sure.

450
00:46:59,700 --> 00:46:59,900
Well.

451
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:18,700
So G to my org looks a little different, and she too because of the nature of our business, but I have kind of traditional ask structure and then I have a Brandon Communications function which is really responsible for our story but also includes things like events that really Naturally Fit within the skill.

452
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,500
Set of that team.

453
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,800
They have a creative function, which supports a lot of our organization.

454
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,900
I have product partner and Summer marketing actually together.

455
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:40,500
And that's really nice because it helps us I think tell a better narrative around our products but more importantly, even the value that we're delivering to our customers and that they're getting from the products.

456
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And then I have a, I have an interesting organ, it's our user lifecycle and Community organization, which is really focused on the buyer, side of g 2.

457
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,700
So how do we get more people coming to G2 to search for software and to leave reviews for software?

458
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,400
Providers.

459
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:05,200
And so that's a function and actually, it includes support as well, which is a bit unusual for a marketing team, and they're all focused.

460
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:11,200
We have got 80 million buyers who come to G to it and growing, and so they're a big part of that.

461
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:26,100
And then we have a revenue marketing function which is in a very important function that also includes our marketing operations and Tech stack, which is near and dear to my heart are a great team and the mar Tech stack is pretty core to everything we do at G2.

462
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,200
So, That's kind of the core functions.

463
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,300
We have it in marketing.

464
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:45,300
I would say similar, we have competitive intelligence under pmm, but customer is also under pmm and partner.

465
00:48:46,200 --> 00:49:00,200
We have a separate ABX team which for us, is just a, it's all of our experiential marketing which we do a lot of and a lot of like high-touch campaigns and things like that.

466
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,200
At, and they're their own team.

467
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,400
But other than that, yeah, I was a pretty standard.

468
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:09,700
That's great.

469
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:17,500
Well, I do want to pull the thread into customer marketing because this is a topic that has been coming up a lot.

470
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:30,300
And, you know, moving into next year investing into existing customers focusing on retention and expansion is a no-brainer and a big priority, you know, there're many ways.

471
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,600
Ways to go about to do this, aside from getting G2 reviews from customers, holding an advisory boards.

472
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,500
What does customer marketing look like?

473
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:45,100
What does that look like for each of you and where does the budget headcount come from?

474
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:51,700
Because it's not quite a fully fleshed-out, you know, maybe it is for you all, but I think I know right now.

475
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,600
There's a lot of folks still trying to figure out what does that look like?

476
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,700
What is the ROI?

477
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,900
And attribution look like with customer marketing.

478
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:00,400
Yeah.

479
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:16,600
Well, I think it starts with how do you define customer marketing and I can get on a soapbox about this but I think it's one of the most critical functions and also one of the most multi-faceted if you define it in a really strategic way which is not often defined in a very strategic way.

480
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,800
To me, it's incredibly strategic.

481
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:29,300
What you think about customer marketing is the function that both it's sort of Yin and Yang helps you grow with your existing customers and also leverages your existing customers to grow with new ones to me.

482
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,300
That becomes a really strategic function within the organization.

483
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,500
Like, it's not references and reviews.

484
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:40,800
It's actually, how do we grow our existing customer base and turn them into Advocates that can help us attract new customers?

485
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,200
That's a strategic customer marketing function.

486
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:56,900
And so for us, that's how we have defined it, and we have a couple of pillars under that are really important but one of the most important ones for us right now is customer education but for Us customer education, starts presale.

487
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:08,000
So we don't gate our customer education for like when you become a customer because we know that buyers want to understand how they're going to be successful and using the product while before the sale.

488
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:17,700
And so we spend a lot of time thinking about what's the right training and education for our customers, including presale and how do we carry that through?

489
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,600
And then certainly advocacy is the second pillar.

490
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,700
How do we actually build customer Advocates and have them?

491
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,400
Share the stories of how G2 is impacting their own?

492
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,900
And growth.

493
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,800
And then expansion is sort of the third pillar.

494
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:38,300
And how do we actually make sure we're growing our customer relationships and really strategic ways, especially for our larger accounts?

495
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:50,900
So those kind of how we have defined it, it's a really big and important function, but it can often be like, well, we have someone who does references reviews, which isn't a bad thing, you want that, but I think there's so much more to it than that.

496
00:51:53,700 --> 00:52:09,300
So we I would say one of the things that we do is customer and Community is one group, and they really go hand-in-hand, and so we very early on at six cents.

497
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:15,100
Realized we don't really sell software, we sell change.

498
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:23,600
And a change in approach that is, is more efficient and has all these great benefits, but requires a change.

499
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:28,600
And so we decided, we need to support.

500
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,700
We probably need to provide support other than just how to set it up in the software, right?

501
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:40,800
Like it's a mentality, the measurement around it, the process around it, the organizational structure.

502
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:47,100
So very early on, we decided we were going to invest be And communities.

503
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:51,100
And so, that's a huge part of our customer marketing.

504
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:55,200
It's about, you know, how do we make sure that they are engaged, right?

505
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:07,800
You think about Employee Engagement, we think about customer engagement and, you know, we measure things like, we want to make sure that ninety percent of our customers show up every quarter.

506
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:14,100
Like if no one is coming to learn about our new roadmap from an account there.

507
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,400
Probably read.

508
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:15,900
They don't.

509
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,200
Care you, right?

510
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,900
And so it's like, people vote with their feet, and so we do a lot around keeping customers engaged.

511
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,200
Keeping them, you know, we're innovating fast.

512
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,200
And so we want to, we want to also address them in their whole role.

513
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,600
Not just what they do with six Ed's, right?

514
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:40,700
So I want people to say six cents, made me successful in my role and my kpis, but also my overall career.

515
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,900
So we take, I would say a very broad approach for customers.

516
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:52,200
Getting, you know, the funding of it is, is interesting.

517
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:58,700
It's sort of like you for me, you sort of, don't ask and you just do and then it's amazing.

518
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:04,800
And of course people want to fund it but not everyone has that luxury, especially right now.

519
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,900
So I get that.

520
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:25,700
But I would say going back to some of those important metrics like nrr and gross retention and you know, No, we think a lot about adopted use cases and so, you know, how are we helping get more adopted use cases?

521
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:29,000
So that's that is like a score that we look at.

522
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,400
So yeah, it's a much more I think holistic.

523
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:41,600
It can have a lot more value than people, I think perceived in the past.

524
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,300
But it does require the right level of investment, right?

525
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:51,000
I mean, we said oh, it's It just reviews and it's not just references in case studies, but that's a lot of work.

526
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,300
Justin just that's still a lot of work.

527
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,600
It really is and I know and you know, requires investment of a different kind.

528
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,000
So yeah.

529
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:14,200
But I think again you know, when you think about the cost of losing a customer and you think about LTV and like again great SAS metrics, they come down to retention and growth.

530
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:19,000
So just making sure you're tying that function back to those.

531
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,200
Yeah.

532
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,300
And I do want to say like, The reference is a reviews, it's really the foundation.

533
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,400
Like if you don't have customers that are willing to Advocate, right?

534
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:32,300
And there's no real Community, it's going to be a community of complainers.

535
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,300
You're going to be screwed.

536
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,200
Yeah.

537
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:42,000
And it gives you those hand-raisers who you can see like are we ready to build and kind of create our own connection and who should we invite?

538
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,700
But yeah, you want to make sure you have got people who are willing to come to the dance before you put on.

539
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,100
Don't put on the party, they don't it's going to come to.

540
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,700
So those are pretty critical at the foundation of God.

541
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,400
Marketing.

542
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,400
I love that.

543
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,200
You said budget to.

544
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,100
I feel like, if you ask a CMO, what do you have?

545
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:05,000
Budgeted for Pipeline and acquisition, they will be like, I know exactly my number next year and I fought with my CFO about it and if you ask them like, what did you budget for customer marketing?

546
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:13,700
That's a much harder question but I think a really good one to ask heading into next year and just try honestly just tracking upsell pipeline.

547
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:21,600
Again, if you take this holistic pipeline model, I can flip back and forth and a second between net new and upsell pipeline.

548
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:34,200
And if we now and then going back to the financial plan, if we know that this year, we have agreed of higher percentage of our Pipeline and bookings is going to come from expansion or cross-sell.

549
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,300
Then, you know, there you go, then you sort of have your metric.

550
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,000
But anyway, so that's also another way to look at it.

551
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,000
So good I can't believe it.

552
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,800
We only have five minutes left time just flew, and we have some questions here.

553
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,500
You know, looking at all these, I would love to ask this last question.

554
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,900
I know there's some technical questions, Leo.

555
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,200
Chris you guys are asking some technical questions will reply back to you after this event.

556
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:10,400
But in this event right now as we're wrapping up, I want to bring up Christine colosimo's, question.

557
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,100
Oops, sorry Sal could actually hit the button.

558
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,200
He's our producer.

559
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:27,700
Maybe you can pull it back up, but she was asking basically how do we keep our team's motivated in times like this when budgets are smaller efficiency?

560
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,400
Super important headcount is harder to come by.

561
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,600
How are you inspiring the teams?

562
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:43,400
It's probably the thing I worry the most about And Amanda and I were at dinner last night talking about this.

563
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:54,000
Like you know a no-brainer is getting people together but that's also expensive, right, looks like, right?

564
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,300
So it's like, It's hard.

565
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:04,200
We're going to have to it's like covid part 2, right of being creative, especially with us.

566
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:19,500
You know, embracing hybrid, you know, work environments and I think that I have decided I wrote in prep for this like You know, this whole does more with less is just b*******.

567
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,200
Like that's not inspiring to anybody.

568
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:34,400
So I think what we have to do is really commit to We have to fundamentally change the way we work and that either comes from better focus.

569
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:49,200
It comes from tapping into things like, Automation and AI for scale and then I think it comes from eliminating complexity because complexity comes at a cost.

570
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:59,100
And, you know, when you're in a high growth environment, you can just add a dad and sometimes you just need to peel it back and be like, wait why are we doing that?

571
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:04,700
Like, you know, and so But it, I don't know.

572
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:10,900
I would love suggestions for what, what people think work, I mean, I can't do another virtual wine tasting.

573
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,000
I know that, you know, it's okay.

574
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,700
We had to, I mean, I don't know.

575
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,600
I think so.

576
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,500
A couple things I have three.

577
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:20,900
I don't.

578
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,400
First of all, this is a journey.

579
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,900
I think for everybody, our team included, but I think the first is people can't feel motivated.

580
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:31,800
When they don't understand and know, and trust the people they work with and you don't have to do that in person.

581
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:39,600
It helps But we just do a chat every month, and it's just, there's no agenda.

582
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,200
There is no, we did the wine tasting.

583
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:56,900
It's just like just show up, and we're going to talk, and we often have themes that are like real, and we find ways to kind of connect as people because it's hard to just be work people all the time through resumes green.

584
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:02,900
So that's the first thing is get to know each other as people, because it's, you're going to be more motivated when you're working.

585
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,500
And supporting people, you really know.

586
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:16,700
And trust the second thing we do is find the creativity in it, which is easier said than done, but there's always peopled on this like, I am one of those people that's like, who doing more or less have fun.

587
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,000
Like, I know, I am a rarity right.

588
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,700
Like, I am like, oh, that sounds really exciting, but there are ways to find the fun and creativity on it.

589
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:28,200
And so, I think just saying like what can be what if this was fun?

590
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:37,500
Like what would have to be the conditions in which this would be enjoyable for us and it might mean, I mean, what we need to do less stuff because otherwise, it's just overwhelming and can we prioritize better?

591
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,700
And it may also look like efficiency and optimization and finding new levers to pull this fun because we can test and experiment and that's fun.

592
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,500
And I think the third thing is just like being transparent.

593
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,400
It gets really hard to stay motivated if you think there's something behind the curtain.

594
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:56,900
And, so I think it's m like the more you can be just transparent on what you know and what you don't know.

595
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:02,000
Because there's a lot, we don't know and won't be I think super important.

596
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:08,300
