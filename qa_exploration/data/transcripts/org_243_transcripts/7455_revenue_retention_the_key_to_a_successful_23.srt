1
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,500
Did a full 180 crazy?

2
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:28,600
Walk away, you know how don't talk and don't you good?

3
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,800
Anything could stop me.

4
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,300
The ox and lamb kept time for the rubber bumper.

5
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:58,100
I played my drum for him but I played my best for him.

6
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,600
Hello, everyone.

7
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:52,800
It's great to be with you today, and nice to see you tuning in from all over the world.

8
00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Literally, we got folks from Puerto Rico to Colombia, to Cape Cod Seattle, and I am here in Ewa Beach Hawaii.

9
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a beautiful day to be alive today, so I am really excited about today's panel.

10
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,400
I have got some of the best customer marketers.

11
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,600
Who will be talking today about customer retention and why this is such a critical thing?

12
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,800
You know, there was a recent stat that came out from Bain & Company research that a 5% increase in customer.

13
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:36,400
Retention can actually increase profits by 25 to 95% what a mind-blowing stat right there.

14
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,600
So, especially as we're moving into 2023, we know, budgets are getting tighter, we have to be better.

15
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,000
Better stewards of the business overall.

16
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,600
It makes sense to double down.

17
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,100
And so we have got the best here and I would love to introduce to our stage.

18
00:10:51,300 --> 00:11:00,200
Nick Bennett director of evangelism and custom marketing analysis and Serena director of customer marketing at qualified.

19
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,500
Hi.

20
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,100
Hi, everyone.

21
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,900
How's it going?

22
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,800
How's it going?

23
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,800
Good to see you, both.

24
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,300
How are you doing well, doing?

25
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,600
Well, happy holidays.

26
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,600
Happy holidays.

27
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,400
So, just to get a quick check here, we're all tuning in from just want to put up this map where Serena year.

28
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,800
Okay, you're an Oakland.

29
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,600
I am an England.

30
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:29,900
Yeah.

31
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,400
Right.

32
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,600
Right.

33
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,700
Outside of San Francisco.

34
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,500
In the East Bay.

35
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,300
Nice and Nick.

36
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,200
We see your tuning in from Boston.

37
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,500
Yes, yes, it's cold like that.

38
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,500
Oh, it's freezing.

39
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,000
It's actually snowed the other day, and I was not ready for that.

40
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,500
Okay.

41
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,000
Gotcha.

42
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,700
Serena, how's the weather for you?

43
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,800
You know, it's a little warmer not snowing here but yeah, probably in the 50s.

44
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,900
So staying warm.

45
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,900
Nice.

46
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,400
Nice.

47
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,300
I can't complain.

48
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,900
It's run 70 over here.

49
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,400
So Contrast temperatures.

50
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,200
Awesome.

51
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:16,100
Well, before we kick off, you know, would love to talk just a little bit about each of you and get to know each of you a little more with our fun facts.

52
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,000
So I am going to start off with my fun fact.

53
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,000
It's not exactly me.

54
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,400
But it's my husband who actually used to do a doo-wop group with Bruno, Mars.

55
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,400
So the two in the middle right there.

56
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,500
Bruno, Mars is in the middle left.

57
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,000
And my husband Duane is to the right of him.

58
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:45,700
And this was their doo-wop group base is seeing all around the Honolulu hotels, and they say, do Ops with Boys to Men and all these other tracks.

59
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,500
But yeah, I am gonna hand it over to you, Nick.

60
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,100
What's your fun fact?

61
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:57,900
Yeah, for me it's I still play baseball competitively, so I am 35 and I can still hang with a lot of those 18 year olds.

62
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,700
Nice.

63
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,400
Where?

64
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,500
What?

65
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,200
Position.

66
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,800
Do you play?

67
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,000
I am a picture.

68
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,100
I am a lefty pitcher, and I actually come out of high school.

69
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:15,600
I used to throw almost 90 miles an hour, and I was on the way to a D1 scholarship and I blew out my arm.

70
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,800
Unfortunately.

71
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:24,000
And, so I was told I needed Tommy John surgery and for anyone that knows like, I am not going to the pros.

72
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,800
I was like, you know what, I am just ready to go to school.

73
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,700
Play some baseball with a weaker arm and get my degree and move on.

74
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:32,500
WOW.

75
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,400
Wow, didn't know you're moving towards.

76
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:35,700
Do you want?

77
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,400
And that's pretty big deal.

78
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,100
All right, handing it over to you.

79
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,900
Serena.

80
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,100
What's your fun fact?

81
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,700
So my fun fact is I am a twin I have got a twin sister named Karina.

82
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,600
Yes, those names.

83
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,500
Rhyme just closer to you and Nick she's over in New York but that's a photo of us at dreamforce.

84
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,500
We're hugging Astro, love, love me some Astro.

85
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,100
And then I think you have got another photo.

86
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:12,900
Figured I would YouTube since we're Twins and given of course this season, you have got little Serena and Karina in matching snow attire because twin parents love doing that.

87
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,200
So, yeah, speaking of twin parents got a call it out Nick, I am.

88
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Yeah, I am actually having twin girls and I already have a four-year-old daughter, so I am going to be officially really outnumbered in a couple more months.

89
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,400
So congrats.

90
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,400
Well, they have natural rhyming names.

91
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:44,600
Nick know I will, so we're at the point now where we're trying to see my daughter's name is Reese, and we're trying to say, do we do now go all our names but like, we're just like a whatever.

92
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,700
It's like at this point we're just taking it day by day.

93
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,500
That's awesome.

94
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,400
We got the twinsies connections all around here.

95
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,400
Cool.

96
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,000
Well, jump diving right into our discussion here.

97
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So, as I mentioned earlier, customer marketing is going to be a huge priority for a lot of teams, moving into 2023.

98
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,300
But there's a lot of questions still around processes and like how do you define it?

99
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:21,100
So I just wanted to hear from each of you, how do you define customer marketing and What are some of those pillar programs?

100
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:25,800
Awesome.

101
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
I will go first.

102
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,700
So, how I Define customer marketing is really understanding our customers stories, how they're leveraging our products.

103
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,300
And then, of course, how we bring those stories to life, across our different marketing channels, they think that's sort of the core of it.

104
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,100
Yeah, and I would say, for me, you know, and I am not a customer marketer per se.

105
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,000
Like, I have been doing this for like, five months, but I am a traditional field marketer and ABM marketer.

106
00:15:52,400 --> 00:16:02,000
And, so I have always understood the customer for me, the way that I view it is, how can customer marketing support retention, and for us, we call it t TV.

107
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,800
So, time to value, and the board has put so much pressure on us to deliver High retention numbers from a net revenue.

108
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,600
Tension.

109
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:22,800
And so all the focus is there right now and honestly it's been really interesting to think about it for someone that has not specifically run customer marketing programs for years.

110
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,100
And I have relied so much on the customer marketing Community to bounce ideas.

111
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,000
Off of, it's been really refreshing.

112
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:42,100
And when you each describe, like just some basic pillar programs of what can customer marketing can consist of what does that look like for qualified and Alice?

113
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:44,800
Yes, I do.

114
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,400
Oh God, go ahead make.

115
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:54,200
I was going to say, you know, so I break it down into like five buckets and so when I think about like, how can we actually support that?

116
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,700
So internal enablement, how do we enable and educate our csm's?

117
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:05,099
And so that's a big one because they're the ones that are on the front lines that are talking to the customers every day and being a failed marketer.

118
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,500
I always partnered really close with the sales team.

119
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,700
I was the closest member of marketing to the sales team and it was a very much, a two-way street so internal.

120
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:14,599
Moment.

121
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:20,400
Huge, especially when you don't have an enablement resource to when I think of like new customers again.

122
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,200
It's like how do you reduce time to Value?

123
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,000
So like for us we are gifting company.

124
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:30,400
How do we get that time for them to send their first 20 gifts within a 30-day window?

125
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:45,000
Because if you're signing a one-year contract and it's taking you three months to get out of onboarding, you really only have nine months to see value and then who knows, these things that pop up and then renewal time And it's like, well on.

126
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,500
I didn't even get as much value out of this.

127
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,400
I need longer.

128
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,600
So reducing time to value for new, customers from all customers.

129
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,300
It's how do you increase?

130
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,500
The use case adoption.

131
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,900
So for me, it's like, how do I Inspire and educate customers on how to use gifting and creative ideas?

132
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:08,800
And it's probably why I join so many calls to ideate, and there's strategize with customers and Prospects.

133
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:15,000
But the customer side, those relationships should really start at the prospect level and Then you will at risk.

134
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,600
So obviously churn is Big right now, budget concerns from a marketing perspective.

135
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,000
How can we identify customers that risks way earlier, how can we run?

136
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,500
Proactive Outreach to them and then high-performing customers on the flip side, how do you actually turn those into Advocates?

137
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:39,800
So that they are the ones that are ultimately driving a ton of inbound business, on the acquisition side, Yeah, right.

138
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,200
So I would say on the qualified side you touched on a lot of the pillar programs that we offer as well.

139
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,900
So we're thinking about website content so that's in the form of case studies.

140
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:56,400
We Do videos, we do a lot of Photography along with quotes and stats were thinking about sales enablement, constantly.

141
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:05,900
I think that's a big portion of my job as well as making sure that our reps are knowledgeable about the stories that we have and are able to communicate those stories to prospects, as well as customers.

142
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,700
So that's usually in the form of story, slides, we have quote slide It's we do slide recordings, email, templates, all of that.

143
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,300
And then I would also say social is a big channel for us.

144
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,700
We're promoting these stories, these quotes these successes on organic as well as paid.

145
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,100
And we're also doing a lot of events and webinars like this webinar.

146
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,300
But yeah, we also are just starting to kick off an MVP program.

147
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,500
So really elevating.

148
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:38,900
Those customers that are considered true Champions really making sure that they're understanding how to use the product inside and out so that we can help too.

149
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,500
Scale, our CSM team, that's great.

150
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,100
Thanks for breaking that down.

151
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:50,100
If anybody has questions, feel free to drop it in Q&A, and we will be sure to pull those up.

152
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,400
So that's really helpful to understand the breakdown of each of these pillars.

153
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:02,100
Now we talked when we think of the actual onboarding experience after the post sale with a customer.

154
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,300
What does that process look like of hand off with customer success?

155
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,800
And when Does customer marketing come in and get introduced.

156
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,700
How do they get introduced?

157
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:18,500
Like what can you walk me through that introduction point of customer marketing with the customer?

158
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,100
Yeah, no.

159
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,700
I am happy too.

160
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:31,000
So for us something that we like to do is we like to include a publicity Clause within the contract.

161
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,700
So we know right off the bat whether or not this is a customer that's open to doing co-marketing.

162
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:44,000
So I think that's a really important first step for us and then I would say just as we're signing, a customers, something that we like to do is what we call a win announcement.

163
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,200
So, you know, we have got this great customer.

164
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,600
They have decided to partner with us.

165
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,300
Let us make a big splash about that.

166
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:59,200
I think that's a really sort of nice way to start the relationship and then from there, we generally partner with customers that are seeing success.

167
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,200
So whether that's after 6 months, time frame were checking in with dark USA.

168
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,300
Team to understand which customers are seeing success, which customers are really leveraging.

169
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,700
Our platform to the Max and understanding who those true Champions are getting those introductions.

170
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:22,700
And then meeting with those customers, doing those kickoff calls, understanding their stories understanding In what marketing opportunities they're interested in.

171
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,800
I think that's a really important step as well because you want to make sure these relationships are mutually beneficial.

172
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,700
So understanding what opportunities they get excited about.

173
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,200
Whether that's speaking whether that's sharing their story in the form of a case, study or a video.

174
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,100
Those are things we like to cover.

175
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:43,700
And then of course, in that same conversation, understanding their use case and really getting into the nitty-gritty of their story.

176
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,700
And then from there, being able to leverage that content in a lot of different ways.

177
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:59,800
And do you generally meet with a customer right upon within the first 30 days of their onboarding, or what's like a good amount of time from the point of post-sale onboarding?

178
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:06,800
Yeah, I think they're interested in doing when announcements where generally getting introduced within the first 30 days.

179
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,200
But, typically, I would say it's after, after they were seeing value, so for us, that's anywhere from for six to eight months.

180
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,200
Nick.

181
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,000
Any thoughts to add?

182
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,700
So I actually report to our VP of Cs which is interesting.

183
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:39,000
So like, I actually don't report to marketing right now per se, but I am incredibly aligned to our customer success team and it's actually the team that has grown most out of any team within the last.

184
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,900
I would say six months.

185
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,300
Or so, we have actually moved a lot of people in the acquisition side over to the CSI.

186
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,600
In our account management side as well.

187
00:22:47,800 --> 00:23:02,000
And you know we so for us it's a little bit easier because we're marketing to marketers, and so we're marketing to people that are exactly like me that have been looking to solve these pain points for the last you know 10 years of my career.

188
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:08,700
So I can relate, and I am usually connected to them, or we been in different like same circles.

189
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:15,400
It's easier to have those conversations which usually for us happen even before they become a customer.

190
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:26,200
Um, because I probably talked to them at the prospect bubble, I probably sent them some type of gift made them feel kind of like, you know, vip-style specially to our Target accounts.

191
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,600
Now, it's a closed deal.

192
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,400
So again I am usually jumping on in having strategy calls around like a b x.

193
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,900
How do we like they want to go gifting in their outbound strategy for a VM?

194
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:45,400
And I talked about that, or I was actually on a call yesterday with the customer that is rolling out a brand-new customer marketing.

195
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,800
Ting program that utilizes gifting into their entire flow.

196
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And so it was more so like, hey, like how do you do this internally?

197
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And then how can I replicate that?

198
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,200
And so, it's jumping on a lot of those calls.

199
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,900
The customer stories is huge for us, as well.

200
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:10,800
I actually went through the process of redoing these, so I am calling them more playbooks now where it's a very tactical.

201
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,800
Hey you drove five hundred percent ROI increase using a How did you actually do it?

202
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,300
What are the programs you ran?

203
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,600
What are the screenshots from your dashboards?

204
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:28,100
And we get super tactical into delivering that, which not only uses us, or benefits us from a retention side for other customers.

205
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,100
It actually drives a ton of acquisition growth as well.

206
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:40,800
So we're using a kind of from both sides and for me, you don't my hundred percent of my focus isn't on customer marketing, it's also on the evangelism piece.

207
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:54,200
So I would say that there's really nice parallels between the two Lee because ultimately, you want to create your customers to be Advocates and evangelist for you out in the community and dark, social and word-of-mouth.

208
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,100
And all those beautiful things, your customers are kind of speaking about the experience that they had.

209
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,600
But yeah.

210
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:07,400
So you know, I am doing a lot of these different pieces that ultimately happen before the handoff and then through the handoff as well.

211
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,700
I feel like I have the beauty to be able to see it across the entire Journey.

212
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:12,800
Hmm.

213
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,200
What would each of you say?

214
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,600
As far as your programs that you have mapped out?

215
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:25,700
What's like the one thing that's really working right now, who I can jump in on this one.

216
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,800
So for us, it's G2 reviews, social proof is huge in.

217
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:42,100
I went through the process, I wrote a LinkedIn post about this couple months ago, but I was able to drive it was ultimately 83 reviews and like two weeks but I throw I drove 73.

218
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:49,100
In two days and it was incredible and I basically gave my playbook away for free of how I did this.

219
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,700
So, how did you do that?

220
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,300
Yeah, and it was, it was more.

221
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,300
So again it was a video in message coming from me.

222
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,800
Marketed a marketer that was talking about.

223
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:04,200
Hey listen, you're always being you know, gifted like why don't I gift you something in exchange for this?

224
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,800
Now, people are going to be like, well, listen, you're incentivizing people for review.

225
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,800
Absolutely.

226
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,900
If you're, if you're a marketer and you're not doing this, you're an Idiot.

227
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
But it's Pete.

228
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,800
You're not incentivizing people for a positive review.

229
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:27,800
You're incentivizing people for feedback and I think that's the piece that gets missed, because I got a lot of hate because people are like, you're incentivizing people.

230
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,900
Yeah, absolutely.

231
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:39,500
I want to thank someone for their time for giving feedback on how we can improve our roadmap for the future and it was honestly, one of the biggest things that we saw.

232
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:48,500
When the G2 some reports came out, We saw like number one ranking in so many reports, and it was something where I was like, cool.

233
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:57,300
I can just replicate this process now, month, over month versus waiting till the last month of the quarter when they're like, hey, you need to get all your D2 reviews in by this time.

234
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,100
And it's been a huge driver for us because then what I did was I took all those G2 reviews and I bucketed them into use cases.

235
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,200
So ABM events, customer marketing.

236
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:15,400
And I really kind of took out the gold pieces from those quotes and I fed it to the sales team to the Cs team.

237
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,900
So now they have all these use cases that they can use when they're talking to additional people as well.

238
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,600
That's awesome.

239
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,300
Serena any thoughts to the one thing that's really working?

240
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,400
Yeah, I think one thing, we're doing that's a little more out of the box is something.

241
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,100
We're calling customer appreciation day.

242
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,000
So these are days of the year that we actually bring customers into our office.

243
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
We did this during dreamforce and it worked really, really well because we had so many of those Mutual customers in San Francisco and our office just happens to be two blocks from us.

244
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,400
Coney.

245
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,400
So we were able to bring I think close to 30 customers in over the course of those three days.

246
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,200
We captured quotes from those customers.

247
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,000
During that time we captured We have them in our studio as well as video interviews.

248
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,200
And so, coming out of that, we had just all these fantastic assets.

249
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,000
We were able to repurpose and feature across our website across social many different places.

250
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And I think it was just fantastic.

251
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:17,200
Not only from the content production perspective but also being able to meet with all those customers in person.

252
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:25,100
We got to meet them build those relationships in person, we got to introduce them to folks in our office as well as our Executives.

253
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:31,500
And we Also use that day as an opportunity to host executive briefing Center beings with our Executives.

254
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
So there was a lot of excitement in the office.

255
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:41,800
There was a lot of great energy so it was just fantastic and so much so that we're now doing those on a quarterly basis.

256
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:56,200
Oh wow, whatcha do you both also have customer advisory boards and is that experience woven into an in-person experience like that or virtual experience Yes.

257
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:09,000
I would say it's something we have talked about it's not necessarily something we have done yet, something we are playing around with is something we call our early adopter program.

258
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:19,400
So that's rolling out new features to a select group of customers and having them play around with it, give us feedback that then we feed into our product team.

259
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,600
I would say, that's probably the extent of that type of strategy at this point.

260
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,100
Yeah, we're similar, we actually don't have an actually just created version.

261
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:34,000
One of like a customer Advisory Board deck for 2023 and mapped out.

262
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What that exactly.

263
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Looks like the benefits who I think should be included based on, like all of the data that we have, but we are targeting to kind of it would be a quarterly thing but it would be a virtual component in April and then in person component, in September at something yo, really bringing everyone together to do something like a really elevated experience.

264
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,900
But again, we haven't done it before and I think these customer advisory boards.

265
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:12,800
Help you become so much more proactive versus reactive when it comes to the roadmap and establishing those relationships that it's honestly, it's, I wish we did it earlier.

266
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,600
Gotcha.

267
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,100
Wow.

268
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:22,400
Okay, question, I have next is around attribution and kpis.

269
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,600
How are each of you reporting back?

270
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,000
The, the kpis what does attribution look like for customer marketing?

271
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,500
Woohoo.

272
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:41,100
Yeah it's a good question because I feel like we're still like looking at it or trying to look at it a certain way.

273
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:50,300
So we use you know, we don't really have an upsell version of our product but that is part of it, it's more influence Revenue that comes from it.

274
00:30:50,400 --> 00:31:12,000
I am more measured on like the Evangelist side as well for like you know hey self-reported attribution What specifically comes in that is mentioning my name or additional pieces that we can tie back to the efforts that I am driving on social media or in person events, or if someone comes and fills out a demo today, they say, hey, I saw you on this welcome event.

275
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Awesome, cool.

276
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:21,200
We can report that back and again that starts the relationship, ultimately, bridging out into the customer side of things but I do.

277
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,800
Look at like hey I have I wanted to get a certain number of playbooks out before the end of the year.

278
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,700
Certain number of G2 reviews, certain number of MPS surveys, things like that.

279
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:40,000
Like, you know, it's we do look at it but it's not as scrutinized as you know, some of the other roles.

280
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Yeah, I would say that's probably the piece of most customer marketing programs, that folks struggle with the attribution piece of it just because it is so difficult to sort of map out.

281
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:04,700
I would say, you know, it's next Point, there's a lot of things that were measured on in terms of output in terms of performance, you know, number of pieces of content that we produce across case, studies videos slides Etc.

282
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:10,600
But yeah, the attribution piece is less obvious and it's one that we're actually just starting to tackle.

283
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:18,400
And so what we're doing is we're starting by building out campaigns within Salesforce where then attaching those two part at retarget.

284
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:37,800
Links, I am then going to get those links into the hands of sales, so that when they do start to share case studies, slides videos with customers and Prospects that we're able to then track who's actually opening those links and who's viewing that content and then being able to Target those folks directly because we have got all that living in Salesforce.

285
00:32:38,500 --> 00:33:03,700
But yeah, beyond that I think you know the one place where we Really start to get some, some good progress there was that Salesforce and what sort of model we set up was you know if there was an introduction that was made through someone within customer marketing where we got connected to a customer and then you know, as a result of them attending an event or you know, doing some type of co-marketing with us, you know?

286
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:12,100
We could say okay great that was a relationship that marketing had started and if they were attached to a future opportunity than that was something we could.

287
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Claim credit for.

288
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,200
But I would say that was sort of the one place where we had a pretty strong model in place.

289
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,900
Now, as far as pipeline influence or anything that, you know, you currently are seeing.

290
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:43,100
Like Nick, I have heard you talk about the significant pipeline influence that even your evangelist evangelism side has had, could you each of you speak to just how the performance is as far as just from an influence standpoint for each of your Despite efforts?

291
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,100
Yeah, I can kick things off so it's, you know.

292
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
So again, self-reported attribution.

293
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,100
So we make it a required field.

294
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,700
When you fill out our demo for movies movie, made that switch back in October of 2021.

295
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Insights that we got into, which communities, we should be partnering with which channels are actually working organic was actually our biggest driver of all pipeline in 2022.

296
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,199
It's by a staggering number and marketing actually.

297
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:18,400
70% of the pipeline right now for what we have done through November of 2022.

298
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:29,699
Now, you know, when I use self-reported attribution and people specifically call out my name, I pull, I have a report in Salesforce that I can pull and kind of get this info, and so I will do.

299
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:38,699
I am on track to do a million dollars in pipeline myself this year, with about a 60 maybe a little bit higher than 60% close rate on top of that.

300
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,199
So just think about that one person.

301
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:43,400
And it's why I think that at the Creator economy.

302
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:49,500
As we move into 2023, it's going to be so crucial because ultimately we know people buy from people.

303
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:57,300
And if you can be a relatable person, someone that people want to build relationships with and get in, you provide value through the content that you create.

304
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:05,900
They may not have a need right now, but I can guarantee you when there is a need, they're going to remember you and they're gonna be like, hey, I am gonna at least put you in the conversation.

305
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,700
Then it's up to the sales team and product and all those other things to make it happen.

306
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,400
But it's about being That conversation to just get there because again, like Mar Tech.

307
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,900
It's so crowded right now in sales Tech as well and budgets are being cut.

308
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,800
Layoffs are happening every single day.

309
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,900
Why should someone say I am going to spend 20,000 dollars on Alice when I could go by Amazon gift cards off?

310
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,300
Amazon, just send it to people?

311
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,700
Like, why do I need a platform?

312
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:40,700
And so again, it's building those relationships, both virtually in person through content.

313
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,000
And again, I create intent on a lot of different platforms through events to podcast.

314
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:55,100
I just released my first episode of my new podcast today, that is a marketing podcast and so all these channels will amplify everything else that we're running internally as well.

315
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,400
So that's just kind of some thoughts.

316
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:06,200
I have the I think it's going to be, I think short form content is going to be huge in 2023 and then the Creator economy and B2B is going to be another thing.

317
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,200
Great points Bill and Chad is asking for your link to your podcast.

318
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:21,300
So please drop that when you get a moment Serena handing it over to you, any thoughts?

319
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,500
Yeah.

320
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,300
So I think it's really taking advantage of those opportunities when we meet with our customers.

321
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,500
So when we're bringing them into the office, and we're doing those customer appreciation days.

322
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,600
You know, they also have the opportunity to meet with our product team.

323
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:41,200
And so we have had a number of those conversations happen in person where they're actually getting Live demos of different products they haven't seen before.

324
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,300
And, so I think that's really been a great way to spike that interest.

325
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:52,000
Also, I mentioned the edc's, it's another opportunity to kind of understand like where the gaps are within the different products.

326
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,400
They're leveraging on our platform and then getting them into a room to actually speak with the products, you would be Executives and help them paint that vision and get those demos.

327
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,600
So, so powerful and then I think also, another great opportunity is dreamforce.

328
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,200
You know, we were sponsors this year.

329
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,900
We had sessions, we had a Both within the campground.

330
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,100
And so again, when we're able to just meet with those people in person and really show them how it works.

331
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,400
I think that's really the eye-opening piece of it.

332
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:34,100
And of course, in each of those sessions, we had our customers, tell their stories, you know, shared the stage with our speakers and it was just fantastic because you know, I think it's one thing when qualified says we're able to do something, but when you hear it from the mouth of our customers, it's so much more meaningful.

333
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,700
So we found those strategies to work very well.

334
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,800
Common denominators, I am hearing from both of you.

335
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:49,200
Is just the value of the relationship building opportunities that you're having as we're moving into this Creator economy with short-form content bite-sized.

336
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,300
So on so forth.

337
00:37:50,400 --> 00:38:04,700
What's going to sustain and keep bringing people back to your brand, is ultimately that relationship and Richard, you're calling it right here in chat where it's the reinforcement of the importance of brand relationships on sales and marketing.

338
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,500
So I think each of you guys are describing that going into Q&A, here we go.

339
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:15,500
Some questions trickling in Norma Hogan, is asking, Nick said he's under CS.

340
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,100
What about Serena is this a marketing role or a cs1?

341
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,800
Good question, a great question, I would say, you know, having done customer marketing at 5 plus companies.

342
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,600
Now generally sits under product marketing and when you think about that, it makes a lot of sense.

343
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:38,500
You know, you want your customer marketer to be able to understand the product to help customers explain the product in a way that's meaningful.

344
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,800
All that inspires others.

345
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,600
And so yeah it's typically been product marketing for me.

346
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
Yeah, I was I was going to add something to that.

347
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,200
So you know we actually just went through a reorg probably about a month or so ago.

348
00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:06,900
So I actually did sit under our VP of marketing but it's now got shifted, where some of the members of marketing that are left report to our VP of sales and growth or revenue or whatever, they're calling it now.

349
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:15,000
And then I because I am so focused on retention so under the VP of Cs but it was under marketing as well before.

350
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,900
Uh, so I just wanted to call that out.

351
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:26,700
Alright, another question here from Andrea do either of you have customer events planned in 2023 in person?

352
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:33,800
Roundtables product, service training series, customer appreciation dinners, Yes, 100%.

353
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,400
We have got incredible events, team.

354
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,100
Shout out to Jackie and Amy.

355
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,900
They're fantastic.

356
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,300
We just given our customer base and our product.

357
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,100
We partner very closely with the Salesforce events.

358
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,400
So, we're at dreamforce.

359
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,200
We're at the world tours, you will find us there.

360
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,900
And with each of those events were doing dinners the night before typically before the event.

361
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:01,200
And we're inviting, you know, key prospects and customers to those dinners to meet in person to be able to have Roundtable.

362
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,300
Shins around product and challenges.

363
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,900
They're seeing out there that hopefully we can help address.

364
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,900
So that's one thing we're doing.

365
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,500
We also have a series called Taste of qualified where we invite prospects and customers virtually to join us for wine.

366
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,500
Tasting, will usually have a featured winery.

367
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,100
That's pouring, the wine.

368
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,500
And we have shipped them, the wine in advance.

369
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,000
That's a lot of fun as well.

370
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:30,100
I would say, that's more on the event side and then, of course, the events that I am running from the, the customer marketing side is those customer appreciation days.

371
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:43,700
We talked about We're also just kicking off our MVP programs, so we will be going quarterly to meet with those MVPs in person, we have identified the top cities, they're based in, so we will be hosting those in person.

372
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,800
Meetups to do some product education, as well as some customer marketing.

373
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:57,900
So we will be doing photography, photography video, as well as interviews and two out of four of those events are aligned with Salesforce events Amazing.

374
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Yeah, any thoughts Nick to add?

375
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,800
Yeah, I mean we definitely plan to do some things.

376
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,300
We are very limited team right now with four people down from 10.

377
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:16,600
So we're cutting back on a lot of our efforts mostly from a like bigger event standpoint.

378
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:37,600
However, I am a big believer in small curated elevated experiences, both VIP experiences for your customers but also from The prospect level because I think that the amount of micro content short-form content that you can ultimately create from that and repurposing redistribute at scale is incredibly important.

379
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,600
So it's something that I definitely plan to do it.

380
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,300
Just it's going to be a lot less than what we initially expected.

381
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,000
And that's real.

382
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,800
It's probably real for a lot of companies right now.

383
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,600
So I appreciate both perspectives there.

384
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,400
Richard has a question for us.

385
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:05,000
The number one, Pitfall you see in today's customer marketing World, whether that is over or under prioritizing certain initiatives and ideas.

386
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:17,900
Yeah, I mean, I feel like it's for us like we're trying to do less honestly, it's tough when you are a Very stretched team.

387
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,200
Why do 10 different things?

388
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,900
Like, there's like 10 15, 20 different things.

389
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:28,800
I want to do, but they're going to be half asked if I do them because we don't have the resources to be able to support that.

390
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,800
So, why not do 567 things?

391
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:46,500
Really, really well, and be proud of that, and so I think for me like I am okay with doing less and it sounds weird saying that because like I am not usually that type of person, but I think the quality over quantity.

392
00:42:46,700 --> 00:43:03,100
A station starts to come in and it becomes a lot more imperative to be like, listen, I did these six things but honestly, they drove tons of business, tons of renewals early, renewals all these things and you feel really proud of it versus saying, I did these 15 different things and seven of them flopped.

393
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,200
So that's just a couple of my thoughts.

394
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:14,500
Yeah, I would say for me it's you know now that we have got sort of this content engine built, we were pumping out case studies were pumping out videos.

395
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:22,900
I really want to start focusing on the next phase of that so it's focusing on how sales is actually using the content is that's making a difference.

396
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,500
I want you know, we talked about attribution that's something I really want to figure out next year.

397
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,900
And so, for me, something I am starting to do is actually go into Salesforce.

398
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,900
We're running reports.

399
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:43,700
We're seeing all the opportunities in stage 3 looking at The notes within those opportunities and actually proactively suggesting case studies, and slides, that they should be leveraging those conversations.

400
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,300
So that's sort of something I hadn't had the time to do before that.

401
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,600
Something I want to focus on more now and moving forward.

402
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,500
And then again, yeah.

403
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,400
Figuring out, you know, how are these stories traveling?

404
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,900
Which stories are working?

405
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,700
Well, how do we produce more stories like that?

406
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,500
You know what, what are we missing as far as our inventory of stories?

407
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,600
I want to start diving more into those numbers.

408
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,900
You know I know Top my head, there's certain sub industries that we don't have as much representation as we should.

409
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,700
So that's something else.

410
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:20,200
I want to get my hands around as well as you know any stories were missing in terms of product so you know we just launched qualified meetings.

411
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:27,200
So that's something I want to be focused on is getting those stories of customers that are successfully using that piece of our product.

412
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,200
So good, thanks for sharing Bill's.

413
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,600
Got a question here.

414
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,300
Nick.

415
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,300
It sounds like you're generating a lot of content across.

416
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,900
A lot of channels though.

417
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,300
You did mention Focus right now, which is great?

418
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,100
What have you found?

419
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,200
Most effective?

420
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,400
What do you think will be effective even if it's not yet, driving metrics?

421
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,600
Yeah, I mean, for me, LinkedIn is my number one channel so, and I was able to fortunately build up a pretty decent sized audience there.

422
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:10,500
I have almost 42 thousand followers currently And, so I have been able to initially I Niche down really, really hard on field marketing at the start of the pandemic and it was I was the only one talking about it on all of LinkedIn.

423
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:19,400
Like how does it actually contribute to a revenue organization and so people were interested in that and then I branched out to ABM then I branched out to a lot of different topics.

424
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,400
And now more recently, I am talking about like, the customer marketing piece in its.

425
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,600
It's honestly, it's been really, really great.

426
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:37,100
And if you look at the content that I create, I actually Talk about Alice in 98% of that content and Leadership internally isn't happy about that, by the way.

427
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:52,000
But I think it's important because if I know that for 2022, I am going to drive about 15 to 20 million views on my content alone, organically on LinkedIn, think about how many people are clicking my profile.

428
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
So you know on LinkedIn where it says, every 90 days you can see how many people click your profile.

429
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,900
So I have about 15,000 people that view my profile.

430
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,800
Every 90 days on a rolling thing.

431
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,700
So the first thing that they do when they cook their profile, my profile is they see.

432
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:05,700
Oh cool.

433
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,600
He's at Alice.

434
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:07,700
Oh, what's a Liz?

435
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,700
Oh, they're gifting platform.

436
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,000
Oh, we use a competitor.

437
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,700
Oh, oh, we're thinking of budgeting for that, for 2023, they click it.

438
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:23,600
That's where the self-reported attribution standpoint comes in and all I am trying to do is share learnings of things that I am working on different types of projects like nothing is off limits for me.

439
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:29,100
And again, it's probably something that leadership isn't always happy about but I don't share anything that's negative.

440
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,300
You know numbers that I shouldn't be.

441
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:39,400
I just share projects that I am working on lessons, learn successes failures because people don't like to talk about failures because they feel judge.

442
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:45,500
I will talk about failures all day long because it's about the learnings that you do from those failures to move you forward.

443
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,700
And that's all I have really tried to do.

444
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:57,000
It's been in March of twenty 20, 30 be three years of me, creating content on LinkedIn, and so I have now doubled down on Tick, Tock and Instagram rails.

445
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And all I am doing is taking my written LinkedIn content and recording myself on video talking about what that text post was, and then Distributing it on, you know, YouTube shorts, rails, and Tick-Tock.

446
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,600
So it actually doesn't take me a ton of time to get this content out there.

447
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:19,200
It's more time, actually engaging in replying to every single person that comments on my stuff.

448
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,300
But that's how you build those real relationships.

449
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:31,600
That's how you get in those conversations when someone's thinking about your product, or service, or whatever it is, it's the relationships that you build in the Mint section that ultimately moved to DMS.

450
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,600
Ultimately move to inbound.

451
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:40,100
Requests ultimately remove the comes to like job offers down the road as well.

452
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:49,500
Like it can do a lot from you from a branding perspective in like building an audience, but you have to deliver value versus being that person that just is out there, pitching their company every day.

453
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,300
Such good, call-outs, tons of gems.

454
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:56,700
There.

455
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,200
I am curious are both of you?

456
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:08,400
So you mentioned, Nick, you're using Tick-Tock and these other social channels for customer marketing and other things.

457
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,500
Serena are you finding that successful as well wear for qualified?

458
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,800
Are you all exploring other social channels is linked in a good channel for qualified?

459
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,400
Yeah, so I would say LinkedIn is definitely our number one.

460
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:22,900
Channel.

461
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,800
And we're thinking about paid and organic.

462
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:48,700
And what we do is we will always promote our stories as well as our videos customer content on LinkedIn and will encourage our customers to do the same because, of course, we have got our audience, they have got theirs and so if we're able to package that up for them, they were able to share out on their channels and even you know within the folks then the story if they share out, you know, that's just amplifying the story.

463
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,200
So I would say that's definitely our number one channel.

464
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,300
That's great.

465
00:48:53,300 --> 00:49:01,300
So you all actually create the customer testimonial and then you quip your customer with that content with the asset so that they can amplify.

466
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,200
Exactly.

467
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,600
It's a great tactic.

468
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,500
Okay, awesome.

469
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:12,700
Well, I have got one other question here, and then we can start wrapping this up.

470
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:17,300
If anybody has any other questions, please drop them in the tab.

471
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:24,400
One question I have got is around just budget and headcount for customer marketing.

472
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,700
How do you justify the budget?

473
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:33,800
The head counts if you want to do a campaign or some sort of program that requires a budget.

474
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,400
How do you justify this?

475
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,400
Maybe this is tied to that attribution.

476
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,300
Note that we talked about earlier but just curious how it works for you all.

477
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:56,400
Yeah, I think the budget conversation aligns with the strategies, so it's kind of going into each quarter and understanding like what programs do we think need to be a priority this quarter?

478
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,100
What have we noticed?

479
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,100
That moves the needle from the previous quarter.

480
00:49:59,200 --> 00:49:59,700
What do we think?

481
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,600
We have done enough of that?

482
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:05,600
We can kind of put a pause on and then, of course, understanding all the numbers that align to them.

483
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:16,800
So for me, a big Focus for us this year was producing content, so we made the budget ask for Like building out our own Studio within our obvious.

484
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,900
So, we got a lot of photography equipment.

485
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,300
We got a lot of video equipment, but being able to set all of that up.

486
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:28,100
We have now hosted three photo shoots, and we have captured 50 plus customers.

487
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,100
So I think for us that's been a huge win.

488
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,900
A lot of people might be thinking, well, you know, she's mentioned photography a lot.

489
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,200
You know, why is that so important for us?

490
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,800
If you go on our website, you're not going to see stock photography.

491
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,900
You're going to see beautiful smiling.

492
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,500
Happy customers and those are real.

493
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:52,000
Real people, real stats, real quotes, real videos, and I think that's just so much more meaningful, it's so much more authentic.

494
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,200
And I think that's made a really, really big difference for us.

495
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,800
So, yeah, I think it's just really trying to get your hands around.

496
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,600
Like, what is going to be the priority figuring out what those numbers look like and then making the case for it.

497
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,200
So that's been my Approach.

498
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,100
Yeah, I love, I love that.

499
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:34,200
That idea, honestly, we don't have it on office unfortunately anymore, but like, I would absolutely like, if anyone that's listening, like, go steal that idea because like, I have also thought about that, and because we do use stock images on her website, but like it's such a brilliant idea and I love that and I will always remember that now.

500
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,000
But for me, like, I am a one-person team.

501
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,500
Like, again, we are like super like strap.

502
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:55,900
From a budget standpoint from a resource standpoint to like usually what I have to do is provide kind of like a business justification for what I am looking to do, and I am usually borrowing money honestly from our acquisition, acquisition side of the business.

503
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:04,700
So like maybe I am taking some from Paid search or yo are paid spend or maybe I am taking it from our event budget.

504
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,400
It's been up until I switched over to the customer marketing side.

505
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,800
We actually didn't have anyone in cusp of marketing.

506
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,500
Everyone was focused solely on acquisition up until like I would say like five or six months ago.

507
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:27,600
So it's also you know I think 2023 will change it will have its own budget line item and thing but for this year I have just been like stealing from people left and right when I need money.

508
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:44,300
Love about those notes and just the realistic also situation Nick that you're communicating because I think that's something you know it's like what can we do when you have a budget when you don't have budget, you got to get really creative right?

509
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,300
So I appreciate that a ton.

510
00:52:47,200 --> 00:53:03,300
All right, well we're going to be wrapping up here and I would love to end with just a note of any advice or encouragement that you have for all of Us as we're going into 2023, we're going to get into the holidays.

511
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,800
What's something that each of you would leave with us?

512
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:17,600
I would say double down on content creation, like with your customers with, with anyone.

513
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,800
Like I think that.

514
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,400
Yo and I qualified like does a fantastic job with this?

515
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:31,400
Because again, like I see them everywhere, I see the content that they create everywhere, I spoke at their event, you know, not too long ago, Aunt insulin on content.

516
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:31,800
Yeah.

517
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:47,700
So like I think, I think if anything like, you know, figure out how to create content, whether it's through customer stories, whether it's do organic, Nick paid whatever like utilize all these things and then double down on like the short form aspect of it and then like figure out how to distribute that at scale.

518
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,900
Yeah, that's really good.

519
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,400
I think something having done customer marketing for a while.

520
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:02,300
Now that I am constantly challenging myself to think about is, how do we do it different, you know, there's, we're so used to seeing case studies.

521
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:13,400
We're so used to videos, you know, and all those things sort of the standard pillars, which aren't bad, they're fantastic, but I want to spend more time next year, thinking about like, what is that?

522
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:18,100
Next big idea that we can offer our customers, that gets them really, really excited.

523
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,800
So, We have got some ideas, we have been throwing around internally, you know, customer appreciation day was one of them.

524
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:34,100
Revamping our customer page is going to be one of them, but, you know, now that we have got all this great content, you know, can we put it in the form of this incredible customer campaign that we do next year in?

525
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,700
Does that look like out-of-home?

526
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,100
Does that look like an event presence?

527
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:47,000
Does that look like a customer only event where, you know, to your point, Nick, your stories aren't talking about your product but it's, you know, could be just the customer sharing their stories.

528
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,800
So giving them the ability in the For me to do that.

529
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,300
I think would be really exciting.

530
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,100
So that will be a challenge I take on for next year.

531
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,200
So good.

532
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,700
Wow, thank you so much.

539
