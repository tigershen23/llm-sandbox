00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:22,500
He's got a lot of deep knowledge and experience in B2B marketing and leading remote teams.

27
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,900
And today we're going to dive into a very great tap topic as it relates to going into 2023.

28
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:41,600
A lot of teams need to be thinking about their brand and on the flip side of that building healthy phenomenal, remote team culture, they go hand-in-hand, is brand ties to your values, your vision.

29
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,200
Your mission and how that gets communicated externally and internally.

30
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,200
So, with that, I would love to invite Kevin to the stage.

31
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Hello.

32
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,000

00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,300
So good to be here.

34
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,100
Thanks for having me.

35
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,300
Oh, yeah.

36
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,100
It's a pleasure to have you here.

37
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,700
Kevin.

38
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,900
I am such a big fan of you, and just everything that you have invested into the B2B marketing Community.

39
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,600
You have got a quite, you got quite a following, and you have your own news.

40
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,500
Newsletter.

41
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,900
How long have you been maintaining your own database of marketers?

42
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,500
Yeah, it's interesting.

43
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:32,000
So I number all my newsletters, I think this week's, I said, when every week this week's is 350 or something, which is not to say I have sent 350 of them, but I put the year number at the start and then number each week.

44
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,500
And so this is my third year, on some stuck, the 50th week of the year.

45
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,900
So three or sometimes doctor I have been doing it a bit before then too.

46
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,500
Wow, God Gotcha and there's such Rich information in there.

47
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,600
If people wanted to check it out.

48
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,300
What's the website link again?

49
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:57,100
Yes, he can get there through my personal website, which is Kevin Lee.com and then the direct subject link is Kevin Lee dotsub stack.

50
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,600
That qasim okay?

51
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,900
Yeah, definitely check it out, if you're interested.

52
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,200
So you're tuning in from Boise Idaho.

53
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,800
I know there's some fun facts that we want to learn to get to know you a little bit more.

54
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,700
So I put together this little pole and basically it's three truths and One Lie.

55
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,900
So if we could Pull that pull up on stage here.

56
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:34,200
Okay, so we have got these four different answers which of these is not true about Kevin one teaches marketing at a college to be a newspaper.

57
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,600
Reporter reads three reads 50 to 100 books each year or for has an MBA.

58
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,900
So go ahead and drop your votes.

59
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,100
And then we will see which one is not true.

60
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,800
Okay, I tried to vote myself.

61
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,300
This is, these are good.

62
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,800
I don't think people believe that you actually could potentially Read 50 to 100 books each year.

63
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,700
That's a lot.

64
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,600
That is a lot.

65
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,400
It's a lot bigger.

66
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,100
Alright though.

67
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,900
So yeah.

68
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,400
Okay.

69
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:18,400
So let us reveal the answer drumroll and the answer Kevin which one of these is not true.

70
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,900
I do not have an MBA, okay.

71
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,100
So you actually read 50 to 100 books.

72
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,000
Each year I do.

73
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,900
Yeah, I was lucky when I worked at buffer which is a B2B SAS social media company.

74
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:44,000
One of our perks was a free Kindle and as many Kindle books as you wanted and so that got me hooked into reading and I have carried that habit with me ever since.

75
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,900
So yeah, I read a mix.

76
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:53,500
I try to read short one so that I can get the number up and feel good about like hitting a milestone, but that is the range I try for each year.

77
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
That's awesome.

78
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:03,200
So what are some of your more recent books that you are reading and that you would recommend?

79
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,500
Yeah.

80
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,400
So I just published my best of books to my newsletter list for like the full.

81
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:16,400
I think it was 50 or 60 this year that I read and I didn't read by many marketing books this year which I don't know if that's like what that means.

82
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,600
Maybe I am burnt out on marketing books or something like that.

83
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,800
But the one that I love this year that was somewhat marketing related was called the sea.

84
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,700
We In.

85
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:34,000
It was all about storytelling and the importance of Storytelling for Branding, for marketing, for politics, for culture, like for so many different reasons.

86
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,900
And so you probably wouldn't find it in the business section of a Barnes Noble or library.

87
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,800
But for me, it had a lot of interesting takeaways from marketing.

88
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,400
And then one of my favorite marketing books of all time is a book called Alchemy.

89
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,900
It's written by one of the executives at the Ogilvy advertising agency.

90
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:02,900
It is just such a mind-blowing blend of science and art within marketing which I believe there is both a lot of science.

91
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,400
But also a lot of art that you can't really explain with what we do on marketing side.

92
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,900
And so that's been a really influential book for me, and put words to a lot of the feelings that I had with how I go about marketing.

93
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,700
Love that.

94
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,900
That's a classic right there, agreed.

95
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,400
Yes.

96
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,800
Wow.

97
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,500
Okay.

98
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:31,900
Well, thank you for sharing that and you know, I wanted to dive a little bit more into, just your story getting into B2B marketing.

99
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,400
And why, how did you get into it?

100
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,900
And why did you choose B to B?

101
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,200
Because you probably could go beat his see, as well, you know?

102
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,900
So why B to B Tech totally?

103
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,100
Well, I kind of stumbled into it.

104
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:48,900
I don't even know if I consciously like knew what B2B stood for when I started like down this.

105
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,400
And so, for me, it was wanting to join, wanted to join.

106
00:13:53,400 --> 00:14:06,800
A start-up, was one of my primary motivations and even the reason for joining a start-up was because I had a really high belief in remote work and the ability to like, do work that you're passionate about and like results-based.

107
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:18,500
Work environments, I came from a very traditional marketing background with, you know, office and suit and tie and show up to work every day and sit in meetings, and it was just like a very stereotypical experience.

108
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,100
I thought But I want something different.

109
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,500
So that led me toward toy startups.

110
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
I love the optimism of startups.

111
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:35,400
I love the scale of startups but I had no concept of what the difference between B2B and b2c was, which is maybe can partially explain how I do marketing today in some ways?

112
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:50,500
So the company that really caught my eye was buffer, which was a company that was mission first, really cared about culture and values and that was all I needed to hear like they had a An opening for writer.

113
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:58,300
And I was brought up into in newspaper, reporting and journalism and all these different written communication fields.

114
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:05,200
And so, I was like, I would love to write for a full-time job, and I want to do it at a place that cares, as much as I do about culture and values.

115
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,400
That was my start buffer happened to be a B2B company.

116
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,500
And so gained a lot of experience there.

117
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,400
And I haven't looked back since Wow, that's awesome.

118
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,300
How many years ago was that?

119
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,100
That was about ten years ago.

120
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:30,300
Guy trans I had some exposure into like New Media and startups before that through my time at vaux and that was eye-opening as well.

121
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,700
Now that was I was there for five years of as well.

122
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,100
So like 15 years total in Canada, startup and texting.

123
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,600
Wow.

124
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:56,100
Okay so tell us a little bit about like what were some of the most challenging the moments that you experienced in your startup, especially the early stages of just, like, learning about what is B2B and you know, what were some of those challenges Yeah.

125
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:06,100
Yeah, it was interesting because I think I because I don't have an MBA as we learned in the poll earlier, and I am not formally trained and educated in marketing.

126
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:15,800
So much of the marketing that I knew was either from my core discipline of content or was from the marketing that I experienced when Brands and products are being marketed to me.

127
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:27,100
And so, I think I have always had some of that like user first DNA, into my B2B marketing plans like b2c DNA Within The world that B2B marketing.

128
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,900
It's that was really helpful.

129
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:44,700
I think as a starting foundations like how would I like to be marketed to let me make sure that is true of the marketing that I do and then my team is doing so that was I think a useful Foundation to start from, but then like my education and to B2B marketing was it was like super steep.

130
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,200
Like I woke up every day at work thinking, today was going to be the work that I did.

131
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,100
Today would be the day.

132
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,100
I get found out is an impostor and I don't know anything about what I am doing, and I am sent packing.

133
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:01,100
You're thinking, so there was always that like, underlying fear of, I am not qualified or not cut out for this.

134
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:07,599
And so that motivated me to stay curious to learn as fast as I could.

135
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:20,000
The, the things that I had gaps in and to be very self-aware of where I knew, I didn't like understand the certain acronym in a meeting or understand certain phrase like rather than try to avoid like ever being close to that phrase again.

136
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,500
Like I would go out and research it understands what am I missing here was the context?

137
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,099
And so I think that Like early days.

138
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,100
I know my curiosity and my drive to succeed.

139
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,800
We're really important in learning as fast as I could.

140
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,900
I was really fortunate to be at a place like buffer, that was like, very transparent in the information that they shared internally.

141
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,700
I had a wonderful boss who was patient with me and, you know, showed me kind of the ropes of what we were doing.

142
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:52,000
And then a company, that was okay, thinking differently about how we could grow and how we want to show up as a business in the market.

143
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,100
And, so I think a lot of it was very serendipitous.

144
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,600
That I started where I did.

145
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,400
That's awesome.

146
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,200
I think all those feelings and emotions learning curves that you mentioned are so real.

147
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,900
And I think so often, you know, especially B2B marketers, just getting into the game.

148
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:20,100
I appreciate your transparency about that process because I think a lot of marketers could feel the way that what you conveyed and learned through.

149
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,200
So yeah, they're not alone.

150
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:27,800
It is a universal feeling in a lot of ways and it's a very isolating job to because like I work, Work.

151
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:33,300
I work remotely and so these things, I am feeling them in my office here.

152
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:41,300
I am not feeling the next to someone at also having those feelings and it's just a it's a feeling that you need to say out loud as much as possible.

153
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,900
So that people know, it's true of other people than just yourself.

154
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,800
Are there communities that you have joined?

155
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,200
I mean, you have created your own.

156
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,500
Are there others that you participate in as well?

157
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:06,200
Yeah, I think that's partially what motivates me to run the newsletter that I run into the present where I am present online, as a way to give back as a way to show folks.

158
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,600
Like I didn't I don't really know much about anything, but this is what I do know.

159
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,700
And if it's helpful for you, like, please, please take it.

160
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,700
So that's yeah, that's been helpful for me.

161
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,000
There have been some slack communities.

162
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,400
I have been part of Those tend to come and go.

163
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:37,700
But it's always nice to just, I tend to be more of a lurker than a valuable contributor but just being able to lurk and see the same of the conversations in there are similar to the things that I am thinking about and wondering about it makes me feel more connected, I guess to the broader marketing community.

164
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:48,800
And then I took some courses early on like reforge is one of my favorite, my favorite programs and that was really helpful to understand like oh I now know.

165
00:19:49,100 --> 00:20:01,700
Like what, the, what the current way of thinking is, and it's not very far off from how I am thinking today, or it was far off, but now I am caught up to where it was, so it was just like a very validating experience and so kind of build some of that into my, my ritual has been helpful.

166
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:24,300
Love that thank you for sharing, so I would like it out Dives Right into our panel or panels are interviewed topic here on brand strategy and how that goes hand in hand, really with the remote team culture, that you are building and you have established.

167
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,100
So, let us start with the brand strategy topic.

168
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,500
I know that you're very well versed in experienced in this area.

169
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,500
You have built differentiating brands in Tech yourself, just curious.

170
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,800
But what brands do you admire, and why?

171
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,900
Yeah, I love b2c brands in general.

172
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:55,100
And so like I am very drawn to, you know, from some really big Brands like Nike to even like the deed is see direct to Consumer space.

173
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:09,200
Like there's so many unique and interesting things happening there, in terms of how they're using storytelling and data to really connect with the very A very late clear picture of who their customer is.

174
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:16,400
I think that's what strikes me about some of the brands that I find appealing as like they are speaking.

175
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:44,700
Such a very clear and direct way to a very clear and direct type of person I think that's really admirable and something that I am always striving to do better at, and so I often look outside of tech for inspiration in that regard but when I do like inside of teca, there're things, you know, endless examples of great Brands and Tech to some of the big ones that I have, as kind of North Stars for me, and my teams are Brands like web flow or figma.

176
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:58,200
But then there's also like really, you know, early stage startups, a seed stage or series either doing some cool things to, as I am always on product hunt to understand like what is, what is the newest and greatest like tool and Technology.

177
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,000
But also how are these tools and Technologies branding themselves, and how they show up in the market?

178
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,500
So that's may be cheating.

179
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
I think I said I Find inspiration everywhere.

180
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:14,100
Essentially, but I, those are where I start when I am looking for, what makes those Brands differentiating to you?

181
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,500
Why are they iconic?

182
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:43,900
Yeah, you know, it's I think of brand as a sum of all the experiences that someone has with your company and so what differentiates them are makes them, iconic is It will sound like beating around the bush with my answer, but I think what's true for me is that it's the experience of these brands that resonates most with me and then experience is hard to like, pinpoint in 2000.

183
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:53,600
It is this exact thing they're doing with their visual identity, like I am over when, when Pitch came out as like this new slide presentation software, like they were using.

184
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,000
What was it?

185
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,800
Like 3D shapes or something, and their visual identity, which is very new and differentiated But that alone wouldn't have really sunk in with me.

186
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:10,900
Like it had to be grounded in a brand strategy and a brand personality and to permeate everything else that pitch does which they do really well.

187
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,700
So that's what draws me, more to a brand, like pitch, its kind of the sum of all the experiences.

188
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:28,600
But usually, the entry point is something may be small in particular, like a visual identity, some copy on a website, maybe some user-generated content, or Word of Mouth that people are talking about this.

189
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
And or the space.

190
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,200
So that's usually like the hook.

191
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,700
And then to really resonate with me, it needs to be like a full, a fully-realized experience.

192
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:37,900
Mmm.

193
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,400
And that takes time to be able to get there and resources.

194
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,200
Yes, it's a big Endeavor, you sure?

195
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,400
Yeah.

196
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:53,700
Because it's not, it's probably not even just marketing building out that experience.

197
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,900
It's with the product.

198
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:06,800
It's with the sales, cuz it's the whole company being Be able to adopt and fully capture the brand experience from your perspective.

199
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:14,300
Like, what has that look like with some of the brands that you have built when you have worked with other team members?

200
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,200
And how do you get that established brand strategy?

201
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,800
And then the alignment across from executive leadership to the org?

202
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,700
Yeah, you're exactly right.

203
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,200
It really is.

204
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,000
Those two phases.

205
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,200
Its can we align on?

206
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,500
What our brand is, what we stand for, how we want to show up in the world.

207
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,800
And then it's the second phase of how consistent are we being in actually following through on this and applying it.

208
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,300
So, you know, they're both very difficult phases.

209
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,400
They're different difficult for different reasons.

210
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:49,000
I think the first phase of defining that brand is needs to be highly collaborative.

211
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,900
It needs to be No, ambitious.

212
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,500
It needs to be grounded in like some very core visceral, feelings, and values.

213
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:08,400
And those things take time to discuss and to hash out with the, with your internal team with market research, or just a lot of different inputs, you need to go into refining that.

214
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,400
And so, I have done that work at buffer and an oyster and for other companies and kind of advisory capacity.

215
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,000
And it's may be as fast as it could be.

216
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,800
Is a 62 10-week process, that is maybe being a bit ambitious, even in like a six-week timeline.

217
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:33,700
And so more often, it's a quarters worth of work to really get to the details into that and get something that you can be confident in as well.

218
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,800
If you don't want to rush out a brand that you don't feel fully bought into either.

219
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,900
So that works really important.

220
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:48,500
I think, for me, it comes down to, you know, starting with the why, why does our company exist and that's often the question that gets answered by the founding team.

221
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Ideally, they had a, why?

222
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
When they started out.

223
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,800
And so, hopefully, that why is compelling enough?

224
00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:05,100
Otherwise, I am happy to come up with a different why that makes sense to so, starting with that Y, and then marrying that to a tension that you find out in the culture and the market at large.

225
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:18,900
And I think that's where a brand can really come to life and resonate in a powerful way when you're connecting this Y, which is often, you know, a personal need or a personal problem that you're solving to this broader.

226
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:25,000
Cultural tension that applies to many other people and can have like some natural scale and resonance to it.

227
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:33,300
So that's, you know, not an easy thing to figure out, but it the closer you get to the heart of your brand and like what your Brand's best self is the easier.

228
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,500
It is to start to notice where those overlaps might be.

229
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
So that's the first phase and the second phase is.

230
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:39,700
Yeah.

231
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,500
The once we figure all this out, how do we make sure we're being consistent about it?

232
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,300
That am I mean that is an ongoing process.

233
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:52,100
I think I have been very lucky that Bufferin at ways to maybe I will share a waster is example.

234
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:59,200
Oyster, we are very aligned on what type of mission we have as a company and how that relates to our brand.

235
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:07,900
So it's very clear alignment and obvious alignment for everyone of what we're trying to do as a company in the short medium, and long term, a twister.

236
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,300
And that's a great place to start from.

237
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,600
So then my challenge is a marketing leader as well.

238
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:22,600
How do I make sure that We are all consistently applying that brand to are our internal experience, our external communication?

239
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,300
Like there's so many different layers of this that permeate every single team within the business.

240
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,100
And if you're not careful about it, as time goes on, you will start to notice.

241
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:41,300
Some people starting to interpret this brand from a slightly different shade and then all of a sudden, you know, six months later, it is an entirely different narrative that you not, you can hardly recognize from where it started with.

242
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,500
And so, I have to keep reminding myself.

243
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,300
I need to be Overly communicative, I need to share more than I think.

244
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,200
I need to share any to repeat.

245
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,900
What might seem very obvious to me just, you know, I think you have to say something seven times before it sinks in.

246
00:27:53,900 --> 00:28:00,400
So I have to say something seven times every month because I think it you know, you lose it after every month to you, need to keep refreshing.

247
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,700
And so it just becomes a very much an always-on process for us.

248
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,400
And we're kind of working through that toy store at the moment.

249
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:26,500
Wow, so even after that first quarter of getting the strategy, Get outta line with executive leadership, communicating out launching it out, even thereafter years after you're still continuing to bring alignment communication.

250
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,600
And I am guessing the brand also evolve May evolve.

251
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,800
And how do you handle that?

252
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:49,400
Yeah, I definitely evolved anywhere in one of those Evolution stages that oyster, at the moment, we're very much about Global Employment today, but we see a path in the future where from More expansive, even Beyond Global Employment into many different aspects of future of work.

253
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,800
And I think it's both a question of how do you, how do you make that transition?

254
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,100
But also, when do you make that transition?

255
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,100
When is the sequencing and timing right to go from A to B?

256
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,400
And I mean, the fortunate thing is there's no, there's no like Playbook to follow.

257
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,500
And so, they're in a sense.

258
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,300
There's no wrong answer to some of this.

259
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,000
I think a lot of it is going into it with eyes wide open and acknowledging.

260
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,500
Like, yes, this is the Trajectory, we need to be on and the steps that need to happen.

261
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,000
And let us I think it's always unique for every company.

262
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,800
And so let us look at the circumstances and understand what makes the most sense for us today.

263
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,100
And so for us, that waster, for instance, we haven't had our employment brand.

264
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,800
I mean, oyster is a two-and-a-half-year-old company in general.

265
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,500
And so the brand hasn't had a lot of time to bake fully yet.

266
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:43,300
Since I think that reason, like, it makes sense to keep going on the employment side, a bit more before you switch gears to something else.

267
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:50,200
But then also, I think you want to do it in a way that isn't jarring for the market as well.

268
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,700
Like, there's a total Rebrand, which is almost like a single point in time we were this thing.

269
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:13,000
And now we're this thing, there's almost like a, like, an ICP, or Persona change where we were about these people and now we're about these people but there's more of like the underlying brand values brand strategy piece, which is maybe not as evident right away to the market.

270
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:21,900
But over time you start to get at this shift into what people are expecting, sometimes that can happen with, you know, we're going to expand our product line from.

271
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,100
We used to sell this thing to we're going to sell it to other thing.

272
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:30,700
You see that a lot with like d to C brands that are selling like I think Obama is the socks company.

273
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:45,800
Like, I know them as a sock company, but they sell t-shirts, and, and underwear and all these different things now, and like, over time, my understanding of that brand is going to evolve, but it wasn't like a single point in time when bomb was like, was like socks from the website.

274
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,700
We're going to go all in on this thing instead.

275
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,300
Like I think is a very natural progression that a lot of brands have to undertake.

276
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,400
And it's not something you want to.

277
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,300
You want to feel like a very abrupt shift if it doesn't have to be in.

278
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,400
So it's an interesting process of.

279
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:12,500
How do you work through design and that way where you're making tweaks, rather than complete overhauls through copy through voice and tone through the images that you use, like there's just a lot of different components that you can kind of sequence, each of those in and of themselves, too.

280
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:37,000
So it's almost like I think about change management and kind of take some of those same principles of how you manage change with people and orgs with your brand as well because things can't be too abrupt or, you know, you can't just say like, all right we're going to rear and tomorrow you know, there's a lot of sequencing, a lot of things involved.

281
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,100
So yeah, thank you for walking us through so going into 2023.

282
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,300
I am seeing some folks talk about investing into their brand.

283
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,000
How do you see it?

284
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,900
Because I know budgets are getting tighter.

285
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:09,900
We have to show, you know, Roi with smaller amounts of spend and you know, hopefully deliver 10x even like 20x out of like less spend is sometimes the pressure that some folks have been communicating.

286
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,700
But what's your sense?

287
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,300
Ahow brand strategy and investing into your brand, can help.

288
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,500
Play into next year's prodigies.

289
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,400
It's an interesting topic.

290
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:33,800
One of the things I often think about with marketing, is its marketing job to be two to three years ahead of the company and that is something that I hope, I hope pretty dire.

291
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:48,500
In terms of that long-term thinking, long-term strategy, and that often gets lost in moments like this, where you're so focused on the near term and You know, next quarter's revenue, or next quarter sleeve volume and is very real-time metrics, essentially.

292
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:57,400
And so, as a market leader, I try to find ways to ensure that I am still including long-term planning into my plans and advocating for that.

293
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,000
And brand is one of those very significant long-term plays for our team and for many marketing teams.

294
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,900
And so that's like the broader lens that I think of it through brand is our greatest.

295
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,600
What's going to help us differentiate and way in a long term and I think it's really important that companies.

296
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:19,400
These are aware of what their long-term strategy is for this for winning, or for growth, whatever the case may be.

297
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:28,200
And so that doesn't necessarily help like, when you get your resource and budget number, and it's smaller than what you expected me have to make some really hard trade-offs.

298
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:36,900
And so, for me, when I am in those conversations, it's become a shift from Brand, being a brand awareness play.

299
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:54,300
Like, that's get as many people to know about oyster or buffer or welcome as possible and it becomes More about how can our brand, how does our brand influence, the sales funnel or the marketing funnel, or the self-serve funnel, like, whatever funnels, you have, because brand does have an influence on that.

300
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:06,700
Oftentimes, it's hard, it's harder to measure than like a direct Roi type measure of Performance Marketing or conversions, things like that, but if you take brand out of that, you will see a lot of your numbers change.

301
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,500
And when you put Brandon to it, you will see all of your numbers improve.

302
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,600
And like if you can get more clarity into what those numbers are, what those are.

303
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,000
Facts are I think it makes the case a little bit easier to invest in Grand.

304
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:31,300
And so that's one of the ways that we have been thinking of it, specifically tying brand to metrics like our LTV or tying it to metrics like our yield on, how much we spend on ads versus how much pipeline we generate or even something like sales velocity.

305
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:37,199
Like in theory, if someone knows and loves your brand, the first conversation is going to be easier than be more likely to move.

306
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,000
The second conversation closing.

307
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It will be easier because whoever they have to get approval from may already know about you and I feel good about you.

308
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,900
So that's where Branch shows up for me and moments like this.

309
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,600
And this is one of the places where I point others to, when I am advocating on behalf of grand.

310
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,000
Hmm, that's really good.

311
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,500
Thanks for sharing that.

312
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:05,500
So for you all, when you get into these planning modes for thinking about the next one year to three years.

313
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
What's that process?

314
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,600
Like are you first having the conversation with your leadership and then do you have like a team?

315
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:18,300
Team, what does the team look like on marketing to be able to execute on a brand strategy?

316
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah.

317
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:29,800
So ideally we have a three to five-year company strategy, which would come from a CEO, or a founding team, or her c-suite leadership team.

318
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:43,800
And that's really helpful to know, like, where do we want to be as a company in three to five years now, because that obviously will dictate what we want, our brand to be three to five years from now, I think what where it gets really challenging as if no one's thinking, three to five years ahead.

319
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:56,300
And he was a market leader of the only one thinking, three to five years ahead, then all of a sudden I know, I have been in places like that where I am putting up strategies together and like is anyone actually going to agree with me about this direction?

320
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:01,400
I am saying we should go in 23 years and so that is a challenge.

321
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:11,400
I, so I say if you don't have that definitely push for it or ask for it within your team and Company to have that company long-term Vision to ground your brand strategy.

322
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:18,500
And but then from there is its a lot of going back to that company strategy is doing market research.

323
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
And understand like where are the trends today?

324
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:27,400
And how they evolved over the past two to three years and almost like projecting out where you think they could be two to three years.

325
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:37,200
Now, it's important to bring as many data in as you can, but there's always going to be a pretty hefty dose of qualitative input into like a three to five-year Vision document for brand.

326
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:45,900
And then involving your team is really helpful to like, can you get insights from your product marketing team since they know the markets so well, and they know customers.

327
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:54,400
While can, you get inside some growths team on what channels are I am the best and even how Channel performance has evolved over the past couple of years, and they evolve into the future.

328
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:02,800
Once you have all those inputs, usually a brand strategy becomes a bit more clear to see Mmm, that's good.

329
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,500
Okay.

330
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,700
And if anybody has any questions, feel free to drop them in the Q&A tab.

331
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,400
I would love to transition our conversation.

332
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:19,900
Speaking about teams talking about how you are building a pretty awesome, team culture from what I have heard from your teammates.

333
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:30,200
So, you know, just FYI, you have got that good third-party feedback, coming out your leadership and the team Dynamic that you have built over at oyster.

334
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,400
Currently, how many team members do you have on the marketing team?

335
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,600
What is, what is your org look like?

336
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:45,200
And yeah, how do you manage them a week to week?

337
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,300
I would love to hear about just your, you know what?

338
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,000
What does workflow look and feel like?

339
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,200
Yeah.

340
00:37:52,200 --> 00:38:00,100
So, we're a 50-person marketing team today 50, and we have, I guess, where you can consider a matrix marketing organs.

341
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,700
So, we have Pillars of brand marketing, product, marketing, and growth marketing.

342
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:33,700
And then we have to supporting layers of content and design and then as we have kind of scaled to the team size right now, we were able to carve out a group called strategic projects that which works on most like startup within a start-up kind of ideas as well as business operations, which has helped us a lot and of organizing ourselves and our processes, and they're hoping everything runs smoother and so it's been a steep learning curve for me like T people is a lot of wonderful people to get to work with.

343
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:39,400
So I learned a lot about how to I am still learning a lot about how to manage, all that.

344
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,400
I guess like to get people moving in the same direction.

345
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:50,000
I think has been a really interesting puzzle to solve, and so we have a number of different rituals that we use to.

346
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
I hope a good effect.

347
00:38:51,400 --> 00:39:05,900
I don't know what the word of mouth would be on my team's feelings about the rituals, but I have enjoyed putting them in place, and if I don't know if this complicates it or makes it easier, I often think this makes it a bit easier, but it might not sound that way, but we are a very asynchronous call.

348
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:16,500
Our oyster and so we don't spend a lot of time in synchronous meetings discussing strategy or checking in like a lot of that happens in a Google Document or in slack or in the ocean.

349
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:35,800
And so that for me has helped because I am able to document a lot of the thoughts that come out of my head or come out of my chats of the marketing leadership team or come out of different parts of the business document that and then put it in a place where people can access it on their own terms at their own time and kind of on demand.

350
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:44,100
Moving forward, and so I think that helps when you get to a certain scale where you have information easily accessible for people whenever they need it and want it.

351
00:39:45,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So that's been a help I think as we have scaled, and we have also been very deliberate about putting our strategy down on paper working in a sauna for project management is that we start from strategic planning to move all that into a sauna for project management.

352
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,800
We also use a sign up for goal tracking, then we have a biweekly live stand up.

353
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:21,200
We all get together to discuss performance to date but also use that time to connect as a team to highlight other voices on the team, so they can share like work in progress or deep dives into their areas and feel like we're again moving in the same direction.

354
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:28,500
Honestly, I am really grateful for the leaders that I have on my team because so much of managing a 50-person team happens when I am not there.

355
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,400
And when I have no idea what's going on in.

356
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,700
So, like in the individual departs, like sub departments within marketing.

357
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,900
There's so much good work.

358
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,800
That happens with those.

359
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:41,300
Dividual teams and their cultures in terms of moving in the same direction, communication team building.

360
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:51,000
And so, it becomes especially important to be a good manager of managers when you get to the scale because you won't have direct contact with the majority of the folks in your organic more.

361
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,000
That's great.

362
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:03,900
And I am curious like what are some of those challenges that you have run into where you have had to problem solve and figure it out?

363
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,100
Yeah, we have a few, there's always a few.

364
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:16,000
So one of the ones is I think it's due to this concept that I have called push-and-pull.

365
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,600
So we have a cremation.

366
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,800
We're very, very many documentarians with an oyster.

367
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:28,500
And so, a lot of information is available for folks to look and see and I will probably incorrectly often come to the assumption that.

368
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,300
Well, it's in the here.

369
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:34,100
So of course, people know to look here and you know, people probably don't know to look there.

370
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:40,200
They No, they don't look somewhere but there's so many places to look at so many things to read it just doesn't get read or doesn't get seen.

371
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:48,200
It doesn't get like fully integrated into their plans and strategies and so that's one of the risks that we have as an asynchronous culture.

372
00:41:48,200 --> 00:42:04,500
And as a team of our size is that we have important things that we are putting in a synchronous document that might not resonate or even be seen by as many people as we think they're being feeling consumed by plus one on one when risk, another thing that's popped up.

373
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,100
Recently.

374
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,700
Is that during the planning phase?

375
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:14,400
We have a concept of these are, you know, the five to 10, big projects that we want to do as a team over the next quarter.

376
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:21,100
But, you know, for a 50-person team, you can do 5 to 10 big projects that still have a ton of, you know, either always on work.

377
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:21,600
That's happening.

378
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
Anyway or additional work.

379
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,400
Like there's lots of bandwidths to do some really great stuff.

380
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,600
And so how do you prioritize almost like the second layer priorities?

381
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:49,000
Beneath the 5210, big things and often times when the It's about is in the production areas, like content or design or marketing operations, or lifecycle or website, like these creative units that are needing to build infrastructure or create assets and things like that.

382
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,200
And so, we felt some crunch there to have, like, it's clear with the big things that we're working on.

383
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:00,300
What does that mean for everything else that we can work on and want to work on and maybe should be working on as well?

384
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,800
And so, we haven't necessarily solve that puzzle yet, but we're aware.

385
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,500
It is a puzzle.

386
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:17,200
How to solve at the moment, I think it's huge that your team members can even bring these things up and there's that trust and transparency to.

387
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:27,600
It sounds like quickly surface any challenges and you know even if it's not resolved ASAP like we're working together to figure it out.

388
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:38,000
So how have you have established that level of collaboration transparency See, you know, how did you create that kind of culture?

389
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,500
That is a good question.

390
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,000
I think I should ask him my teammates at what they think was successful to get there.

391
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:55,900
Like I do believe that Like, I always try to build teams with trust respect and affirmation is some of the core values of the teams that I am building.

392
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:05,900
So the fact that trust is so front and center for me, I think does kind of work through a lot of the different connection points that I have with my team?

393
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,700
Whether it's consciously or subconsciously, as I am doing it.

394
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:14,800
And so, as an example, the way that I lead and manage people is very, very open.

395
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,400
It's very, I give a lot of autonomy to folks.

396
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,000
I am often asking for feedback or very receptive to feedback when it's shared.

397
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:33,900
I think that builds a certain amount of safety in sharing your feedback with No, with your boss or manager or team Lee.

398
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,600
Like, I think that psychological safety is really important.

399
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,700
So I do that a lot to the, the way that I manage those, I try to do that through the way that I manage.

400
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,500
We also have regular surveys that we do both at the company level.

401
00:44:46,500 --> 00:45:01,500
But then we're also often asking the team for feedback at like, a stand-up or in stock, and then the important thing is to ask, but then to return the results to people, so they see that, oh, this person asked this saw the results, and this is the action that you're From them.

402
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:17,400
So we just did our queue for employee engagement survey as the company and marketing's results were sent to me in the market leadership team, and we kind of had a chance to talk about all this, but then we were like, well let us ask the team what they think about these results to, and so we share the results with the team.

403
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,900
And then ask them, these are the themes that we noticed from your feedback.

404
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,400
Did we get it right?

405
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:27,500
And if not let us know, but if so like what do you think you would like to see happen?

406
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,600
Next, as a result of this and take their thoughts into Duration with that.

407
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:48,500
And, so I think those I guess those processes and systems really do help to build that psychological safety in the build a culture where it's okay to give feedback you know, up down or horizontal, and so we're lucky that has been the case for us so far, that's awesome.

408
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,600
Thanks for sharing.

409
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,400
All right we have got a couple of questions actually coming through.

410
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,600
So let us go ahead and pull up and question.

411
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,000
What are some marketing tactics you have used too successfully?

412
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Bring awareness to Brand you worked on?

413
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,100
And is there anything you tried?

414
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,400
That didn't work like you thought it would.

415
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:10,800
Yeah.

416
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:19,900
So the ones that have worked really well for us at waster, have been our PR and our thought leadership and our social media work.

417
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,200
And we have seen some really impressive scale from those channels.

418
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:33,000
So specifically, when it comes to getting placements in Tier 1, Yeah, that's four different stories that we want to tell and then using our either our own profile.

419
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:48,300
So like our oyster LinkedIn profile or using the profiles of some of our most influential people within the company, like our CEO or a founding team or some of our leaders and thinking of them, almost as brand ambassadors and putting together content strategy and thought leadership behind them.

420
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:53,200
We have seen some really powerful scale for the brand to that one of the next steps.

421
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,300
There's then to tie that into like a full, I guess you could think of it as an employee.

422
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,500
Agassi the strategy.

423
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,800
And so, how do you get the hundreds of people who work at oyster?

424
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:08,700
Also, sharing on LinkedIn or Twitter or Tick, Tock, or whatever the case may be on behalf of your brand and the things in the stories that are important to you.

425
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:15,800
And so, that's, that's kind of really large scale, sustainable way to move the brand.

426
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:29,400
We have also spent money on the brand and so events is a really big lever for us to being very targeted to which events resonate most with your target audience, or which events resonate with Because the way you want to be perceived in the market.

427
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:36,100
And so the difference for us in that case is we want to show up at HR events because we are an HR Tech platform.

428
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,100
I always stir, and so we have a presence there, but then we also want to be known as Innovative.

429
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,600
We want to make kind of splash in the Silicon Valley seems.

430
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:51,600
So we're showing up at Tech events, likes a stir or web Summit as well because it connects our brand with kind of has this bigger Zeitgeist around Tech.

431
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,600
So those have been helpful for us, I would say on the side that hasn't worked as well.

432
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,300
We have done some, some very initial testing and out-of-home advertising which I think can work.

433
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:25,900
Well if you get the strategy right but it requires a certain amount of investment to really an investment and belief and time like to really let that sink in and to get it to work the way you want to, when we did it, we advertised on some Billboards in San Francisco and the primary benefit of that for us is we could take a picture of it and share it on LinkedIn.

434
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:32,100
It was almost like a social proof thing more so than an actual brand Impressions or brain consideration kind of play.

435
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,400
So that would be.

436
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,100
I would be somewhat careful about that.

437
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:41,600
But otherwise, it's, you know, I think for us it's a lot of, it depends on what is the goal of your brand?

438
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:47,800
Like, if you're going after brand impression doesn't number, then yes, channels like PR social media.

439
00:48:47,800 --> 00:49:00,100
Make a lot of sense because of the scale, if you After more of like a brand consideration aspects that may be something like a podcast, which is a bit more intimate than maybe doesn't scale, to as many eyes or ears in that case.

440
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:06,100
I think you can be very, very specific and targeted based on what outcome you want to drive for your brand.

441
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,200
It's great.

442
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:17,400
We have got another question from Spencer in this time of justifying marketing, spend improving Roi.

443
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,400
How do you show the value of brand marketing?

444
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,400
Great question.

445
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,300
It's it gets tricky and I think a lot of it depends on what is most important to.

446
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,100
What is most important to the people who are most important that your company is?

447
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:46,200
So that's probably the CEO but in some cases it might be like a Chief Financial Officer clo or just whatever the hierarchy looks like it company like what are the things that matter the most to those folks and how do you connect brand to them?

448
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,300
And so it has a general rule.

449
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:53,700
I would say connecting Brands to any sort of efficiency metric today is going to be really helpful.

450
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:00,300
Like I mentioned earlier, that could be something like LTV or yield sale.

451
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,900
Lost city is another example.

452
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:08,000
So connecting it back to these metrics that help you get more efficient with your spend, with your acquisition.

453
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,900
That's one way that I have seen it.

454
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:15,700
Be really effective, but I have also seen it be effective with kind of broader company's strategic decisions.

455
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:21,400
Like if you want to go after category, creation is like your one long-term strategy that you have a high belief in.

456
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,500
Then how do you connect your brand work to category creation that case?

457
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,300
Maybe it is the organic search volume for a particular keyword.

458
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:37,200
Word or maybe it is the number of reviews you get in this certain review website on this certain category term.

459
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:43,900
And so, I think you can marry it to whatever the company strategy is or whatever is most important to the company.

460
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,500
At a time, when I would probably default to an efficiency metric in the meantime.

461
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:54,700
Some of the, like, always on brand goals that we have for, for us, a twister is, what is are aided recall?

462
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:58,100
So running an aided recall survey on brand awareness out the market.

463
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,900
What is the free traffic to our Website?

464
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,400
And so how many people are coming direct to our website?

465
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,800
How many people are being referred to our website?

466
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:11,100
So clicking on a link that someone else said about Western coming here or what is like or organic.

467
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:20,200
Search volume both for like any relevant search term, but it's even more specifically for Brandon Search terms like how many people are typing oyster?

468
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:25,400
Oyster HR oyster Global Employment into a search engine and finding us that way.

469
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,900
So those are kind of like the always on one side.

470
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:33,400
We look at as well as share a voice which is more of a market, share kpi.

471
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,000
Those arms are kind of always on.

472
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,400
There we go.

473
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,700
For the next one.

474
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,300
Yeah, it's a tricky one.

475
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,500
We use Blended share of voice for the market, share one.

476
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:51,000
And so we're measuring across paid search, social PR in organic search.

477
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:57,300
And this shirt like the specific percentage of she avoids, very some differently, across all four of them.

478
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,600
So we're trying to find a way to blend them into like one metric.

479
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,400
But in general, we usually based it on how many competitors we have their space.

480
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,200
And so we have two main competitors in our space and so if you think of if All equal.

481
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,100
We should all have 33 percent share of the market.

482
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:17,100
So we want more than 33 percent is the way we would goal ourselves in that case.

483
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,500
That's great.

484
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,400
Alright wow, like I need to play back.

485
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:29,400
This recording is there so much that you shared with us and believe or not.

486
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:35,700
We only have like five minutes left before we wrap up, Kevin.

487
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,600
I know that you have got a job board and you have got resources.

488
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,700
And so we have got some links here.

489
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,300
Your palate.com or can I go ahead and share?

490
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:48,500
Sure.

491
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,100
That it is there.

492
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:56,700
Anything else that as a marketing Community we could learn benefit from with the resources you currently have.

493
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,300
Yeah, that's a great one.

494
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,600
Yeah, you're welcome to share that link.

495
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,500
So this is a jobs board for remote.

496
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,500
Jobs in particular, remote marketing jobs.

497
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:13,400
You're welcome to just check out the link there and look at the jobs and hopefully it's helpful for you or someone in your network if they're looking for work.

498
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:23,900
But also, if you want to apply to be part of what's called a Within that transport, it just helps me make introductions or connections to hiring companies as well.

499
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:28,000
If you're currently in the job market or looking for your next opportunity.

500
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,200
So would love to support you in that way.

501
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:36,900
If that's helpful for you, if you do, subscribe to the newsletter, you will get to hear from me once a week.

502
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,300
You can unsubscribe anytime.

503
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:42,100
If you get tired of hearing from me once a week, but you can get some resources there.

504
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:55,200
I am often sharing their stories from oyster or buffer, sharing resources that were using sharing Ideas that are on my head and so, it's very much like a real time look into the stuff that matters to me at the moment.

505
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:04,000
And then there is a paid app head section of that newsletter, which gives you access to my personal notion workspace, which has a bunch of different templates and play books and things.

506
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:13,500
They're all the proceeds from that newsletter, go to a non-profit that's helping to bring more or folks of underrepresented groups into Tech.

507
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:19,500
So, if you're welcome to subscribe there and get access to notion as well, That's amazing.

508
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:20,600
All right.

509
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:36,100
Kevin with the wrap up, is there one word of encouragement or advice that you could leave the B2B a community with Yeah, I probably tie it back to where we started, which is, I came from a very non-traditional background into Tech.

510
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:44,600
And I think that non-traditional background is something that can resonate very deeply in a very crowded and noisy B2B marketing space.

511
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:51,200
And so embrace the non-traditional, think outside the box, go big, go wild.

512
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,900
Like we have a saying, like, we celebrate moonshots and roof shots.

513
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:01,400
So, as long as you have some moonshots in addition to all the Roof shots the validating the stuff that you're doing.

514
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,700
Like, I think that is that makes for a really good mix and then just feel free to be bold with it.

515
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,400
I think that's where a lot of great performance comes from, a might be harder to measure.

516
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:18,700
Might be harder to tie directly back to some sort of Roi, but it's worth it to get your brand and your product heard out in the market today.

517
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,100
Love that.

518
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,200
Thank you so much.

519
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,300
Kevin, we appreciate you.

520
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:31,400
We're so grateful for everything you're investing into the community and so all the best to you and your team your endeavors.

521
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,900

Awesome.

525
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,000
All right.

526
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:46,500
Well with that, our next event is taking place next week, so we are going to be interviewing Alex from Saros.

527
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:56,700
He is the director of digital marketing, and it's going to be a great conversation on really looking at content and figuring out.

528
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:01,700
What is that attention-grabbing Marketing in a noisy market?

529
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:08,300

534
00:56:47,300 --> 00:57:10,200
Again, is the greatest thing?

535
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,300
No, debating on.
