All right?

18
00:19:58,052 --> 00:20:08,252
So jumping into our panel topic today, you know, as we all are feeling this, you know, we're dealing with remote work.

19
00:20:08,352 --> 00:20:19,352
And on one side, there's an amazing upside of the quality of life, but there's also the challenge, Challenge of eroded boundaries between work and personal life.

20
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:28,352
And, you know, there's this need right now, the craving that employees have what whether your remote weather, your hybrid, whatever your situation is that you're working.

21
00:20:29,152 --> 00:20:39,552
The common denominator is that employees are seeking that support and that connection that value, like I value you.

22
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:47,252
And I value that you're here part of our organization at as you're navigating these Teas with a distributed workplace.

23
00:20:47,252 --> 00:20:55,952
There's some key ways in which we as leaders and managers and even individual contributors can show up and support one another.

24
00:20:56,152 --> 00:21:02,952
You know, there's this statistic here that shows employees who work for compassionate manager.

25
00:21:03,352 --> 00:21:07,152
Their 25% more engaged in their jobs.

26
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:14,852
20% of them are more committed to the organization and 11% are less likely to burn.

27
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:21,352
Burnout Katie's going to drop in chat the research there so you can double-click into that a little bit more.

28
00:21:21,552 --> 00:21:28,652
But you know the research shows it rights there that compassionate managers and leaders do make a big difference.

29
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:36,152
So with that I would love to introduce our panel today.

30
00:21:36,552 --> 00:21:44,852
We have got Kim who is the head of employee experience with oyster Bobby, the regional director of people.

Nice to be here to see you all.

43
00:22:22,752 --> 00:22:25,852
I am with a company called oyster.

44
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:30,752
We are Employment platform that helps companies to hire people anywhere in the world.

45
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:36,452
So that you are not a cure not limited to the talent pool, that happens to be within a geographic radius of your office.

47
00:22:44,552 --> 00:22:58,552
That comes with anyone on this call who is part of an HRT, more people obscene those that it's very complicated to hire people outside of your, your space oyster is over 600 employees now, and we're going Now, over 70 countries.

48
00:22:59,052 --> 00:23:09,252
So we are an extremely globally, distributed team, and I get to spend my days building and trying to make sure that we have a consistent employee experience.

49
00:23:09,252 --> 00:23:23,352
No matter where you are in the world, no matter whether you have overlapping time zones with anyone else on your team, trying to ensure that everyone feels a sense of inclusion on belonging and has a really seamless and great experience being a part of the oyster team.

50
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:26,352
And I am calling in from my home office.

51
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:32,052
Which is About one square meter of the corner of my living room.

52

00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:42,652
Bobby, how about you?

55
00:23:42,652 --> 00:23:43,852
Tell us a little bit about culture.

56
00:23:43,852 --> 00:23:45,752
Ab and what you get to do with them?

57
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:47,952
Yeah, thank you first.

58
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:50,752
Thank you for your enthusiasm and your excitement.

59
00:23:50,752 --> 00:23:56,452
You're getting a lot of love around your energy in the chat there and also Kim, a lot of love for oyster to.

60
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:59,152
So, It's great to see as it was mentioned.

61
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:00,552
My name is Bobby Malloy.

62
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:03,952
My role at culture amp is as Regional director of people science.

63
00:24:03,952 --> 00:24:11,852
As Kim was saying, she helps cultivate an employee experience, and we are an employee experience platform that helps users.

64
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:14,852
Like Kim cultivate that experience in your organization.

65
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:21,352
So, we are a software platform sort of end to end in terms of experience.

66
00:24:21,352 --> 00:24:26,352
So from candidate and onboarding through engagement and performance.

67
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:29,852
And development all the way through exit and alumni.

68
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:42,452
We have you covered there and so in our role in people science we are a group of people with backgrounds and Industrial organizational psychology and organizational development.

69
00:24:42,552 --> 00:24:47,752
And we help you design tools in our platform in service of cultivating, your experience strategy.

70
00:24:48,152 --> 00:25:08,352
So whether that looks like actually designing those tools or helping you interpret, some of the data that you get back, when you send out employee surveys, or you go oh, through a performance management process or you have a development cycle for your employees, were there with you, to help you kind of craft that strategy and then ultimately take action.

71
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:13,152
So ultimately, it's all in the service of improving the workplace.

72
00:25:13,352 --> 00:25:14,052
Happy to be here.

73
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:15,852
Love it.

74
00:25:15,852 --> 00:25:17,052
Well, we're glad you're here.

75
00:25:17,552 --> 00:25:29,052
So, you know, we're talking about this research that I just pulled up on how employees who work for compassionate, managers are likely to be more engaged.

76
00:25:29,052 --> 00:25:32,652
They are more committed to an org, they're less likely to burn out.

77
00:25:32,752 --> 00:25:39,452
Now each of you are seeing the data or creating the experience to further encourage this.

78
00:25:39,452 --> 00:25:44,052
Now there's a lot of going on right now in the world, you know, you go on LinkedIn.

79
00:25:44,052 --> 00:25:47,752
There's a new Said that just got laid off and you're just like, ah, gosh.

80
00:25:47,752 --> 00:25:51,952
This is a very unstable uncomfortable time.

81
00:25:52,252 --> 00:26:06,552
And so how do you create engagement and motivation within a workplace particularly, if recently, somebody's gone through substantial layoffs, how can we do that as Leaders managers?

82
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:17,052
I have you to start work about, we both like jumped in at the same time I will give it a start on a pass it on to you.

83
00:26:17,652 --> 00:26:49,552
I think the thing to remember about all of this as is that as much as we desperately need data and metrics and thus like people science that we're all here, we're all so culture, a I am a decade-long culture, a superfan, if we need, all of that data to help build the business case, Says, I am and build and an objective viewpoint on overall holistic Trends, but at the core of it, we're dealing with people, we're dealing with humans.

84
00:26:49,552 --> 00:26:54,152
And so taking this human Centric approach to realizing that everyone has stuff going on in their lives.

85
00:26:54,152 --> 00:27:09,452
Everyone has a life outside of work and that's something that and depend on McCrea, Lee brought to light in a way that maybe people were able to hide or create a line between their home lives and their work lives pre-pandemic in a way that we just haven't been able too lately.

86
00:27:09,452 --> 00:27:16,952
And so creating that level of Engagement is it's not about saying, well what do we need to do to increase our engagement score?

87
00:27:16,952 --> 00:27:30,952
It's what do we need to do to support the whole human that showing up to work whether that's showing up in a co-working space, showing up in a physical office showing up on a call with their toddler hanging off of them because their school had a closure like these things.

88
00:27:30,952 --> 00:27:38,852
All Impact how we can show up at work and how we show up at work is how we experience our engagement Network.

89
00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:51,152
If people feel supported, and they feel heard, and they feel like their full life experience, Eiffel lived experience can be represented in their workplace then that will translate into higher level of Engagement.

90
00:27:53,852 --> 00:28:05,852
I would say the example that you use of the outset was around layoffs and ultimately that's under the umbrella of something that we might consider to be a hard time.

91
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,352
There're a layoffs there's the pandemic.

92
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:14,152
There's Any number of examples that you could use but ultimately it is an example of change.

93
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:25,752
And so when you're thinking about, how do we either lean in or lean out, think about the fact that whenever there is change, you should be leaning into helping to make sure that change goes smoothly.

94
00:28:25,952 --> 00:28:48,552
Now, you do that with number one, like open acknowledgement, so don't put your head in the sand and acknowledge when there is a layoff acknowledge when there are hard times going on in the world around us and With creating the space, to give people the grace to express how those challenges might be affecting them but then also solicit feedback from your employees.

95
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:52,552
So, get a sense for what's going, well during this change, what's not going.

96
00:28:52,552 --> 00:28:58,552
So well during this change so that you can focus your efforts on improving, the things that are not going.

97
00:28:58,552 --> 00:29:04,052
Well, I would say in terms of layoffs, think about it from three levels.

98
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:22,052
Think about it from the organization level acknowledge you know you can Get feedback in aggregate across the organization, but it's probably a little bit demoralizing to communicate, a layoff to your employees and for your employees to hear that about their organization.

99
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:30,952
And so you need to understand how they're feeling in order to tailor your Communications in ways that are going to get them remote abated and re-engaged.

100
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:38,852
For managers, you know, really help employees understand why these decisions were made and how these decisions were made giving.

101
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:40,052
See to the process.

102
00:29:40,052 --> 00:29:56,752
Can help people really feel like there was fairness and equity in the decisions that were made so that they remain motivated to continue working for you and then employees, you know, you might have something like survivor's guilt, which tends to be pretty common as a result of layoffs.

103
00:29:56,752 --> 00:30:15,052
And so if that's the case, acknowledge that to your mentor, to your manager, but also really acknowledge when you're overwhelmed or overworked because speaking up is what's going to get you, the That you need so that you're not oppressed by, you know, the lean way of working now that other people have been laid off.

104
00:30:16,952 --> 00:30:24,252
And I would just like to add one thing to that, which is this idea of acknowledging, the pain, the pain of it.

105
00:30:24,352 --> 00:30:34,252
And acknowledging, the hook, the difficulty of it, I am not saying that you should say post a selfie crying about how hard it was for you, to lay off your staff.

106
00:30:34,652 --> 00:30:41,052
But acknowledging, especially for the people who are still there that like this is hard, this is a hard thing for us to go through as a business.

107
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:43,552
It's a hard thing for us to lose people who we love working with.

108
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:59,652
This is the Why we had to make this decision and how we made this decision, and we just want to acknowledge that it's painful and it's difficult for all of us, and we want to move through this together, but we're not going to jump straight to action.

109
00:30:59,652 --> 00:31:02,752
We're not going to jump straight past your grief for your struggle or challenges.

110
00:31:02,752 --> 00:31:05,452
Here's the safe way that we can talk about this.

111
00:31:05,452 --> 00:31:25,352
Here's might think about providing counseling services or reminding people about the Mental Health Resources, you have available, you can't just gloss over You see that a lot from leaders during layoffs, if they want to jump straight to but it's all going to be okay because here's our strong team that we're left with and that doesn't acknowledge the emotional experience.

112
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:28,452
That people are having as they're going through it.

113
00:31:30,352 --> 00:31:30,652
Wow.

114
00:31:30,652 --> 00:31:32,452
That's totally.

115
00:31:32,952 --> 00:31:33,252
Right.

116
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:36,752
Right on a very human in approach.

117
00:31:37,552 --> 00:31:39,552
How do you see that actually happening?

118
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:41,552
As far as the communication touchpoints?

119
00:31:41,552 --> 00:31:46,652
Like, there's the company level, there's the one-on-ones, there's the team seeing Inks.

120
00:31:46,652 --> 00:31:49,252
And there's may be other types of gatherings in between.

121
00:31:49,252 --> 00:31:54,852
So how do you, you know, in change management and these transitions?

122
00:31:54,852 --> 00:31:59,752
Like how, how do you communicate with transparency yet also have compassion?

123
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:02,452
And what does that look like cascaded?

124
00:32:05,152 --> 00:32:05,852
You want to take it?

125
00:32:07,452 --> 00:32:09,052
I was going to let you speak first this time.

126
00:32:09,152 --> 00:32:10,252
Okay, great.

127
00:32:11,152 --> 00:32:18,652
So there's a couple different angles that you could take especially with communication and some of which might not be obvious.

128
00:32:18,652 --> 00:32:26,752
So with strict communication, yes of course, leaders top-down, org-wide Communications, that's important.

129
00:32:27,652 --> 00:32:33,752
What I tend to see across organizational data over, let us say the past like eight months or so.

130
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:41,352
Communication is become one of the number-one drivers of Employee Engagement.

131
00:32:41,352 --> 00:32:55,052
And part of the reason is that people are using Communications, to understand what the future is for the organization, both in the near term and then over the long term, they want to know, coming out of a covid era.

132
00:32:55,052 --> 00:33:17,552
What's our plan, what's our vision and our mission and has that changed from before covid and or from, when I signed on for the organization, And with Communications and for organizations that have seen declines, they have audited their Communications, and they have realized that they have over index toward financial and other types of metrics.

133
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:25,952
And in those Communications they have really tried their thinking was, let us communicate how our profits are the highest.

134
00:33:25,952 --> 00:33:33,952
You know, that they have been in five years or, you know, all of these great numbers, but they have not Incorporated.

135
00:33:34,152 --> 00:33:38,652
It sort of humanistic perspective to those Communications.

136
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:44,852
So people are not necessarily seeing themselves represented in the success of the organization.

137
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:48,052
And there is a little bit of a lack of acknowledgements.

138
00:33:48,052 --> 00:33:53,852
For those organizations that the burdens that have been placed upon people through the covid era.

139
00:33:53,852 --> 00:34:03,152
Now, coming out of it, that the employees have carried in order to make those metrics as good as they are.

140
00:34:04,052 --> 00:34:17,052
And so, the I think the misalignment and perception is that, hey, we're doing this really great thing by showing all these great numbers, but we're not actually acknowledging that it was sacrificed that helped contribute to those numbers.

141
00:34:17,152 --> 00:34:23,052
And so injecting those Communications with a more humanistic perspective, is, is one action?

142
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:38,452
And the other is a little bit of a signal, not necessarily an overt communication, but even in your performance management process, if you have a self-reflective opportunity for employees, To sort of reflect on their experience over the past.

143
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:39,752
Let us say six months.

144
00:34:40,351 --> 00:34:45,252
Having within that, a question about what are some challenges or blockers?

145
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:48,052
That you faced either in work or out of work?

146
00:34:48,052 --> 00:35:03,852
That might have affected your job performance, allowing the Unseen especially in our remote work World, allowing the Unseen or the unheard to have a place for a manager, or a mentor to acknowledge that in a performance.

147
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:17,952
Evaluation can be really powerful and I meant that is a signal, it's not an overt communication but it is a signal that the organization cares about, you know, how the world or how those contextual factors are affecting you.

148
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:21,152
Absolutely.

149
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:31,452
And I think there's a piece of communication to think about, which is that At the end of the day humans are inherently selfish, right?

150
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:33,052
It's a survival mechanism.

151
00:35:33,052 --> 00:35:34,252
Have to think about ourselves.

152
00:35:34,252 --> 00:35:38,052
So any communication to make, think about how the person reading it is.

153
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,952
Going to look at that and say, okay, but what about me?

154
00:35:40,252 --> 00:35:41,252
How does that impact me?

155
00:35:41,652 --> 00:35:42,752
How does that affect my job?

156
00:35:42,752 --> 00:35:45,752
How does that impact my career growth has that picked impacts my work?

157
00:35:45,952 --> 00:35:53,052
If you talk about a shift in the product roadmap whoever's working on that project or adjacent projects are going to think.

158
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:54,452
What does that mean about my products?

159
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:57,152
That mean about the thing that I work on your talent?

160
00:35:57,352 --> 00:35:59,152
Doesn't even wonder does that mean we have to hire different?

161
00:35:59,152 --> 00:36:13,752
People your sales team is going to think it's that completely change our sales cycle so thinking about how everything you communicate is going to be interpreted at least you know not by every single one of your employees that would be a very big task but think about the kind of different personas within your company.

162
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:16,652
And how is this communication going to impact?

163
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:20,352
The person who is a live-in, caregiver for their elderly parent?

164
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,952
And how is it going to impact those employee?

165
00:36:21,952 --> 00:36:23,752
Who is about to go on, Parental leave?

166
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:25,152
And how's it going to impact this employee?

167
00:36:25,152 --> 00:36:26,752
Who just joined the sales team?

168
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,852
On the team that is now being restructured.

169
00:36:30,052 --> 00:36:32,852
Or, and like, thinking about, who is this going to impact the most?

170
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:38,152
But then also people who are not directly involved with it, how might they interpret this communication?

171
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:42,952
And how can I touch on as many levels of inclusion as possible?

172
00:36:45,252 --> 00:36:46,352
That's really great.

173
00:36:46,452 --> 00:36:53,352
I am seeing the question start to pop up, and we have got about 10 minutes till we have to transition over to the part two of today's event.

174
00:36:53,652 --> 00:36:56,252
So let us pull up marinas.

175
00:36:56,452 --> 00:37:04,452
Question servers question on to Stage here, Katie, okay, is compassion a learnable trait.

176
00:37:04,452 --> 00:37:08,152
If so, how do you prepare, new leaders or Future Leaders?

177
00:37:08,152 --> 00:37:09,652
To be compassionate.

178
00:37:09,652 --> 00:37:11,852
And I guess I have a question right above this.

179
00:37:11,852 --> 00:37:16,152
It's like, how do you define compassion is Different from empathy.

180
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,852
And then you can answer this one as well.

181
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:22,052
That is a good question.

182
00:37:22,052 --> 00:37:25,352
I don't, I am not a psych.

183
00:37:25,752 --> 00:37:27,552
I was not a psych major, I was a theater major.

184
00:37:28,552 --> 00:37:34,552
So in terms of defining compassion versus empathy, and we're like, where's the Venn diagram of intersection and the terminology?

185
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,252
I don't know.

186
00:37:35,652 --> 00:37:42,352
But I think it all relates back to this idea of EQ or being able to put yourself in someone else's shoes.

187
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:47,752
Think that is empathy that is compassionate is looking at someone else.

188
00:37:47,852 --> 00:37:56,952
And thinking about their experience, sometimes above your own, but sometimes in addition to your own looking at how is this person going to be impacted by what I say and do.

189
00:37:56,952 --> 00:38:00,152
And that is coachable.

190
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:00,852
That is learnable.

191
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:08,452
I think there are people who are inherently who have more of that in them inherently based on how they were raised or their brain chemistry, or whatever it is.

192
00:38:10,352 --> 00:38:16,252
But there are definitely people who see that as something that's like this is a skill, I need to learn and it's a foreign concept to me.

193
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:24,752
Not because I don't believe in Fashion, but because emotional breath is not part of my natural skill.

194
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:47,752
Set, depending on if you're looking at companies and neuro diversity, as a part of your, your inclusion thinking about, how can you include people who have varying levels of neuro diversity, that don't allow them to inherently connect with the emotions, the emotional response and you know, it's not just a neuro diversity.

195
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:49,852
Also, as to how you were raised paying it?

196
00:38:49,852 --> 00:38:52,452
So what kind of experience you had in previous companies?

197
00:38:52,452 --> 00:38:56,952
It's what you are allowed to be and how you're allowed to show up in a previous workplace.

198
00:38:58,152 --> 00:39:05,052
There are people who believe compassion and empathy are just completely separate from your work life and that's something you might have in your personal life, but it worked.

199
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:09,952
It's like all business and so really defining what that means at your company.

200
00:39:09,952 --> 00:39:12,352
What does it mean to be a compassionate leader?

201
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:13,652
What does it mean to be human Centric?

202
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:18,352
What does it mean to be empathetic, whatever language you used to define that part of your Culture?

203
00:39:19,352 --> 00:39:30,052
Anyone, regardless of their, their personal proclivity is towards empathy and compassion can learn how to participate in your culture because you have defined it really clearly.

204
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:33,152
As we want to be, we talk about it.

205
00:39:33,152 --> 00:39:38,952
Always starts being human Centric, but it's not enough to say we're human Centric company of say this is what it means to be human Centric at or Easter.

206
00:39:39,352 --> 00:39:58,752
So whether you live your life in a way where you would describe yourself as being human Centric, you know what the expectations are here, and that's what you Teach people, you might not be able to teach them like how to be a compassionate person 24/7 in their lives, but you can tell them how to show up compassionately at work and teach them what that looks like.

207
00:40:00,952 --> 00:40:04,752
Well said, Bobby, did you have anything to add to that?

208
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:17,452
I do think it was well said we typically consider we sort of my background is in sync in Psychology and emotions, and we consider compassion to be an emotional response.

209
00:40:17,752 --> 00:40:23,352
Whereas empathy is the feeling of another's, kind of emotions.

210
00:40:24,152 --> 00:40:31,252
When we have empathy, we can then have compassion and so compassion is an emotional response with a desire to help.

211
00:40:31,552 --> 00:40:46,252
And, so I think It was well said that we might not necessarily be able to teach people how to have an emotional response, but we can in train within them the behaviors.

212
00:40:46,352 --> 00:40:59,752
And also at an organizational level policy wide set, the expectation that people should be behaving in a way that demonstrates compassion doesn't necessarily mean, they have to know what it is to behave in that way.

213
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:14,452
But when this happens you As a mentored respond in this way, you send them to this person or you provide them this resource or you work with them to overcome their goal or to overcome the challenge to their goal.

214
00:41:15,252 --> 00:41:24,152
There are all kinds of like work-related within the scope of control of the organization behaviors that we can do that are compassionate.

215
00:41:24,352 --> 00:41:29,652
Even if you know we don't necessarily have to get to the point where we're just having an emotional skill.

216
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:30,152
Training.

217
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:33,452
That notwithstanding is also something new A do.

218
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:36,552
But yeah, I think focusing on the behaviors is right.

219
00:41:38,052 --> 00:41:39,152
We have got another question.

220
00:41:39,152 --> 00:41:43,452
That's getting a vote voted right now, more and more.

221
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:51,552
I see companies measuring commitment, instead of Engagement curious, as to your thoughts on this alternative approach.

222
00:41:53,252 --> 00:41:56,052
Would you mind if I jump in here first?

223
00:41:56,552 --> 00:42:08,252
So that's a great question and actually, so I culture amp our engagement index the way that we measure engagement includes commitment as one of three components.

224
00:42:08,552 --> 00:42:13,652
So we measure engagement with five items two of which are around commitment.

225
00:42:13,852 --> 00:42:22,952
Now, that's important because in this, in this conceptualization, which is consistent, with all of the research and scientific literature on engagement.

226
00:42:25,652 --> 00:42:30,252
Commitment is one part of what it means for an employee to be engaged.

227
00:42:30,252 --> 00:42:33,352
They cannot be fully engaged unless they're committed.

228
00:42:33,352 --> 00:42:38,252
But there are also other things that indicate an employee is engaged.

229
00:42:38,252 --> 00:42:43,252
And commitment is necessary, but not completely sufficient.

230
00:42:43,252 --> 00:42:52,652
And so if you think about just measuring commitment, there are a hosts of reasons why someone might be committed Beyond Simple Beyond them.

231
00:42:53,052 --> 00:42:54,152
We enjoy their job.

232
00:42:54,152 --> 00:42:57,952
I might be committed here because I have nowhere else to go.

233
00:42:58,152 --> 00:43:01,352
We saw this pretty strongly at the beginning of the covid.

234
00:43:01,352 --> 00:43:15,652
Pandemic commitment increased because other organizations were laying people off or downsizing and people became they sheltered in place was I think the popular phrasing at that point.

235
00:43:15,652 --> 00:43:22,852
And so there are all these external factors, and they're all these sort of contaminating factors that might contribute to why someone has committed.

236
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:27,252
But it doesn't necessarily mean that they actually want to do a good job for you.

237
00:43:27,752 --> 00:43:43,552
So we continue to measure engagement because it considers commitment along with the emotional, Affinity or investment that people have for your company, or your organization are they proud to work there, are they motivated to go above and beyond and to the extent that they're engaged, they would tend to do.

238
00:43:43,552 --> 00:43:46,552
So, would they recommend you as a great place to work?

239
00:43:46,552 --> 00:43:50,152
Those are the kinds of things that would indicate that someone is committed to you.

240
00:43:50,152 --> 00:43:52,752
They want to be with you for the long term.

241
00:43:53,052 --> 00:43:56,552
And while they're there, they will want to do good work.

242
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:01,452
Those three questions I think are really key which would you mind it?

243
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:13,452
Would it be okay if you drop that in chat for us because those are very clear questions that we could be asking or you know serving out to gauge that commitment.

244
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:14,352
All right.

245
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:15,052
Thank you, Bobbi.

246
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:20,852
We actually have a couple minutes left, and so I do want to get through at least another question here.

247
00:44:21,852 --> 00:44:25,152
Let us go with the anonymous question.

248
00:44:25,152 --> 00:44:27,252
I have read that engagement.

249
00:44:27,452 --> 00:44:29,152
Is the bare minimum.

250
00:44:29,152 --> 00:44:31,052
You should expect from your employees.

251
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:36,252
Disengaged employees equals reduced ARR with this in mind.

252
00:44:36,252 --> 00:44:39,852
What are some benchmarks for an Engaged Workforce?

253
00:44:45,152 --> 00:44:46,652
I am not, I am not exactly sure.

254
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:59,352
What we talked about engagement is the bare minimum, you should expect from your employees, and not sure exactly what that is, referring to, maybe Bobby if you want to take this and it's benchmarks for an Engaged Workforce.

255
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:05,252
We look at things like our culture and thank you, Sherman scores, across a bunch of different categories.

256
00:45:05,252 --> 00:45:21,252
In addition to the primary engagement score as well as things like attrition and retention and There's a lot of factors that we look at around our Workforce but in terms of Engagement specifically, yeah.

257
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:23,552
Three seconds.

258
00:45:28,352 --> 00:45:34,252
I don't have a great answer for the beginning part around engagement, as being the bare minimum, you should expect from your employees.

259
00:45:34,252 --> 00:45:47,552
When I think, Potentially, I mean, so if you think about what we used to measure engagement, it's whether your employees are proud to work there, they would recommend you, they're committed to you, I almost would reverse it and say, I think engagement is the bare minimum.

260
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:52,152
You should expect from your employer that they should be engaging.

261
00:45:52,152 --> 00:45:58,452
You it's at least insofar as you believe that having an Engaged Workforce as a competitive Advantage.

262
00:45:58,552 --> 00:46:20,752
So if you want to be an employee or employer of choice, we go through this work because in we want to act upon aspects of our culture and Experience that drive that in emotional investment, that commitment from your employees, to get all the downstream benefits that we know the increased AR are the reduced turnover, the higher job, performance and productivity.

263
00:46:22,452 --> 00:46:23,052
Thank you.

264
00:46:23,252 --> 00:46:33,552
All right, I am going to squeeze in one question because this one's a good one, but keep it as fast as you can Kim and Bobby its release a hunter with a fully remote team.

265
00:46:33,552 --> 00:46:37,952
How do you cultivate team culture and facilitate staff?

266
00:46:37,952 --> 00:46:44,452
Getting to know each other outside of work focused meetings What does be a short answer?

267
00:46:46,152 --> 00:46:54,452
I think you have to recognize that the team culture is going to happen whether you're paying attention to it or not and that everything you do cultivates, your team culture.

268
00:46:54,452 --> 00:46:59,352
So, it's how you run your meetings is how you assign work, it's how you promote, its how you terminate.

269
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:06,252
It's like that is all culture is not just Gathering Together outside of work focused in meetings.

270
00:47:06,552 --> 00:47:09,552
So your team culture is part of your work, Focus meetings as well.

271
00:47:09,552 --> 00:47:10,752
You can't separate the two.

272
00:47:10,752 --> 00:47:12,552
I think that's first thing that people.

273
00:47:12,952 --> 00:47:17,752
Tends to where they pretend to kind of separate.

274
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:42,052
But in terms of people getting to know each other outside of work, Focus meetings, I think well one of the things we do is Affinity groups on slack and those groups we have a pets group and a parent's group and a we just have we have a new channel called social yell where the Only Rule that you have to type in all caps and it's great for just like shouting because we don't really encourage shouting in all caps in the rest of our Slack.

275
00:47:42,752 --> 00:48:03,052
But creating slack channels and creating opportunities for people to find their people, whether those people are near them or not, and then building in and a suggested mechanisms and letting people take it their way, we suggested something called Loom pen, pals.

276
00:48:03,352 --> 00:48:25,952
It's like you can connect with somebody on the other side of the world and you just send Loom videos back and forth to each other like Uncle pen pals, I am doing things like doughnut, social check, Enzyme just like brand name-dropping now, but people are the other thing to realize is the last thing I will say, is that people are going to experience the social side of Team culture, which I think is what you're talking about here.

277
00:48:25,952 --> 00:48:31,752
Lisa, they're going to want to experience that in different ways depending on how they like to show up at work.

278
00:48:31,752 --> 00:48:33,052
How introverted or extroverted?

279
00:48:33,052 --> 00:48:40,852
They are how passionate they are about their Hobbies, how much time they have to devote to kind of social things, outside of the regular work day.

280
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:54,452
And so not Adding any sort of expectation that every single employee must engage with X number of social chats, otherwise our team culture, sex and kind of removing those expectations and realizing that for some people.

281
00:48:54,752 --> 00:48:55,652
They feel totally.

282
00:48:55,652 --> 00:49:00,252
I am one of these people feeling totally Satisfied by the five minutes of social engagement.

283
00:49:00,252 --> 00:49:05,352
We do at the beginning of our team meetings, where we do a 5-minute social kind of check in with each other.

284
00:49:05,352 --> 00:49:12,552
At the beginning of our meetings, my brain is so busy with two little kids and full-time job and everything else going on in my life.

285
00:49:12,652 --> 00:49:16,752
I feel like I don't at this stage in my life and career, maybe it will be different six months from now.

286
00:49:16,952 --> 00:49:24,752
Like I don't personally feel the need to create extra social opportunities in my workday or outside of my working hours.

287
00:49:24,752 --> 00:49:25,352
Forget about it.

288
00:49:25,352 --> 00:49:29,852
I am like in full-time kid mode but I have like where I am in my life.

289
00:49:29,852 --> 00:49:33,252
I have this kind of cultivation outside of work largely.

290
00:49:33,652 --> 00:49:35,552
So I find ways to do it within my work.

291
00:49:35,752 --> 00:49:39,552
Other people on our team are really looking for that, social connection and are very active.

292
00:49:39,552 --> 00:49:47,252
In our pets channels and are meeting up when Traveling to take their pets on walks with other co-workers.

293
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:54,052
And so just, you really have to be flexible and inclusive of a lot of different styles of socializing.

294
00:49:54,752 --> 00:49:55,452
Love it.

295
00:49:55,652 --> 00:49:56,552
Not a short answer.

296
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,652
Thank you, Bobby.

297
00:50:00,352 --> 00:50:01,152
I agree.

298
00:50:01,552 --> 00:50:09,952
I won't belabor the point by going too much more in-depth but I do think that changing the nature of what that looks like.

299
00:50:10,052 --> 00:50:18,352
Depending on understanding that you have different audiences and abilities to be engaged with some of those outside of work meeting.

300
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:25,252
Social engagements is one of the best things that you can do to get more people involved in outside of work, meeting social engagements.

301
00:50:25,252 --> 00:50:30,952
So, at the beginning of covid, you know, that the virtual happy hours or something with All the Rage.

302
00:50:31,852 --> 00:51:13,852
But recognizing the fact that people who are at home, caregivers, working all day, trying to juggle both things, don't also have the, you know, the next hour or two after to spend, you know, doing a happy hour but recognizing that sometimes in those instances, when those informal connections are made and so standardizing, I think is a great idea, the fact that you're asking the question means that you're hoping to Sigh what that virtual culture looks like and standardizing it ensures that it's not left up to those like really informal, you know, informal Gatherings that some people can and can't make more consistently than others.

303
00:51:14,152 --> 00:51:32,352
For we're actually a lot of like the to take an extreme example where like you know, performance evaluations happen or promotions or made, you know when people are just find that they like each other because they shared a beer together means that I am going to Put you up for that promotion, or I am going to tell you about a career opportunity.

304
00:51:32,352 --> 00:51:40,652
I just saw in a different slack Channel but then not communicate that out more structured or more standardized in a one-on-one or a team meeting.

305
00:51:42,552 --> 00:51:43,252
That's great.

306
00:51:43,252 --> 00:51:44,452
Wow, thank you.

307
00:51:44,552 --> 00:51:46,052
There's so many notes.

308
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:52,352
The recording of This will be shared to everybody, so we're probably going to rewind this and watch some of these Key Parts.

309
00:51:52,352 --> 00:51:53,852
But Kim Bobby.

310
00:51:54,052 --> 00:52:03,552

00:52:05,652 --> 00:52:09,652

So, thank you so much.

314
00:52:11,052 --> 00:52:17,452
And with that corn Transition into our feng shui experience.

315
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:28,552
So I would like to introduce Suman who is the CEO and co-founder of Marco experiences to the stage and tell us a little bit about Marco.

316
00:52:28,552 --> 00:52:31,552
And you know what, we're going to go into today.

317
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:36,152
Well, I think it's pretty timely with Lisa's question just now actually.

318
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:40,052

319

So appreciate you facilitating that.

320
00:52:42,552 --> 00:52:45,152
Yeah, so I am assuming I am the CEO and co-founder of Marco.

321
00:52:45,952 --> 00:52:59,052
The problem we're solving is, it was just discussed, which is that the way we work and live, his kind of fundamentally changed, and while we have more flexibility, there's Now new challenges, which is how do I attract and retain the best talent.

322
00:52:59,052 --> 00:53:00,152
How do I create?

323
00:53:00,452 --> 00:53:07,652
Obviously culture is very complicated, but perhaps some of that, social fabric, fabric, around culture, and connection, and that's kind of the problem, we're solving.

324
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:12,152
So we do that through experiences virtual in-person multi-layered.

325
00:53:12,352 --> 00:53:16,352
It's, and then we help proactively kind of plan that partner with companies for that.

335
00:54:26,652 --> 00:54:28,152
Thank you so much for joining us.

336
00:54:28,752 --> 00:54:31,252
I wanted to ask you all before.

337
00:54:31,252 --> 00:54:38,152
I tell you all about the wonderful world of funk shui, how many of you have heard of Fung shui?

338
00:54:38,152 --> 00:54:38,852
Right?

339
00:54:38,952 --> 00:54:42,652
How many of you and just put it in the chat?

340
00:54:42,752 --> 00:54:43,352
Tell me.

341
00:54:43,352 --> 00:54:46,252
Yes or now if you have heard a function way.

342
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:48,652
I love that.

343
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:50,752
So Shelly saying yes Danielle.

344
00:54:50,752 --> 00:54:54,652
Yeah, so many people have, and I am So Lisa.

345
00:54:54,652 --> 00:54:56,252
Yes Mindy.

346
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:57,652
Okay, perfect.

347
00:54:58,652 --> 00:55:04,852
So I will tell those of you who might not be familiar with it a little bit about what it is.

348
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:14,552
But I am also going to tell you how I got into function y right, didn't just wake up one day and say, hmm shui.

349
00:55:14,852 --> 00:55:16,952
What I did was it's a little bit.

350
00:55:17,052 --> 00:55:18,852
Long story but it makes sense.

351
00:55:19,252 --> 00:55:28,952
So I worked in the New York City Art world for many years, and I started my own company that helps artists navigate the art world.

352
00:55:29,252 --> 00:55:34,452
And when I started this company, I ended up working out of my kitchen.

353
00:55:34,752 --> 00:55:42,352
I was in this tiny, New York City apartment, and we had a little Nook in the kitchen where I could work.

354
00:55:42,352 --> 00:55:45,052
And here's a picture of the meat in the kitchen.

355
00:55:45,052 --> 00:55:46,852
You see the room divider behind me?

356
00:55:46,952 --> 00:55:49,052
Behind that is like the stove.

357
00:55:50,152 --> 00:55:55,652
It was a true, you know, from the ground up in the kitchen moment.

358
00:55:56,352 --> 00:56:16,852
And when I did this, I Googled Fung shui, I wanted to have everything set up as nicely as possible, and once I really do deep into it, and set it up in a way where I was really activating as much good energy.

359
00:56:17,152 --> 00:56:35,252
Fung shui as possible, my business went full time, I got featured in major Publications and since then, I have been helping so many people work with the principles of feng shui to help them, take their business to the next level.

360
00:56:35,552 --> 00:56:59,652
And while this may not be fully, you know, conventional here in places like Asia, there are major corporations that higher Hire Consultants to double-check and actually guide them on the layout of their offices on the layout, for their Executives and their homes and everything.

361
00:57:00,352 --> 00:57:10,752
So, I wanted to ask you right now, if you could put in the chat, where are you guys working from right now?

362
00:57:11,252 --> 00:57:26,352
And as you could see right, as you could see, I am Not in my kitchen office anymore because the business worked and now I have a beautiful, big office and my desk is on the other side of the room.

363
00:57:26,552 --> 00:57:26,852
Okay.

364
00:57:26,852 --> 00:57:35,952
So we have Tara says, she's working from the kitchen table been there, done that Jenna says, in my or Gina, sorry, my home office.

365
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:37,952
Katie says my kitchen.

366
00:57:39,852 --> 00:57:43,852
Let us see one too, many dogs and husbands and here too.

367
00:57:44,552 --> 00:57:50,952
You know, dogs are actually wonderful for Feng shui because they hang out where the energy is good.

368
00:57:50,952 --> 00:57:56,152
So if you have got dogs hanging out near you this is a good thing.

369
00:57:56,152 --> 00:58:01,052
So we have someone working in their corporate office, which is wonderful.

370
00:58:01,052 --> 00:58:08,852
So if you say the office in San Francisco right by the bay gorgeous, I bet it's beautiful and Kenny says my office.

371
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,052
Chair has a loose screw.

372
00:58:10,052 --> 00:58:13,552
So I have been a victim to a living room and dining room table.

373
00:58:14,052 --> 00:58:14,852
Okay.

374
00:58:14,952 --> 00:58:15,252
All right.

375
00:58:15,252 --> 00:58:16,852
So we have some off.

376
00:58:17,052 --> 00:58:21,552
Says, in some sort of unconventional work from home situations, like Emily.

377
00:58:21,552 --> 00:58:30,552
She's sharing an office / bedroom with her work from home co-workers, who are her husband and her dog, isn't it?

378
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:33,352
Funny how much our dogs are?

379
00:58:33,352 --> 00:58:34,752
Just totally working.

380
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:36,452
Alongside us nowadays.

381
00:58:37,252 --> 00:58:39,452
Also tell me what kind of dog you have?

382
00:58:39,452 --> 00:58:46,652
If you have a dog because I absolutely, I am trying to get my dog to hop on here but I have a little pomeranian dog.

383
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:47,852
Who I would love to say hi to you.

384
00:58:47,852 --> 00:58:50,452
Well and caps.

385
00:58:50,452 --> 00:58:52,052
Yes! Jessica you have a cat.

386
00:58:52,852 --> 00:58:53,252
Okay.

387
00:58:53,252 --> 00:58:53,552
Gosh.

388
00:58:53,552 --> 00:58:55,252
It's a miniature schnauzer.

389
00:58:55,252 --> 00:58:56,152
I love this.

390
00:58:56,252 --> 00:59:09,752
Okay, so when you are working with Feng Shui, so many of you have heard a lot about this, there are three types of luck when it comes to function way, okay?

391
00:59:10,352 --> 00:59:15,452
And the types of lock are as follows, there's the lock that you're born with.

392
00:59:15,452 --> 00:59:22,152
So in our Kind of society, we think of maybe like our Karma or astrology.

393
00:59:22,452 --> 00:59:30,152
So, that's the luck that you're born with, and we can say that the lock that were born with because we live pretty much in the lap of luxury.

394
00:59:30,752 --> 00:59:34,652
I would say compare comparatively, it's pretty good.

395
00:59:34,952 --> 00:59:43,652
And then we have the lock that we create with our hard work and all of you I am sure are working very diligently.

396
00:59:43,852 --> 00:59:48,052
So you can say that you have a lot of luck that you bring in with your hard work.

397
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:52,952
Now the third type of Lock and mind you, all of these are divided evenly.

398
00:59:52,952 --> 00:59:59,152
So it's 1/3 the luck, you're born with 1/3 the luck that you create with your hard work.

399
00:59:59,152 --> 01:00:03,952
And then 1/3 the luck that funk shui brings you.

400
01:00:03,952 --> 01:00:09,552
So the luck that your environment brings you, the flow of energy and your environment.

401
01:00:09,552 --> 01:00:16,752
And so today I am going to share with you three small quick things that you can do too.

402
01:00:17,252 --> 01:00:21,852
Uplevel your space, right?

403
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,752
So let me get into it.

404
01:00:25,652 --> 01:00:28,052
Number one, okay?

405
01:00:28,352 --> 01:00:30,552
Is the power position.

406
01:00:30,552 --> 01:00:33,052
So where you are sitting, okay?

407
01:00:33,352 --> 01:00:39,352
So how many of you are sitting facing the wall where you are?

408
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:43,952
So if you're sitting facing the wall, put a number one in the chat.

409
01:00:44,952 --> 01:00:46,852
Okay, Sonic Christian lore.

410
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:49,052
Dana Caitlin.

411
01:00:49,152 --> 01:00:49,452
Okay.

412
01:00:49,452 --> 01:00:53,652
So many people are sitting facing the wall and you know what?

413
01:00:53,652 --> 01:00:57,452
When I first started I was also sitting facing the wall.

414
01:00:58,152 --> 01:01:07,252
I am going to tell you this really quick trick here and it's actually going to help with your engagement and your company, right?

415
01:01:07,252 --> 01:01:11,052
And it really helps with Employee Engagement because it helps you focus.

416
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:14,452
And that is sitting in the power position.

417
01:01:15,352 --> 01:01:24,152
So when you are sitting in the power position, what happens is you feel more powerful, you feel more focused.

418
01:01:24,252 --> 01:01:26,752
So you're asking me Marina, what is this power position?

419
01:01:26,752 --> 01:01:29,152
You're talking about, how do we get there?

420
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:44,552
So there is might have some illustrations pop up on the screen for you but basically when you are sitting not facing the wall and you have the door in sight so you're not sitting.

421
01:01:44,652 --> 01:02:02,652
Right in front of the door, we're going to have some not right, power positions but when you are sitting with the facing a wall or where you see the door, right, you're not directly in front of the door, but you see and it's not to the site side.

422
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:08,652
So Lori says, dead center of the room that's actually wonderful as long as you can see the door.

423
01:02:08,952 --> 01:02:16,752
And the reason for this is a little bit psychological but it's also very powerful when it comes to function way.

424
01:02:17,452 --> 01:02:23,052
So punctual actually goes back, many, many centuries, thousands of years actually.

425
01:02:23,352 --> 01:02:32,452
And originally, it was to find the right land, formations to bury Emperor's and China, a little Macabre.

426
01:02:32,452 --> 01:02:44,452
But today, it has evolved into amplifying, the lock, right in your life, in your relationships, and your health, and your business.

427
01:02:44,852 --> 01:02:54,752
And so when you are thinking about your space, think of yourself as the royalty in your home, okay?

428
01:02:55,252 --> 01:03:03,852
So if you are the Royal person in your home, whether you're the king, the queen Emperor, the empress or whatever, right?

429
01:03:03,952 --> 01:03:05,652
When you are doing that.

430
01:03:06,852 --> 01:03:16,652
You are in a power position and that Royal person would never sit in a way so that they do not see the door.

431
01:03:17,152 --> 01:03:20,452
What a king ever sit with their back to the door.

432
01:03:20,652 --> 01:03:28,452
If you think about it in movies, villains always sit with their back to the door and what happens to them, right?

433
01:03:28,452 --> 01:03:29,052
Okay.

434
01:03:29,152 --> 01:03:36,452
So we have someone's who's sitting facing so pakalana says she's facing the window.

435
01:03:36,552 --> 01:03:37,652
A door behind me.

436
01:03:38,052 --> 01:03:44,152
So I know it's beautiful to look at the window and it's actually great lighting to sit facing out the window.

437
01:03:44,552 --> 01:03:57,652
But, you know, when you're in Zoom but you really, when you are sitting there and you see the door, you, you are fully focused because let me show you what happens when you're not in a power position.

438
01:03:57,652 --> 01:04:18,952
So if we show you these illustrations, where you're sitting with your back to the door, what happens is you are on high alert and there is You know, your lizard brain your amygdala and no matter how safe you feel in your space, you are going to feel that in your subconscious.

439
01:04:18,952 --> 01:04:26,552
You're going to have these processes that are taking away your focus because they're going to be asking, hey, who's going to walk in?

440
01:04:26,552 --> 01:04:32,852
What if somebody walks into the door and it has nothing to do with how safe you feel in the space.

441
01:04:32,852 --> 01:04:38,852
It's truly something that is very Much instinctive and primitive and us.

442
01:04:39,052 --> 01:04:49,652
So when you sit with the Dorn site, it's so much better for you and when if you're interested and you know, I do these Marco experiences.

443
01:04:50,452 --> 01:04:56,752
When I do these Marco experiences, they're a little bit more intimate, right?

444
01:04:56,752 --> 01:04:59,452
We have, I could see where you're sitting.

445
01:04:59,452 --> 01:05:01,552
I could see your camera on.

446
01:05:01,852 --> 01:05:10,252
If you choose to show me that and in these Marco experiences, not only do I tell you, you know, all of these things.

447
01:05:10,252 --> 01:05:15,952
I also tell you what, your luckiest direction is for sitting and facing.

448
01:05:15,952 --> 01:05:26,852
And in the past, I have done this to one of my clients, my one-on-one punctuated clients, and she just got a new her.

449
01:05:26,852 --> 01:05:33,852
She worked for a real-estate company firm, and she was a realtor, and they just got a new office.

450
01:05:33,852 --> 01:05:35,652
And she asked me, Marina, where do I?

451
01:05:35,652 --> 01:05:36,252
Sit I can.

452
01:05:36,652 --> 01:05:44,852
And nice eat and not only did I pick a good seat for her so that she's in a power position.

453
01:05:44,952 --> 01:06:01,852
She was also facing one of her, lucky directions, and instantly, literally like the next day, somebody walked in off the street, and she made a huge million-dollar-plus sale in cash, instantly, right?

454
01:06:02,452 --> 01:06:05,852
Because that is how this stuff works.

455
01:06:05,852 --> 01:06:10,552
So if you're Interested to know what your true power position is.

456
01:06:10,852 --> 01:06:22,052
It would be really good if you booked it Marco experience, because then I could look at your space and tell you specifically where to sit and how to face.

457
01:06:22,452 --> 01:06:30,252
So, and I see, company says, window on wall closet, opposite wall, and the doors in a corner.

458
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:34,152
So, if you face the window, you are definitely with your back to the door.

459
01:06:34,552 --> 01:06:42,252
Yes, there is a Way, no matter how small your space is, my kitchen area, was Tiny.

460
01:06:43,052 --> 01:07:00,152
And I actually had maybe one want to say like two feet ahead of me because I insisted on sitting with my back to the wall and facing the entrance and seeing the entrance.

461
01:07:01,052 --> 01:07:13,752
So if you remember that promo shot in the very beginning where I have my diploma, Has with me that was in my kitchen office and I thought you could never tell because it was so nicely set up.

462
01:07:14,952 --> 01:07:17,552
It was like the previous promo shot.

463
01:07:17,752 --> 01:07:28,552
But anyway, so, before we go on, I just want to say it's also really important for you to have a chair that gives you support.

464
01:07:28,852 --> 01:07:39,252
So if you have a chair that has a higher back, the higher, the chair back the better, it is because A, if you are the royalty, you need a throne.

465
01:07:39,552 --> 01:07:46,852
So somebody earlier said that they had they were victim into the living room or the dining room.

466
01:07:46,852 --> 01:07:49,752
I can't remember because they had a screw loose on their chair.

467
01:07:50,152 --> 01:08:01,152
Make sure that your furniture is not wobbly and not loose because that gives you really, really good support, okay?

468
01:08:01,352 --> 01:08:05,652
And Kim is asking, are any tips on counteracting bad feng shui?

469
01:08:05,652 --> 01:08:12,152
If For example, you can't change the location of your desk or get a new chair.

470
01:08:12,552 --> 01:08:15,452
So yes and actually that's the third tips.

471
01:08:15,452 --> 01:08:27,952
I am going to go to it but generally speaking when you work with a practitioner what they can do is they can sort of fix this situation for you by carefully.

472
01:08:27,952 --> 01:08:35,452
Placing a mirror so that you do see the entrance from your desk, you just have to be very careful when you place this mirror.

473
01:08:36,452 --> 01:08:40,051
Cause you don't want to bounce the money energy back out.

474
01:08:40,051 --> 01:08:44,152
So that brings me to my next tip which is me replacement right here.

475
01:08:44,551 --> 01:08:51,952
So this I thought was so important to share with you Sonia.

476
01:08:51,952 --> 01:08:52,551
I love that.

477
01:08:52,551 --> 01:08:57,051
You say that you have to hide all the wires and that's why you face the wall.

478
01:08:58,452 --> 01:08:59,352
Here's the thing.

479
01:08:59,352 --> 01:09:06,252
When you were sitting with your back to the wall, first of all, you can put the wires in a box or something like that.

480
01:09:06,452 --> 01:09:12,452
When you're sitting with your back to the wall and you see your whole space in front of you, you will feel so much more powerful.

481
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:16,952
You will feel so much more open and more motivated to doing your work.

482
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:18,152
So give it a whirl.

483
01:09:18,652 --> 01:09:26,652
So back to me replacement, I thought this was super important to share with you because I actually had someone who hired me.

484
01:09:26,652 --> 01:09:32,952
They couldn't find a job for like a year and it was terrible in the moment that I walk into their space.

485
01:09:33,152 --> 01:09:36,252
I see a long hallway and at the end of the hallway, there's a mirror.

486
01:09:36,352 --> 01:09:41,452
And that mirror, what it was doing, it was reflecting all the energy back out the front door.

487
01:09:41,652 --> 01:09:53,051
So mirrors, actually double the energy, and they double the, the they double and direct the energy.

488
01:09:53,051 --> 01:10:00,552
So, here we have some illustrations of how you should Place mirror, so that they're not reflecting the door.

489
01:10:00,552 --> 01:10:15,052
And so you see those two on top, it's really good to have a mirror in your dining room because it actually doubles the energy of food and people and abundance, right?

490
01:10:15,052 --> 01:10:19,552
And in your workspace if you have a mirror that's adjacent to the door.

491
01:10:19,552 --> 01:10:24,952
So, if the mirrors shares a wall with the door, right?

492
01:10:26,252 --> 01:10:36,252
It's actually really good for you because it will double the energy that comes in and it also doubles the energy you have, right?

493
01:10:37,052 --> 01:10:39,452
So why am is asking me here?

494
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:40,252
Can a mirror?

495
01:10:40,252 --> 01:10:42,052
Reflect window?

496
01:10:42,952 --> 01:10:44,552
Yes, it can.

497
01:10:44,652 --> 01:10:49,752
You just want to make sure that it's not fully in front of the window?

498
01:10:49,752 --> 01:10:57,052
It's a little bit off to the side so it's not fully lined up with the window but it's not the end of the world.

499
01:10:57,152 --> 01:11:10,652
If it is most important thing is that it doesn't reflect the front door not opposite a doorway that it's not at the end of Long hallway and it's not reflecting a toilet.

500
01:11:11,052 --> 01:11:11,652
Okay.

501
01:11:11,652 --> 01:11:13,152
So a lot of us have a mirror.

502
01:11:13,152 --> 01:11:14,652
Right outside, the bathroom.

503
01:11:14,952 --> 01:11:18,152
You don't need that mirror.

504
01:11:18,152 --> 01:11:18,952
There move it.

505
01:11:18,952 --> 01:11:22,652
So it doesn't reflect the door.

506
01:11:23,652 --> 01:11:27,752
So and I have so many good questions in the chat that I really want to answer.

507
01:11:27,752 --> 01:11:35,152
Maybe we can open up a lounge after and I can get to it and use of the saying, how about facing?

508
01:11:35,752 --> 01:11:36,052
Yes.

509
01:11:36,052 --> 01:11:36,352
We will get.

510
01:11:36,452 --> 01:11:39,352
Get to those questions later, they're so good.

511
01:11:39,852 --> 01:11:50,152
So when I do a Marco experience because you can have your camera on, I can really guide you when it comes to the mirror placement.

512
01:11:50,252 --> 01:12:03,752
So if you are really, really curious about how you're sitting or what your mirror placement as that is one way that I can help you really pinpoint this right now.

513
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:12,952
The final thing that I want to share with you today Is called a salt cure and before we bring it up on the screen, or okay, we will make it up on the screen.

514
01:12:13,652 --> 01:12:15,552
I want to tell you what this is for.

515
01:12:15,952 --> 01:12:29,152
So when I practice Fung shui, I practice classical Chinese Funk shui and you're actually going to see if you Google Fung shui, there's a very generalized layout of every space.

516
01:12:29,152 --> 01:12:36,052
It's called a bagua and it's incorrect because it's too General, right?

517
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:48,852
So when you place a salt cure, it's something that classical Chinese feng shui practitioners often do because they take away the negative energy in a room.

518
01:12:48,852 --> 01:12:53,552
How many of you walked into a room and felt like it was icky, right?

519
01:12:53,552 --> 01:12:59,152
Just put a 1 in the chat if you felt into a room or space in your like oh okay.

520
01:12:59,152 --> 01:13:01,052
So many people are missing one good.

521
01:13:01,552 --> 01:13:12,452
So what you do is you put together this glass, Jar with Nolan with a wide neck and this would be a salt cure.

522
01:13:12,452 --> 01:13:21,752
So, look at this illustration here, you're going to fill it up about 70% with salt right?

523
01:13:21,752 --> 01:13:28,652
And has to be just salt, not, you know, Jane's, crazy salt mix, right with all the other stuff in it.

524
01:13:28,852 --> 01:13:30,452
So fill it up with salt.

525
01:13:30,552 --> 01:13:36,352
Put 6 coins in a circle around it, then put it on 90%.

526
01:13:37,352 --> 01:13:51,752
Put fill it up, 90% with water so it doesn't touch the top against a little bit open and you want to put it on a platform that you can just toss out later because what this salt cure is going to do, it's going to crystallize.

527
01:13:51,752 --> 01:13:56,552
How many of you remember the science project without the coins, right?

528
01:13:56,552 --> 01:14:01,252
Like how many of you remember doing something like this and science class?

529
01:14:01,252 --> 01:14:02,452
Yes, Amanda.

530
01:14:02,452 --> 01:14:10,652
I knew somebody would because I sure did so You do this, you're going to leave this in a corner of the room.

531
01:14:10,652 --> 01:14:11,452
You're going to let it breathe.

532
01:14:11,452 --> 01:14:19,452
You can put it on top of the bookshelf, so it's out of you and you're going to let it crystallized and make sure it's like on a magazine or something.

533
01:14:19,452 --> 01:14:25,652
So that it, you know, when the salt crusts up, you could just take the whole magazine and throw it out.

534
01:14:25,652 --> 01:14:43,352
As a matter of fact, you have just put a plastic paper bag, over your hand, grab it and toss it out because it will have so much negative energy in it, then it will suck out from the room and it will actually make the room feel better.

535
01:14:43,652 --> 01:14:58,152
I have done this in, you know, full disclosure, I have friends who were bickering and I said to my friend, I was like, you need to put a salt cure in your bedroom just right now.

536
01:14:58,152 --> 01:15:03,252
And so she did this and her husband stop bickering, which was great.

537
01:15:03,352 --> 01:15:10,452
So how often do you have to do this natyam I would say do this at the very minimum, right?

538
01:15:10,452 --> 01:15:15,652
I mean, if you're going to be really intense about it, you could do it every month or whenever you feel weird.

539
01:15:16,052 --> 01:15:20,952
I would say just do it once when you move into a place, right?

540
01:15:20,952 --> 01:15:32,252
Or you could even do it once a year, but the energy and Funk shui, it, changes annually, monthly daily hourly, right?

541
01:15:32,452 --> 01:15:36,252
The salt cure takes a really long time to cry.

542
01:15:36,352 --> 01:15:39,252
Sometimes Crystallized it will crystallize into days.

543
01:15:39,252 --> 01:15:44,252
Sometimes it will take two weeks, depends on how much energy is in there.

544
01:15:44,952 --> 01:15:57,552
So make sure most important thing is that you keep the lid off and you do not touch it when you toss it out and ym is asking, do you need to do the salt cure?

545
01:15:57,552 --> 01:15:58,252
Peru more?

546
01:15:58,252 --> 01:15:58,652
Is it okay?

547
01:15:58,652 --> 01:16:00,852
For the whole home, right?

548
01:16:00,952 --> 01:16:02,952
It depends on the layout of your home.

549
01:16:04,052 --> 01:16:14,352
If just to be fully safe, Do it for the rooms where you spend the most time and especially in the center of the home this year.

550
01:16:14,352 --> 01:16:27,752
Especially if you have like an open floor plan in the center of your home is fully open because the energy those here in the center is not so good, it's actually more energy.

551
01:16:27,752 --> 01:16:32,052
So it's kind of interesting that there's a war happening this year, like a big one.

552
01:16:32,952 --> 01:16:36,452
But anyway, we don't need to get into that right now.

553
01:16:36,652 --> 01:16:38,752
