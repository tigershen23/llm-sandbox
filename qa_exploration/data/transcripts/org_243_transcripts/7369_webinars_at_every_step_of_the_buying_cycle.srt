00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,800

16
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,900
But before we jump in to, to the topic, how are you doing?

17
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,000
Where are you tuning in from?

18
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,300
And how are you thinking about 20-23?

19
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,900
How are you doing?

20
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,700
Well, based in Boston, Massachusetts, which is nice company HQ as well.

21
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,600
So it's a little chilly kicking off this year, but hitting the ground running.

22
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:12,300
I already have a lot of the webinar calendar planned, which is great to see and have a great team behind me to support in that promotion and production.

23
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,200
That's awesome.

24
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,400
All right.

25
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,600
Well, we can jump right into.

26
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,600
So, what I hear is that 70% of your pipeline, that's generated.

27
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,800
That's marketing generated right now of that webinars.

28
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,800
Is a huge influence of your pipeline?

29
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,800
What percentage would you say or?

30
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
I don't know if you can quantify that.

31
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,700
Yeah, I would say right now with first touch.

32
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:47,800
So we identify a lot of our marketing Performance Based on that first touch.

33
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:58,700
I would say it's about, you know, 15 to 20 percent of that overall, 70%, give or take on the seasonality, right?

34
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:22,700
We all see that there's A lot of (webinar) for Teague in various parts of the Year, especially the summertime is a lot of (webinar) fatigue, but we're starting to see that ramp up a little bit more, but there's a lot of influence with webinars and our existing database continues to attend multiple webinars.

35
00:07:22,700 --> 00:08:11,000
Which is why it's really important for us to think about our topics that are timely and at what buying stage, that they're apart of, and I have been in the marketing field for over seven years now, working in marketing agency, working at a consulting firm and something, always ties back to those Live Events, but if you're smart about it, and I think we're seeing that Lay out here at tulip a lot as I kind of ramped up our webinar program and made it a sustainable program that creates you know, high quality content for our sales reps.

36
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,800
But also thinking about our personas right?

37
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We want to make sure that they're attending an event that's going to create insights or leave insights with them to be able to use those insights tomorrow and their day-to-day I love that, and I am excited because in our conversation today, we're going to unpack a little bit more of everything that you just touched.

38
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,200
But before we jump into that we do have a quick poll.

39
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:50,300
So let us pull that up real fast and just get a feel for how many of you actually two different Bolt.

40
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,500
The other one Sal.

41
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,400
So we have got our amazing producer.

42
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,100
Hey Sal.

43
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,300
He's a dark green room.

44
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,800
If you can pull the other one, there we go.

45
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,600
All right.

46
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,500
Do you use webinars as a key channel?

47
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,300
In your marketing mix today?

48
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:16,100
So feel free to drop your votes in there and give us a sense of how many of you are using this channel to actually drive your pipeline.

49
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,800
Wow, okay.

50
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
All the time.

51
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,700
Got a couple of votes and let us see if there's any other ones.

52
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,200
But okay cool.

53
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,000
Well, we have got folks that are very familiar with Averaging webinars.

54
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:40,100
I actually don't see a ton of folks who have, you know, maybe leveraged it as frequently, as, as you have Megan, or even as we have here.

55
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,900
So, okay, here and there, we have got another boat that cave in.

56
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,200
So okay, great.

57
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, that gives us a pulse and understanding of, you know, we got a lot of folks here that are pretty Savvy.

58
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,600
Probably with the power of what webinars can drive.

59
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,900
Before we jump into our conversation on that though.

60
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:13,300
Meghan, I would love to hear about your story and how you got into B2B marketing, can you take us back into your memory lane?

61
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,300
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

62
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:27,600
So actually got dual degree in public relations and marketing and, you know, I kind of jumped right into the agency.

63
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:37,200
Working at a full funnel demand, generation agency, based in Burlington Vermont, HubSpot agencies.

64
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:45,400
So I grew to, you know, own client base of, you know, around 13 clients at a time.

65
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:57,600
And we focus on any kind of demand generation strategy from the top of the funnel, all the way to, you know, sales enablement.

66
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:08,300
At the bottom of the funnel, even the systems integration in between you know Revenue operations ensuring that there's marketing and sales alignment from a systems perspective.

67
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:37,700
But also from a, you know, go to market and campaign strategy perspective and took some time as well working at IT consulting firm as a, you know, marketing lead identifying Membership program for certain members in the organization at that consulting firm, but then really love the agency life.

68
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:49,500
So I kind of went back to the agency locally, managed accounts again for a little bit, with a little bit of time and it's, I loved it.

69
00:11:49,500 --> 00:12:14,000
I think especially as a marketing professional, if you can dip your toes into agency, See life, you learn so much and that was going to be, you know what of, what of my advice notes is, you know, the B2B marketing Community is so close-knit and the connections, are you gain or pretty much career long?

70
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,700
And I did see that at the agency that I worked with, you know, with my clients, with my peers, I am Facebook friends with the, a few of them.

71
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,400
So it's, it's been a really great experience so far.

72
00:12:27,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Um, and then, you know, I decided to take, I wanted to just have one client of my own and that's where I found an opportunity at tulip interfaces where I was the first demand generation manager and then grew to, you know, lead a team of demand gen folks and one of our core tactics and our overall integrated campaign strategies webinars there webinars, and we went from running around for webinars a year to I believe we ended the year at 20 webinars, all from large-scale webinars to you know smaller scale more intimate settings.

73
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,800
Wow.

74
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,500
Okay.

75
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, first thanks for walking us through your, your path, your journey that's noted on the agency advice tip that you're putting out there, I actually come from an agency background as well, but more so B to C.

76
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:38,100
So it looks like an inch at she mentioned that she also came from a HubSpot agency.

77
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:44,900
So there's a ton that you can learn in agency life so that's great to hear.

78
00:13:46,100 --> 00:14:00,500
So jumping into what your career you that the number you just mentioned, you said, you know, you started with doing for webinars at tulip and then last year you ended at doing 20, what was it?

79
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,100
21 webinar.

80
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:09,600
Yeah, I think we ended officially at 20, a big increase in webinar production.

81
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,100
And it was kind of testing period, right?

82
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:21,000
We saw some success and 2021 with just a few webinars and wanted to ramp it up and see, you know what?

83
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,700
Topics are resonating and relevant with our Target.

84
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,900
Personas, we do what our Target.

85
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,800
Personas want to learn more about, and what are their kind of watering holes?

86
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:44,900
And our, our platform is targeted for manufacturers Global manufacturers, whether its life sciences General Manufacturing.

87
00:14:45,800 --> 00:15:01,200
Almost any company that, you know, manufacturers, our product will benefit from our platform and that industry is kind of Delayed in terms of they're progressing and you know where they look for Content.

88
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:13,900
So some of it is still in person events and trade shows and, you know, now we're seeing that increase in and attending online events, mainly webinars.

89
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,300
Gotcha.

90
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,900
So give us a little snapshot of who your ICP is.

91
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,000
And you know what?

92
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,900
What are their interests in your webinars?

93
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:24,700
Yeah.

94
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah.

95
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,800
Absolutely.

96
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,000
So like I mentioned were global company.

97
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:43,600
So we our customer database as you know, ranging from, you know, manufacturers based in the United Kingdom to India United States.

98
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:53,800
And we generally look for larger manufacturers that have multiple manufacturing plants so it is something to consider when we're targeting.

99
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:02,200
Certain people on LinkedIn is we do you know consider their company size and then you know the who is really important for us.

100
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:10,000
So we're targeting, and we usually have successful sales conversations with those operations leaders.

101
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:19,700
So manufacturing operations director that manages a few manufacturing sites that's experiencing certain pains like production efficiency.

102
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,700
You know they're not creating enough of a specific product in a certain period of time.

103
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,100
Time to be able to meet demands.

104
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:40,300
Additionally, you know, they might be experiencing some product defects and not know why or where in the entire assembly line that they're experiencing that's causing that effect.

105
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:54,700
So our Solutions help improve, you know, production efficiency you know decrease the number of defects and identify those root causes of you know issues.

106
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,700
And the assembly line.

107
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,200
So where we want to create content especially at the top of the funnel.

108
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:10,599
When people don't know much about tulip is, we want to focus on those pains and how people can solve those pains today.

109
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:25,000
So we might not get directly into, you know, tulip as a solution, but we identify blueprints with, you know, their current Manufacturing tech stack or their Current.

110
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:41,300
If they only use paper to you know track production, we provide insights that they can Implement tomorrow or start thinking about change management or start evaluating what their Manufacturing tech stack should look like.

111
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,800
You know, it's important to be really relevant.

112
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,600
I mean what you're seeing today is a lot of issues and supply chain.

113
00:17:50,800 --> 00:18:15,000
There's a lot of issues in Workforce transformation, you know people are You know, back when you know covid-19 an all-time high, you know people were retiring older more, you know seasoned workers on the assembly line that had tribal knowledge about, you know, how to assemble certain products and rolls behind it.

114
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,200
They were retiring and a younger more digital first.

115
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,400
You know, Workforce is coming in.

116
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,600
You know, how do you navigate that in?

117
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,000
And today's era.

118
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:34,900
So you know, it's really important to really understand where our personas are coming from what their daily challenges are.

119
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:54,700
And, you know, for just about all of our webinars, we, you know, talk about tulip as a potential solution towards the end of the webinar, once they, you know, see the why, you know, we're relating to them, you know, we have a lot of people at tulip that work.

120
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,800
In the manufacturing industry, which is why they wanted to work for a solution like tulip.

121
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:12,300
And I think it's really important to understand the Persona and maintain that Persona driven architecture, through throughout any content.

122
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,400
You create not just webinars.

123
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:31,800
Persona driven architecture that sounds like a real II love that articulation of, you know, the Each and optimization of the buyers journey is kind of like, also, like, how I see it too but can you walk us through?

124
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:40,700
Even just the process of how you were able to architect that for your personas and really identify?

125
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:50,900
Okay, these are the type of webinars that we're going to do top of funnel middle of funnel, bottom of the funnel, and why could you just walk us through your process?

126
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,400
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

127
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,200
So I went in a little bit into that top A funnel.

128
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:26,500
So thinking about what trends are happening right now, what's going on in the news that's affecting, you know, an operations leader today and really discussing those Trends and ways that you can adjust your operations, today really gets the attention of our personas because we're not, we're not pushing our product, you know, we're really just talking about the Core issues happening today.

129
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:40,900
Well for those that you know about tulip and know that they need a solution like tulip or there's a gap right now, and they're Manufacturing tech stack where we like to focus our middle of the funnel pieces.

130
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,500
Of content are more tailored.

131
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,800
We call use cases.

132
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:53,600
So a big challenge with manufacturers today is efficient traceability.

133
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,400
So being All to identify the and Trace.

134
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Everything from the raw materials to the form the suppliers, all the way through to those finish completed products.

135
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:27,300
People are having issues, you know, there are identifying those defects or there's a, you know, there's something missing that leaded that led to, you know, something being recalled, which is a huge, huge issue for big Brands because you show up on the FDA website for five years.

136
00:21:27,300 --> 00:22:07,500
I think saying that, you know, you had a product that went out that was recalled and being able to efficiently Trace those Raw materials, the Assembly of products to, you know, ultimately you know, out to the wholesaler is really important for certain individuals and even those plant managers, so getting taking deeper dives into those specific use cases is has been, you know, really beneficial for us for people to know, you know, how we solve for those specific use cases, but also it gives it a more.

137
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,500
To its setting.

138
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:21,900
So we get a lot of Engagement in our, our chat throughout the webinars, and we especially for some of those topics, you know, it hits home for some folks.

139
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:30,800
So they talk a lot about in the chat and you sometimes know our subject matter experts to go off script which is something that, you know, I even encourage.

140
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:47,900
You know, I think it's everyone's human and it's nice to you know, have that You know, sometimes like emotional communication through chat, you know, similar to this platform, we have the Emojis.

141
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:55,300
So you see, if, you know, people get angry at a certain, you know, controversial topic within manufacturing.

142
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,400
You kind of see those emotions right there.

143
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,200
But, you know, that's what we want to encourage.

144
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
We want to correct encourage that discussion.

145
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,400
Mmm, I gotta ask.

146
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,900
What platform are you using today?

147
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,400
So where are you?

148
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,700
We're using live storm.

149
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,500
Okay, gotcha.

150
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,700
So that does encourage then the Emoji engagement, all that stuff.

151
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,200
Okay.

152
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,000
God I gotta know.

153
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:26,000
And then what do you find as far as the average number of registrants to attendees?

154
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,400
Does that vary from top of funnel middle of the final bottom of the funnel?

155
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:48,200
Yes I would say for registration number you know for those mo-more top of funnel webinars and you know Live Events we do see a higher registration count but with that, you know, we do see a lower attendance rate which is okay.

156
00:23:48,200 --> 00:24:00,200
You know, I think it's important to you know edit it down a little bit and have a nice on-demand webinar for people to access.

157
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:20,200
You know, I Can, you know, I even register for a lot of webinars and I either forget or, you know, a tense and watch kind of while I am well, I am working or watch On Demand or catch myself, you know, watching halfway through or, you know, everyone's super busy.

158
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:31,300
So, sometimes I have to hop off early because I have meetings, but usually we see for those top funnel webinars around a thirty percent attendance rate.

159
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:38,600
Were you know, continuing to engage those registrants to get them to attend the live event?

160
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,900
But we're also really tracking heavily those watches after.

161
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:49,800
So those that are watching on demand, and we even have that as our its own source when reporting.

162
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:56,900
Because a lot of people watch webinars On Demand, they're just, they just rather watch videos and maybe ask questions later.

163
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:24,800
So, and then for the middle of the funnel webinars, we do see like A lower registration rate because it's a little bit more tailored and more Niche, but a higher attendance rate, so closer to, you know, 50% attendance rate, and a lot of chats, a lot of chats during the so encouraging, that continued discussion even through the chat, especially for those middle of the funnel webinars.

164
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,800
Gotcha.

165
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,000
And then do you have any bottom of funnel webinars?

166
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Like I guess I will be more like demos Riot.

167
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,900
So we actually we just towards the end of this calendar year.

168
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:52,100
We had a it was actually a just a live event on YouTube, so we encourage registrations just to get those so you can get those reminders, right?

169
00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:01,100
But it was actually an open event and it was called the Tulip showcase and it featured a lot of our product releases.

170
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:09,100
And then towards the end of the day of the event, we featured a few customers and what we call the groundbreaker award.

171
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:24,300
So, those true champions of our platform where nominated by either customer success managers or their own peers within a customer company, and we presented Awards to them so, that's awesome.

172
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:46,200
Yeah, it's um, Thing that we do it you know the first time we tested it and I think as we continue to evolve our webinar program and you know live event program it's we test you know what might work and this is something that was really successful.

173
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,600
So hoping to do that, you know.

174
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:55,300
Probably two times a year because a lot goes into, you know, recording those demos.

175
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:03,700
And, you know, hearing from those customers dominating those customers, but it's good to really great to see that success.

176
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
I love that.

177
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,100
That's great to hear.

178
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:16,800
And in fact could you walk us through just the event types that you have from top of funnel middle and then bottom?

179
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,200
Because that's a great example.

180
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,200
Of what somebody could do for a bottom of the funnel type of event.

181
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:28,400
And I know you have mentioned at the top of funnel, it's more awareness Trends, things like that.

182
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:41,800
But even with your industry, could you just give us some like topical Hands-On examples, what types of events you do, and we can start with top of funnel and then work on, yeah, yeah for sure.

183
00:27:42,800 --> 00:28:07,900
So some of the examples of our top of funnel webinars, So the beginning of last year we kicked off the year with kind of you know con little bit of edginess in the title in our in the manufacturing industry there are larger systems compared to, you know, start up, you know, platform like tulip.

184
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:23,500
There's these manufacturing execution systems that have been around for so many years, and we, you know, challenged Relevancy of those types of systems and it generated a lot of interest.

185
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:38,500
So talking about the challenges today of people that have a legacy or traditional manufacturing execution system and, you know, predictions for this, you know, for 2022 because we did in the beginning of last year.

186
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:50,900
So that was one of our big top of funnel webinars and to kind of Pull It fulls circle where we're actually in a couple weeks.

187
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,900
We are running a related top of funnel webinar.

188
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,000
That's, you know, still kind of challenging manufacturing execution systems today.

189
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:07,000
Revisiting those predictions that we made last year we write.

190
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:24,700
And, you know, noting some of the either the continued trends that we're seeing as well as, you know, new trends for manufacturers to Consider when you know, optimizing their operation strategy.

191
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:37,300
So those are two top of funnel vents that, you know, one is happening in a couple weeks that we're really excited about and another type of funnel event.

192
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:57,300
It's, you know, more geared to those that are you know evaluating either their current Tech stack or you know really He will experience those pains and potentially identifying budget for, you know, a solution that might fit their needs.

193
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:08,000
So it was almost kind of buyer's guide, you know, key considerations, when evaluating your Manufacturing tech stack or a manufacturing execution system.

194
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:19,900
So, and I think for some of those type of funnel events where it's like it's focused around evaluating a system, the time Is super important.

195
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:26,000
So either, you know, towards the beginning of the year, when maybe budget has been approved, baby budget has been cut.

196
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,400
So you have to really think smarter not harder with your budget.

197
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:36,300
So it's something also to consider when identifying topics and your webinar calendar is.

198
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,400
What's timely right now?

199
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,200
What are your target personas considering right now?

200
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,000
It's top of mind and that's why we usually do.

201
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,000
Everyone does kind of Trends, peace.

202
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,400
But a little spin on.

203
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,900
You know what?

204
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,400
What's in your Tech stack right now and should you be re-evaluating it?

205
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,100
That's good.

206
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
So, that's top of funnel.

207
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,300
That's a funnel.

208
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,200
Yep, middle.

209
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,700
What kind of event types, you have?

210
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,600
Yeah.

211
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,700
Yeah, absolutely.

212
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,700
So we did have the, the traceability webinar.

213
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,600
So that was how to make traceability your competitive Advantage.

214
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Not your burden.

215
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,900
You know, people especially with compliance audits people just consider our manufacturers.

216
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:30,600
Sometimes, you know, they think about traceability as just a compliance check box when in reality, It can be a competitive Advantage.

217
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,900
It can base on what your tracking, you can automate it and it can be.

218
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,100
It can provide you insights and how you plan ahead not look back.

219
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:58,200
So that proactive and almost like predictive insights that you can gather from, you know what you're tracking and tracing on the manufacturing floor.

220
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:06,300
Or is its kind of we, what we wanted to do is really have a spin on, you know.

221
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:17,000
This doesn't have to be something that pains you every day, you know, it's actually something that can help you be more proactive and scale your manufacturing operations.

222
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,400
Yeah, so that's one example.

223
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:34,400
We also have been, we're actually planning an event with some of our integration partners and focused on.

224
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,100
So that's going to be more, you know, middle of the funnel.

225
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:48,400
So, you know, we integrate with AWS Microsoft, which is something that like manufacturers really use and their Stack.

226
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:56,900
So doing more silver round table with some of our integration Partners like Microsoft like AWS.

227
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,500
That's something that we are planning and really excited about to.

228
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:09,000
So not only thinking about we what we did in the past but new ways to lead a conversation.

229
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,300
That's awesome.

230
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:12,800
Okay.

231
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:24,200
And then the bottom of the funnel event ideas that you mentioned were like the award nomination ceremonies are there any other ideas for bottom of the funnel events?

232
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:32,400
Yeah, so we are kind of going along with the use case Niche topics.

233
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:38,100
We do want to, you know, do more live, demo experiences.

234
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,100
It's not something that we have tested yet.

235
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:47,200
Yet, you know, a live demo, where someone can, you know, it's in a webinar platform.

236
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:57,500
We usually, you know, maintain our webinars as videos or when people are ready to have a conversation with us.

237
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,100
Because our tool our platform is, is a really large platform.

238
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:10,300
So, we want to tailor a trial or a demo to fit their exact needs.

239
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,699
That is something that we do want to test, and I really want to plan for that is based on one use case.

240
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,699
Here's how you can utilize tool.

241
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:23,900
Appears the different ways that you can create an application in the platform.

242
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,300
That's great.

243
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,600
Yeah, all right.

244
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,900
Well, we have got a question here in Q&A.

245
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:43,100
You can pull that up do you find yourself using several different platforms for different kinds of events?

246
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,199
Getting Clips out after and getting data and results?

247
00:34:48,600 --> 00:35:01,500
Yeah, so right now for webinars, we have actually, we used to use it for our virtual events that have multiple sessions, we would test out a platform and it wouldn't work out.

248
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,900
So we for our webinars, you know, we do like live.

249
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,800
ERM it, our marketing operations person on our team.

250
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,600
He built out and infrastructure to be able to, you know, it's not a direct integration.

251
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:27,000
But it does connect through zapier into Marketo, which is our marketing automation platform.

252
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:36,200
But I think with a lot of our systems that we have today, it does lead to exporting data and importing data.

253
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:43,000
And some spreadsheets which is you know something that we don't have to navigate daily.

254
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,800
So I do find myself and some different platforms and exporting.

255
00:35:51,100 --> 00:36:00,400
Hoping to improve that soon but sometimes it's good to get into spreadsheets every now and then but yeah.

256
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,300
And then what about your on-demand content?

257
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,100
How are you guys handling On Demand right now?

258
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:20,700
Yeah so we have a multimedia producer that we sent our webinar you know files to, and he cleans it up slightly, and we have all of our on demand.

259
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:26,400
Webinars on our website so people can fill out a form and be able to access it.

260
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:46,400
We what we're starting to do now is Put our webinars into more bite-sized pieces of content as well as chapters so people can click right to you know a section that they wanted to focus on almost like when they're downloading an e-book.

261
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,200
You know the table of contents should have a shortcut that leaves you.

262
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,000
No right to that section especially if it's a big white paper.

263
00:36:53,400 --> 00:37:03,700
So we want to make that experience the same as we do, you know, with our ebooks is being able to, you know, get to the, you know.

264
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:10,800
One just watch 10 minutes of you know when we talk about a specific customer case study, then they can do that.

265
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,600
That's awesome.

266
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,700
So this would be on the landing page of where you house the on-demand video.

267
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,600
You actually also have other offers you include.

268
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:19,900
Yes.

269
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,600
Yeah.

270
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:41,100
It's, and they're all single in that specific on demand video, you know, they can jump to the section that they want to listen to In Depth because you know, who has time today and I feel like everyone's attention span is, you know, just getting smaller and smaller.

271
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:57,900
So, so give them the tools to, you know, absorb content quickly and easily, so they can, you know, learn from it and get back to their day or hopefully continue to navigate through our content, but it's good.

272
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,500
So big question.

273
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:08,700
I have next is around promotions and driving registration and attendance to all of your events.

274
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,600
What are some of the key strategies?

275
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,900
Jeez, that you are finding effective to drive registration across the funnel.

276
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,000
Absolutely.

277
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,600
So we have a set of standard promotional tactics that we run.

278
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:33,400
We're always going to navigate to our database especially for those middle of the funnel webinars or for the top of funnel webinars.

279
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,000
If people are unengaged, how can we re-engage them?

280
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:44,100
Almost consider them a top of funnel lead, even if they have had a conversation with sales and it's been, you know, for months.

281
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,900
So our database This is really important to, you know, send those promotions to and engaging way.

282
00:38:51,500 --> 00:39:00,400
We also utilize LinkedIn, LinkedIn ads with the LinkedIn lead gen form, especially for those top of funnel webinars.

283
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:08,200
It's kind of lower barrier to entry especially like with the LinkedIn Legion form and you can be extremely targeted.

284
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:15,200
So we can Target certain industries, certain job functions within those Industries.

285
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,100
You know, make sure we're excluding you Competitors.

286
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,400
Or those that might not be a good fit for tulip today.

287
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,600
So that is a key, promotional tactic for us.

288
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,500
Additionally, we utilize tools for web content personalization.

289
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,100
It's actually something that we kicked off just in the most recent webinar.

290
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:45,000
So based on certain intent, that we see if they're looking on our website for you know, specific topic.

291
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,100
Then we can tailor.

292
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,600
A website experience where we're promoting engaging or tailored content to them.

293
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,600
So we're just testing that out actually today.

294
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:02,200
So always continuously improving and testing more things.

295
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:13,700
Additionally, because the manufacturing industry tends to navigate to specific watering holes like industry Publications.

296
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,500
We work with industry Publications.

297
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,100
A lot for some of our top.

298
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,300
The funnel webinars because that's where they go to be our Target.

299
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:38,900
Personas, go to access insights to get reporting, you know, ways that they can report on their manufacturing operations, or they would search for or subscribe for various topics.

300
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,300
So we want to be right there as a contender.

301
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,700
And we also have a tailored pop-up experience on our website.

302
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:56,100
So, based on relevant Pages, we also link right to a call to action.

303
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:08,000
And if there's a relevant webinar coming up for, you know, those that are looking at our manufacturing execution system guide, you know, we want that next call to action for them.

304
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:13,000
So we have those on our website on relevant pages.

305
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:21,600
Of course, and we also want to make sure that we're engaging LinkedIn organically.

306
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:35,300
So, we're ensuring that, you know, our speakers are reaching out to their connections, you know, promoting the webinar to their own audiences, so it's really organic there.

307
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:58,600
And then, lastly, and most importantly, I would say, is engaging and enabling our sales So we want to make sure not only when we're promoting webinars that you know the our sales team isn't able to promote those webinars in a timely manner to prospects those that are just trying to get, you know that booked meeting.

308
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:13,000
Maybe you know watching a webinar or attending a webinar that's relevant to their you know email conversation is going to help get that booked meeting or lead to a phone call or even you know lead to that close one.

309
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,700
Done deal.

310
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:26,800
We see a lot of prospects that are in the later stages of the buyers Journey even attending top of funnel webinars because if it's, you know, beginning of the year, they're just trying to evaluate everything.

311
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:43,000
So sometimes that gets, you know, us to, you know, show tulip as a contender and, you know, an RFP evaluation, but we're really trying to test all different angles and engage people.

312
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,800
In the most relevant way.

313
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:57,900
That's those are a lot of great tactics strategies you guys do biology across multiple random rant in a lot of different actors that we're testing.

314
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:04,800
But yeah, it's I think it's important to test different Avenues and learn from them.

315
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,500
That's great.

316
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:12,200
What website platform are you leveraging right now to be able to iterate quickly?

317
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,300
Yeah.

318
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:23,900
So we're using craft Hazard or CMS, and we also have other tools in our Tech stack like six cents.

319
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:40,100
So we're able to identify those accounts that are showing intent for various topics that are showing more intent for tulip, and we can t up some of those relevant webinars to them.

320
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,000
That's amazing.

321
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:42,800
Great.

322
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,300
And then about you mentioned also your connection with the sales team and how you leverage these webinars to enable them.

323
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:56,700
Can you describe like what is that interaction and regular communication like around webinar because?

324
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,300
Yeah, absolutely.

325
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:04,500
So I think it is so important to have that two-way communication between marketing and sales.

326
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:21,600
So that Marv up sales sees that what we're doing is really to help them and to help them progress deals, and get new leads, and that marketing is listening to their recommendation.

327
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:34,700
So for that webinar traceability, you know what we did was I created a survey for the sales team to understand, you know, what do our prospects want to hear from us?

328
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:43,100
What is leading to the most Well engagements is it you know focusing on a use case like traceability and that was one of the recommendations that they shared.

329
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:50,500
So it's not only enabling them but also hearing from them too.

330
00:44:51,100 --> 00:45:03,000
And when I first started here at tulip sales didn't really see webinars as a true demand gen tool and now they're kind of waiting for the next one to come out.

331
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:11,500
You know when's the next email coming out of you know, Adding the sales enablement content for our resources, for our next webinar.

332
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:21,900
So it's, you know, I think there's always a loop of continuous improvement with, you know, marketing and sales alignment.

333
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:31,900
But that's a, it was a good Milestone to hit their, you know, they're excited for that next webinar to be able to promote to their prospects or really excited to see.

334
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,400
You know, the high quality leads that come through that top of funnel event.

335
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,000
That's amazing.

336
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:53,400
Okay, I am going to get really tactical here on communication because you know, I asked these things because most of us have remote teams and so is there like a shared slack Channel where you're able to share out the upcoming webinars and the sales team can ask questions?

337
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,500
Are you updating them on daily weekly?

338
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,500
Like how does that interaction work?

339
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,200
And look like.

340
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,000
Yeah.

341
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:21,200
So I used to update the sales team weekly and their group email, I think what and kind of learn from their feedback that what's really important is to get all of the resources upfront and kind of monthly update but with weekly reminders and check in.

342
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:29,700
So again you know hearing feedback from sales, you know, how do you want to receive the sales enablement content?

343
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,900
When do you want to provide feedback right now?

344
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,500
That email communication is most beneficial Initial.

345
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:44,500
But you know, for some of those weekly check-ins we have that shared slack Channel where they can also reach out to me.

346
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,300
Also, you know, my doors always open to hear feedback and I think that's what's in route.

347
00:46:51,300 --> 00:47:03,400
What's really important to you that myself and my team is always willing to hear feedback that comes from sales and new ideas and recommendations because we do move forward with them.

348
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,700
And we hear what you're saying.

349
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,500
Huge that communication alignment is huge and that's awesome.

350
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:12,500
Yeah.

351
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,600
I mean you're always learning to it's a yeah.

352
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:35,700
I think it's like kind of I don't know if you work folks on the call or feel that too but there's always a gap that you identify and marketing between marketing and sales and how to you know fill that Gap is and understand why you're filling that Gap.

353
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:41,300
Across both functions and teams is what's most important.

354
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:48,600
So it's an uphill battle, but climbing up, awesome.

355
00:47:49,100 --> 00:48:00,700
Well, I think you have shared so many amazing golden nuggets about webinars and how we can attract folks to webinars what they look like across the funnel.

356
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:09,500
Is there anything else that you would add specifically about what And ours that you'd share to us?

357
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,400
Yeah.

358
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:10,700
Yeah.

359
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:30,700
I would say, I shared a couple tidbits, I think if you're able to live experiences compared to you know pre-recorded experiences are what drive that quality engagement throughout the event.

360
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,700
And you know, I think technical difficulties are okay, we're all human.

361
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:45,500
One of our top performing webinar that generated the most Revenue compared to all the other webinars.

362
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,800
There was a total dekhna technical difficulty in the beginning of the webinar.

363
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,500
But people, you know, stuck through and the quality of content was what's most important.

364
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:11,200
So I think those live experiences also show a company or as you know people that are, you know, Wanting to hear more from our Target buyers and engage that discussion.

365
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:35,400
So you mentioned a few things about you know, the beauty marketing Community, really maintain those connections that you gather even, you know, early on in your career because they are kind of career-long connections but also from a webinar perspective hearing from sales and when you can really, you know, have that live experience.

366
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,400
For, for prospects, to be able to engage in real time.

367
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,200
That's awesome.

368
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,400
Is there any?

369
00:49:45,500 --> 00:50:34,900
Final advice that you would give to the B2B marketing community, yeah, those connections are important and I think continuously learning from what you have produced and what you have launched, I think that's, that's another huge tidbit, especially if you're producing a lot like we did in the last year, learning from what worked and what didn't and being able to, you know, have that retro and clear, open conversation with those important stakeholders in a project this is really important for the sustainability of your team but also for you know your marketing program Amazing.

370
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:42,100
Well Meghan, thank you so much for taking the time to impart your wisdom across webinars.

371
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:49,900
I am sure we're going to take re-watch this and take some notes and apply them even to our own.

378
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,500
Let us Die Young or lettuce leaf forever.

379
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:13,300
We do not have power pony, never seen it sitting in a sandpit.

380
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,200
Life is a short trip the musics for the sad man.

381
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:27,300
Can you imagine when the phrase one not gonna faces into the sun prison?

382
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:31,600
Our leaders we get in and turn the music played by them.

383
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,600
The mud, man.

384
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:29,200
So more like what is someone like to hear some of the men in some other be sooner or later?

385
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,800
They all will be gone but don't He stay?

386
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:40,600
It's so hard to get on without it, cause I don't want to perish.

387
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:49,200
Like a fading us cues like diamonds in the Sun and diamonds are forever.
