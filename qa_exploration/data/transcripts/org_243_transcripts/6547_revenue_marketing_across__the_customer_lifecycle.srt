37
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, you know before we jump in, I don't know if you know Madison you noticed, but we had in our intro video a runner, he was a French Runner who is chasing that van really fun video there.

38
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,200
And your Runner is As well.

39
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
In fact, I heard you.

40
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,300
Do you have a half-marathon that you're running?

41
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,500
I do this Sunday will be my first half-marathon.

42
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,000
So I want to know, say I am a full Runner but I have gotten into running and it's been fun.

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,200
So half-marathon this weekend.

44
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,800

45
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,700
So I have no complaints right now.

46
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,800
Excited for some first across off The Bucket List.

47
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,500
Nice.

48
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,400
And how long is a half-marathon 13.1 miles?

49
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,600
Wow, that's still Seems poof like quite a journey.

50
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:39,100
Yes, when I actually put it into perspective of like walking a mile versus running a mile and how many 13 is I regretted it.

51
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,300
But I had already signed up so couldn't turn back at that point.

52
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,300
Good for you, I look forward to hearing how that goes.

It is as the majority voted West Side Story.

67
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,400

68

69
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,200

70
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,400
I see in the chat, you mentioned.

71
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,000
LOL.

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,400
And one for about 5 seconds.

73
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,800
LOL.

74
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,600
And at the 2017 Oscars was announced as the winner.

75
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,400
Hold back.

76
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,800
And it was actually moonlight.

77
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,800
So that's honorable mention will give it as Jordan called out.

78
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:15,800
Nice.

79
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,700
Wow.

80
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,400
Okay.

81
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,800
Well that is some good stuff.

82
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:32,600
I know who to go to next time, you know if I am up there and money's on the line for a movie trivia Madison, I am giving you a call, I will be your phone a friend.

83
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,400
Thank you.

84
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:42,000
All right, well, we'd love to hear more about your journey and your story getting into demand generation.

85
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,800
Loom, can you walk me through you and I had a little dialogue?

86
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,300
Our to this and walk me through.

87
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,500
Like, when you just, you started your journey just getting into B2B marketing.

88
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,400
How do you re?

89
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,000
So I actually started in the fintech world as an account manager.

90
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,900
So really customer success focused and I started at Bloomberg and it was a great experience.

91
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:20,600
It was so amazing to be able to work at a big company that had clients all around the world, not only the us, and what I learned from that, Experience was I love to speaking with the customers was a B2B side of it.

92
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,200
So you know, how are people using your product?

93
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,700
What is it solving for?

94
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,400
How do you think of it?

95
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Internally verse how your customers are using?

96
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,000
It can be so different or it can have unique use cases that you never had thought of.

97
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,100
So I really loved working with customers and I had the opportunity to travel across the u.s.

98
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,900
And meet with them in their offices.

99
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:46,100
So back in the day, when people were traveling like crazy, I was always on the plane, I am racking up.

100
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,600
As Delta SkyMiles to meet with people and just like, how are you using Bloomberg?

101
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
What problems are you facing?

102
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,000
Not only that Bloomberg is solving for but like that's top of mind.

103
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,400
Like what are you worried about?

104
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,200
What's, what are you thinking through?

105
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:05,900
And then trying to figure out how as a complete partner, not just a vendor or a software, can we work to solve those?

106
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:14,700
So that's kind of where I started was more on the account management side and then I realized fintech Financial Services was great, but maybe not.

107
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,300
But kept me up at night and Was riveting to me.

108
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:26,100
So I moved into the more Tech space and I have tried to keep more marketing roles since then and more like marketing B2B SAS still, as kind of like through and through.

109
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:40,600
But started in a very different world compared to where I am today, I would say, wow, okay, so roots are really with the customer in stripping them, as an account manager, and getting the ins and outs there.

110
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,900
So then from Bloomberg, where did you go next and face?

111
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,700
So from Bloomberg, I knew I wanted to get into a more marketing rule but also a little bit more, like the more Tech space I wanted to try out.

112
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:03,200
So I moved still to a SAS B2B company but called Bounce X, which then up branded to wunderkind and I moved into a sales role.

113
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,800
So kind of instead of the post sale what about the pre-sale motion?

114
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,600
And I worked in both like a bdr and account executive fashion.

115
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,700
So very top of the funnel.

116
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,700
How are you understanding the market landscape?

117
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:26,800
And you're proud of your solution and how do you, how do you solve for the problem at hand and actually trying to gain that interest from people and start at the top of the funnel from a sales perspective.

118
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:35,200
So did that for about a year when I got to try to break through the noise of like, hey, this is how Wonder can help your company.

119
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:45,300
Worked with some great e-commerce Brands learned so much about the pre-sale cycle and what that looks like from initial conversations up until signing a contract and formalizing a partnership.

120
00:10:45,600 --> 00:11:00,600
But Realized once again I loved the customer and the prospect conversations but the selling aspect and that AE role wasn't necessarily what I found a lot of passion, so I made a pivot internally at one Dirk into their customer marketing team.

121
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:11,800
So really looking at customer advocacy and how do you do that through referral programs customer advisory boards events partner with our events, team case study is.

122
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,400
So how are you taking that customer voice and bring it to all the different channels which I just Fell in love with marketing from there?

123
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:25,400
So that's kind of the transition from Bloomberg to wunderkind and then from sales to my first quote, unquote, marketing title.

124
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,400
Wow.

125
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,200
And then from one organ.

126
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,500
Did you go to loo right after that?

127
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,400
Yeah, so from one Jerkins, one of my really good friends.

128
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,200
And also co-workers Kate, we work together at wunderkind.

129
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,900
She leads our Event Channel and it's just an absolute rock star.

130
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,800
And she was joining Loom, and she was like, hey, they are starting a strategic marketing.

131
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,900
And you would be a great fit.

132
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,700
You should apply and Kate and I have worked together and I adore her.

133
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,300
So I was like, sure.

134
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,000
I will take the call, we will see what it is.

135
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,200
And I fell in love with looms Mission.

136
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,400
I fell in love with the team from both the marketing and sales team at Loom, I was leadership was great.

137
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,300
That it was kind of great opportunity.

138
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:19,900
To not only further my career with a new industry and a new product, but also start strategic marketing from the ground up at a hyper growth startup, which I just Couldn't pass up the opportunity from every aspect, that's awesome.

139
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,000
And your collective experience working pretty much across the entire Prospect to customer Journey.

140
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,200
Gave you the experience and tools needed to really be successful.

141
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,800
So like coming in Tulum.

142
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,400
What were some of the key problems that you were solving for?

143
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:44,800
And, you know, then we can go into some of the revenue marketing questions that we have, and how you guys are solving for Revenue marketing.

144
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,200
But yeah, what were some of The initial problems.

145
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
And how did you go about tackling them?

146
00:12:49,900 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah, I think when I was looking at joining Loom and when this role was created, it was leading the Strategic marketing team was, which was going to be a net new function within Loom.

147
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:09,800
So it was also building it from the ground up and not necessarily a lot of problems, but a lot of opportunities that Loom was looking into finally like breaking into and growing out.

148
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,800
So, when you're looking at the Strategic marketing World from looms lens, we kind of break it up into new busy.

149
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Account-based marketing.

150
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,600
So how do you do, like, one too few and one-to-one campaigns to generate Pipeline?

151
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:30,800
And then from the customer marketing perspective, how can you have close alignment with your customer success team for renewals upsells expansion opportunities?

152
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,900
How do you create that customer advocacy?

153
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:45,800
So it was a really big, like, Boulder project of what does strategic marketing look like at Loom and getting to work with marketing, folks and colleagues and also sales and customer success to understand.

154
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,700
What does the moon look like today?

155
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:58,900
From a customer's perspective in the Enterprise world and how do we want to up level that and take it to a Next Level compared to necessarily like these are the gaps we're like hey these are the opportunities they're endless.

156
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
Where do we want to start?

157
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
And what's most impactful to start?

158
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,400
Oh, that's so good and interesting.

159
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,400
So then I have a question just going into your initial like even targeting.

160
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:17,900
You know, you said that you guys focused more on like an ABM type of strategy versus a one Many strategies or let us ?

161
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,800
Do you do both?

162
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,600
Like, is it more so a spear fishing game versus a Netflix?

163
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,400
So I think it depends on the channel of marketing you're looking at.

164
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:45,900
So when I was joining, I joined in the Strategic marketing role I and now head up, our demand generation team, so it kind of oversees both you have your one too many tactics but you also have your one, too, few in your one-to-one and it kind of depends on what is your goal outcome.

165
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:57,200
Um, so Loom is a product LED Growth Company, which means anyone who's listening right now, can go on lulu.com, sign up for free, try out the product, learn to use it, and then we also have an Enterprise offering.

166
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:05,900
So, if your org is looking at bringing on loom as a partner for asynchronous work in collaboration, that's the kind of side that the demand gen team focuses on.

167
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:15,900
So we do one too many campaigns like content, launches and webinars and conferences to get the loom name and brand out there and educate people on the shift to a sink.

168
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:31,600
Is work, but we also do some really high level one too few and 121 channels like executive dinners or an account-based marketing like campaign from a gifting perspective, so we get I think demand generation and my current role.

169
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,700
I love it because it's a really good balance of both.

170
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,800
Just depending on like who the audience is at hand.

171
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,500
Mmm, that's good.

172
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:46,600
And you know, one of the things I think is constantly keeping that pulse on the data that you're getting, you know, Across.

173
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,500
What are some of the key metrics that you're constantly?

174
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,400
Just keeping top of mine.

175
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,500
And you know, how are you measuring that and having those conversations with sales and customer success?

176
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:11,400
Yeah, I think we're looking at like the who were targeting, there's a couple of things but like, keeping the customers, keeping the customer Centric, which of course, is the topic of this.

177
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,300
But like who, what is the end goal of like, their current knowledge?

178
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:26,500
So we're in a great spot where we have a free and a business product, and we still want to continue to get people just using loom and on the mission of transforming, the way people work.

179
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:36,600
So when you're looking at that group of people, you really want to make sure you're nurturing them from like a thought, leadership, activation and usage, adoption perspective.

180
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:45,900
But then, when you look at what you'd consider, like your ideal customer profile for the Enterprise skew, which is where our demand generation is really focused on driving that.

181
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,600
Ripa sales from our sales lad and our prize offering perspective, you're looking at who is the right fit for us?

182
00:16:52,700 --> 00:17:03,600
Do are these topics like distributed work, hybrid work, top of mind for them and like making sure that your value prop is aligning with their business needs.

183
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,200
And that's kind of like what you're keeping a pulse.

184
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:15,900
I was like who's talking about async work, who's talking about looking on collaborating through different time zones and like that's the data you want to make sure you're staying on.

185
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,700
Above because it makes you a partner compared to just a line item, vendor or solution.

186
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,900
That's great.

187
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:33,100
There's actually a question that just popped in and I actually think it aligns very well to what her talking about here.

188
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:41,300
So I am going to pull it on stage, oops, sorry, Katie.

189
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,200
Katie is my producer.

190
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,800
They're all right.

191
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:53,300
So how do you prioritize your budget and resources between campaigns for your free product versus your Enterprise offering?

192
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,000
Great question.

193
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:05,600
Yeah and I will say if anyone has a full correct answer to this like let me know because this is how we're approaching it but there are so many different ways from Marketing perspective.

194
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:15,200
I am really fortunate to have great marketing Partners within looms marketing, departments such as like products marketing, growth marketing, our brand Team and then our comms team.

195
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:22,400
So, when you're looking across the different marketing channels, we all have different like key Focus areas while we're all leading up to the same goal.

196
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,200
So something like our product marketing team.

197
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:33,700
There's a few people on that team who are really focused on like creating products for a marketing products, like the free offering and our growth marketing.

198
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,500
Team is really focused on just sign up.

199
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,800
So across our free business, they're really focused on that, like, self-serve side.

200
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,400
When we're looking at like demand gen, so my team specifically, our number one, focus is going to be that Enterprise offering.

201
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:56,100
So majority of our budget and our time and our resources will go for our Enterprise offering with in helping our counterparts, that growth marketing who's focused on signups.

202
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,900
Because I always feel like you hear this flywheel of, like, you start.

203
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
Someone as a sign up.

204
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,200
They begin to use Loom.

205
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,500
They might switch companies.

206
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:03,800
Then they.

207
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,500
Common Enterprise client possibly, then you can in front of them.

208
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
So you're having that whole life cycle.

209
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:22,500
So our team focuses on our budgets and resources for the Enterprise offering and then different marketing functions and teams within Loom, like our product and growth team will focus more on like a sign ups for our freedom business.

210
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,100
So that's kind of how we break it up based off of teams and priorities.

211
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,200
Gotcha.

212
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:41,000
And, and okay, so here's another question because you mentioned a growth team and you guys are working on, demand, generation mainly, Jean Enterprises you mentioned, but I see sometimes growth getting intermixed with demand gen.

213
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:55,600
Yeah, how do you define, you know, even just from Madison's perspective, like, how are you defining the differentiation between demand generation and growth and how they work with the right teams to?

214
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,000
Yeah.

215
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,800
Comes so our head of growth marketing, Nick Lafferty is a phenomenal human being that.

216
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,200
I am so blessed to work with as well.

217
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,400
And when Looking at kind of like his world in my world.

218
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,900
Nick works with our product and growth team as well.

219
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,700
So they're focused on signups.

220
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:21,200
So how do we get more free and work signups and then my world is then when they're ready to graduate to our Enterprise offering, how do we engage those people?

221
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:29,600
So I couldn't necessarily do my job without their team focusing on signups and where you have that intersect is something like ads.

222
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:55,100
So if you're trying to run some ads on LinkedIn, that growth team would typically maybe take a lead on but there's a really specific Target list that we want to get in front of from an Enterprise offering how can Nick and I work together to launch at ad campaign both for a wider audience but also for a specific account list to get in front of them or when it's looking at launching new ads, and he really wants to integrate the customer voice.

223
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,000
How does he work with customer marketing?

224
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,700
Which is under my team to like, get those customer voices in those case studies to launch from an SEO or an ad perspective.

225
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,100
The way we Define it as they're really focus on those like free and business offerings.

226
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,100
And we're focused on graduating those to an Enterprise offering.

227
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,900
But there's so many cross-sectional areas in campaigns.

228
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,500
We both get to work on together which I think just makes the entire Loom message and voice.

229
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,100
One holistic company, compared to siloed, teams working for different goals.

230
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,300
That's good.

231
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,800
Wow.

232
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Okay, so going back to holistic.

233
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,600
This is where I think the term Revenue.

234
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Getting comes into play.

235
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,500
And how do you define revenue marketing?

236
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,800
They're seeing different things out there.

237
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:49,500
I have to, I have always seen different definitions and I think it's really interesting the way I have historically, like viewed.

238
00:21:49,500 --> 00:22:03,700
It is like, how are you using marketing tactics or campaigns events or programs to drive pipeline opportunity for whether that's however your business is set up?

239
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:10,500
How are you driving like marketing campaigns and efforts to drive pipeline or realized Revenue as a company?

240
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,000
And I think that looks different depending on every company structure.

241
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:23,500
But from looms perspective, we're looking at the revenue from demand General Revenue marketing, like really close alignment with your marketing and sales team to generate that.

242
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:32,200
So, I think Revenue marketing to me has a closer alignment with sales, then some other types of marketing at different companies.

243
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,200
Gotcha and describe that relationship with sales.

244
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,000
I know this is also another big topic that often, but how is it for you?

245
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,700
What's your philosophy on that partnership?

246
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,600
And you know what does that interaction look like for you on a daily on a weekly monthly basis?

247
00:22:50,300 --> 00:23:02,100
Yeah, I historically and even now say I think the thing I love about demand generation, strategic marketing is you get to work, so cross-functional across different companies.

248
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,100
I think I have always gravitated towards a customer marketing, strategic, marketing, or demand generation Rule.

249
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:17,900
And I think, when you're looking at the partnership between sales and marketing, the biggest thing for me is making sure that you have one unified goal across both teams.

250
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,500
So, like, how can you create a goal?

251
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:32,400
If it's pipeline, if it's close one Revenue, if it's signups that both teams are incentivized to work together or there's at least a flow of, if marketing hits their goals, it clearly translates.

252
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,900
Stu, how sales can then achieve their goals and I think that has been huge for me.

253
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:46,800
And at Loom, one of the reasons I came to loom, is the sales leaders and the sales team I was working with were just phenomenal, Advocates of marketing, and vice versa.

254
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:56,500
So I work with our sales team, they're probably some of my biggest stakeholders is making sure that we're helping them hit their closed, one Target.

255
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:07,900
And when we're launching campaigns from a one-to-many went too few one-to-one, we have their support, and we're Speaking, that's a message of we're going after the same targets, we're having a unified message.

256
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:15,700
My success is directly linked to your success and like, making sure that is like, in lockstep has been great.

257
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:21,600
But I think I talked to sometimes our sales and say yes to more than my actual like marketing counterparts at times.

258
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Wow.

259
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,900
So that the frequency is quite often.

260
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,800
And is it like a daily interaction on check-in?

261
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,200
You know each other's metrics and holding each other accountable?

262
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,600
We do.

263
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,200
So at Loom we have like a revenue leadership.

264
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,500
So from the go-to-market side of our business, we do weekly check-ins from a sales leadership and Market leadership.

265
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,800
I try to also meet with the leaders one-on-one every week, every other week, just to make sure we're in alignment.

266
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:56,200
And then on top of that, I think, like, throughout the day, there's plenty of things or ideas or hey, can you jump in this team meeting to explain this new campaign that's going live.

267
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,300
Our hey, we're thinking about investing into this conference or this ABM campaign.

268
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,300
Do you have some time to chat?

269
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,200
Through it.

270
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,100
So we're all in the same shared slack channel.

271
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,900
So we see what each other are posting.

272
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:16,000
We have sync time, check-ins, and then selfish plug is like, I use Luma lot to be like, hey this, these are my thoughts of the team's planner.

273
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,800
Hey, this is a campaign, I am going to run.

274
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,100
Can I get your eyes on and I send it over, and they send thoughts back?

275
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:31,200
So I would be shocked if there's a day I go without talking to anyone from sales, but we do have formal check-ins as much as just informal check-ins as well.

276
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,300
That's great.

277
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,000
And I love how you all are using your product asynchronously we use Loom.

278
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,300
Similarly, so we're making it.

279
00:25:40,600 --> 00:26:00,200
Yeah, it just helps when you, I think the thing with sales and marketing is you're just running a million miles a minute like very other teams and departments and personas as well, but, you know if someone's on a live call and that's the only time I am between a call, it's just hard to always, like, a line schedules with, like, calendar Tetris so looms.

280
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,100
When a great way to be like, hey, here's a campaign idea.

281
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,700
Let me, We have a second or like the salesman cake, here are some feedback of what's worked in our sales process.

282
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,200
Like feel free to take a look when you have some time, and then we can mold that into each other's work as well.

283
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,500
That's great.

284
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:24,700
So, as far as the key stakeholders across the company that you're in touch with regularly, are you in touch with the head of sales, the head of growth marketing, the head of customer success.

285
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,800
Like are those the key folks that you're working with Anna?

286
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,200
Yeah.

287
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,400
Even a weekly basis.

288
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,200
I would break it up kind of into like the Different departments.

289
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:50,200
So from the marketing perspective, Laura hard our VP of marketing very closely with her and the other marketing leaders which span across a growth marketing, our brand, our products, marketing, and our columns because we want to make sure that the message we're saying is Unified across all of our marketing channels.

290
00:26:50,200 --> 00:27:03,600
So meeting with them frequently weekly as well, and then from a sales perspective, looking at our head of customer success, our head of sales, but also the managers for our AES, the managers for our Those Dev teams as well.

291
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,600
And then, I think another benefit that I get to work closely with is our products team.

292
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,500
So when you're looking at something like your site and web forms, how can you experiment with our product?

293
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,700
How do we build Enterprise features and offering?

294
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,100
So then you also have the product team that I work closely with.

295
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,600
And then very fortunate that we have great exec team here at Loom.

296
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
So getting to work with them.

297
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,400
I like what's resonating with people different areas we want to test into marketing how they view.

298
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,800
Our Relations.

299
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,600
And then also using them to get it from the customer.

300
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:44,900
So how can we create more executive relationships and like, full Partnerships from a thought, leadership, a Solutions, a networking opportunities as well?

301
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,500
So looking at like a full partnership with people and bringing our execs into that as well, so good.

302
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,200
Okay, cool.

303
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,500
That's really helpful.

304
00:27:52,800 --> 00:28:25,700
If anyone has questions, feel free to drop them in QA Madison, I would love to move into the conversation that you and I had Before this time when we were talking about just the inundation of crowded in boxes and how, you know, we're in a funky time right now, with the recession with tech layoffs, taking place, you know, you see a lot of folks, missing forecasts especially this quarter, yet Revenue numbers are still higher than last year.

305
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:41,900
So it's kind of like this like a really funky time and so you know from a B2B marketing standpoint Fires and Prospects are inundated with emails, in particular, seems to be like that's like one of the go twos.

306
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,800
But I mean, I hundreds of emails a day and it's like, ah, you know, noise there.

307
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,400
You're now LinkedIn, massive Channel.

308
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,200
Like there're other channels, Facebook Tip, Top stuff.

309
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,700
You know what's working for you?

310
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,500
What, what, what's like some tea?

311
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:07,400
I don't know if you figured out your Bullet to get in front of, get through the noise, what's working?

312
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,300
What's not working?

313
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:17,900
You know, I think that's, I mean, I definitely feel it from both sides from like the consumer of getting lots of emails, then from the marketer trying to break through the noise.

314
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:32,500
And I think the thing we try to keep in mind, is every person consumes information differently, and I think you go back like elementary school and then you get learn to you get taught to learn different ways like Hands-On verse reading.

315
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,800
Denver's video.

316
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,100
And I think what we try to keep in mind is like, how can we continue to diversify our channels or hit multiple channels?

317
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:49,200
So you know, some people might still prefer email, but then we have to do that channel incredibly well because it is so crowded.

318
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,600
And then there might be another person whose like, hey you know what, something that's kind of hard to do.

319
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,100
Because we're distributed now, but like Direct Mail.

320
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,600
I am a huge fan of gifting and direct mail.

321
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,100
I think you break through the noise that way.

322
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:06,900
And I know personally, like, I check our Box every day I do, I am not expecting anything, but I love a letter, I love a package.

323
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,700
Like I will always look that way.

324
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,600
So how do you take what's under your marketing or sales per view?

325
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,900
And like, make sure you're hitting people through different channels at a respectable Cadence.

326
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,900
So how can you partner in email touch point?

327
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,900
And then maybe three to five days later.

328
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,700
Try a LinkedIn touch point and then see who's engaging from there.

329
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,500
Okay, both of those were myths.

330
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,300
Okay, let us try to introduce a direct mail piece or hey, email the Age, but they didn't click through?

331
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,600
How can we take email a step further?

332
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:46,600
You know, maybe we add a layer of personalization with like a specific landing page or an image, like really just evaluating everything on an ongoing basis.

333
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:54,300
So, you're partnering LinkedIn with in-person events with direct mail with gifting and then still doing email.

334
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:02,500
So I think for us it's just like how many channels can we use and continue to like keep a pulse on the learning.

335
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,400
So that if something is working, we can catch it.

336
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,300
If something's not working, we can pivot.

337
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,600
I think that's the name of the game is, like pivoting quickly, while still realizing like some things will work.

338
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,400
Let us test them.

339
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,700
Some things will test, and they won't work, and that's okay.

340
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,300
You learned.

341
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,500
Mmm, that's good.

342
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:24,400
And you mentioned the pulse not going back to your customer experience passion.

343
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,500
You know, you got to be tight with your customer.

344
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,800
You gotta know.

345
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,300
So how do you all do that?

346
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,100
Like, how do you keep that pulse?

347
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,500
Because it could get very, you know, how it is.

348
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,700
There's so many channels so many things to manage in marketing.

349
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,400
How do you keep your pulse?

350
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,500
Really close with your customer?

351
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,400
Yeah, I think that's whereas much as you can.

352
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:53,400
You create a holistic relationship with a customer compared to a transactional relationship.

353
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,900
Now, not everyone wants that at Time Square.

354
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,800
Like, hey, I need a solution and that's fine in.

355
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,500
Those can still be your strongest Advocates but are there ways?

356
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,900
As you can row, a relationship with the customer.

357
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,200
Are they hiring for their team?

358
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,300
Can you share that job posting with someone?

359
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:16,100
You might think it's good fit, your personal Network are they having issues with like figuring out how to onboard in a remote World?

360
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:28,500
Okay, can we share how we do that at Loom and how we have approached it is they looking to you know maybe they want to get into content more, do we have a case study, we could feature them in or do we have a blog post?

361
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,600
We could have them post and I think we have a phenomenal customer success team.

362
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:47,100
Here that is able to build those personal relationships and then when you take it, that next level is like, okay, how do we up level that to be a more thoughtful, istic partner than just that transactional like, hey here's our service.

363
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,500
You use our service, I will talk to you at renewals, which RCS?

364
00:32:50,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Tune does not do their phenomenal but sometimes you have to go that white glove service, a little bit above and beyond compared to other times, which takes more work, takes a little bit more creativity, but your point in turn.

365
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:08,500
Having your pulse on your customers and getting to use their voices tenfold every single time.

366
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,500
Mmm.

367
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:09,800
Okay.

368
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
That's interesting.

369
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,900
So, do you find yourself, aligning prioritizing, even a lot of strategy towards that custom Mark marketing angle.

370
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:28,400
Like, like when you have the prioritize across that Journey, where do you see is like really strategically important to focus on?

371
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,400
I think it depends on your company goals, as well.

372
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,800
Like We're how mature are you from a sales outside of the business, and I am.

373
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:37,800
Sorry.

374
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:47,800
There are some construction going on, if anyone can hear that but well at my previous role at wunderkind where I was specifically full-time in customer marketing.

375
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That was we were more mature company in terms of like our customer base.

376
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,100
We had so many Brands we had to show them love to.

377
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,200
So our primary focus was we had one clear buyer.

378
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,500
So how do we work with that fire to be like they're complete partner?

379
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:12,100
Through all things that they might worry about when you're looking at Loom, and we're still growing, our sales inside the business and our Enterprise offering you have to balance it with.

380
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:18,500
How do you get new customers versus how do you continue to love and nurture your existing customers?

381
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,100
But we will throw is like the same love.

382
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,600
You'd give to your existing customers.

383
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,800
You have to apply to your prospects because they could be that customer.

384
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:34,000
And the moment you start interacting with them from that first touch point with loom, that's going to set the stage for the Our customer lifecycle.

385
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,699
So how do you make sure from that first patch Point?

386
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:50,699
You're still giving them that white glove service or that flower that solution, that then will nurture them and continue to grow, through the sales cycle, through closing through becoming a customer and then the lifetime of renewals and expansions and partnership opportunities.

387
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,900
That's key it.

388
00:34:52,900 --> 00:35:04,000
And would you say like that's something I know you're passionate about is being able to align that thread line experience across Ross, all those touch points.

389
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,300
I mean, how challenging is that, though?

390
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
You know what I am saying?

391
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,300
Like, why?

392
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,600
I mean, you're looking at bandwidth to like in a world that's distributed at you can't get in person anymore.

393
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,800
You can always travel.

394
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,700
So I think it's like an ongoing question of, like, what is the right way to do it?

395
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,500
What's the most effective way to do it?

396
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:30,000
I think from My Lens it's just like being very thoughtful in your brand and how you want that to come across?

397
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,600
And that's where we work really closely with like Brand Team, visually our content team from the content we're putting out.

398
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,500
And like, how do you from the beginning?

399
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:50,200
Make sure that like, your brand voice is consistent through a webinar or piece of content or a one-pager follow-up, and that you become more of just, instead of just like a name, you're like, oh Loom.

400
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,900
I understand like they're, they have that logo.

401
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,100
They have like this, you at work messaging.

402
00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:00,700
They have those reduced meetings, the meetings canceled candle, like how do you become more of a moment?

403
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:15,000
No movement, then just Unnecessary, like, oh, I think I heard of loom weights, and that, then we will have that credibility, that will bring you throughout the entire life cycle, whether it's high level or 121 touch points.

404
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
That's great.

405
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:31,900
I am going to ask a more tactical question when it comes to Journey mapping and you know, just beginning to ideate shape and strategically identify the areas that you want to focus on.

406
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,800
Is there like a team?

407
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,700
Like do you guys work as a team to build out journey maps of your existing prospects?

408
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,900
And is that how you get alignment?

409
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:51,600
So that everybody is pretty streamlined or what's an Activity or thing that you guys do to be able to map that out.

410
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:05,200
I think when it comes to our Enterprise offering and working closely with our sales teams like our sales Dev leader and r8u leaders and just the head of sales as we do talk to you through.

411
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,700
Like okay, who are we targeting?

412
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,300
What's that account?

413
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,400
What does that Persona?

414
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,400
What is that customer profile, that's a right fit and then what is the message?

415
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Messaging that lands with them and then who's going to own that?

416
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,000
So what is that formal process of like, hey marketing will own these efforts.

417
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,400
This is where we will need support from the sales Dev team sales devil on these efforts.

418
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,100
Okay, we have alignment there now, what's the handoff process look?

419
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,200
Like, how involved is marketing from an open Ops perspective?

420
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,100
What's that Cadence?

421
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,600
Like, it's really mapping out.

422
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,400
How do we need this journey to look, internally from what we think and then who's going to own what?

423
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,000
And how does that all speak together?

424
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,800
And then when you're looking from a Smurf success perspective.

425
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,900
It's kind of similar.

426
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,700
It's okay.

427
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,900
What are the biggest?

428
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,500
What are the biggest issues?

429
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,700
Our customers are facing.

430
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,000
Do we not have, you know, executive relationships that are strong enough?

431
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,900
Do we have questions regarding use, cases and adoption?

432
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,300
Okay.

433
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:09,500
So what does that Journey look like with our head of onboarding Brittany and then our head of Cs like, what does that Journey look like from signing a contract to Renewal?

434
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,200
And what points do we need?

435
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,000
Touch points?

436
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,400
And that, how did marketing support that how will onboarding on that?

437
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,200
How will see s on that?

438
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:25,600
So it's really just like when you're looking at the life cycle, understanding who's going to own what and with what channels and then keeping those touch points on.

439
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,200
So be like, hey guys, this is where we're at with this.

440
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,700
Where are you at with that and keeping those lines of communication open?

441
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,500
That's really good.

442
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,300
Thank you for breaking that down.

443
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,800
I think that's helpful to hear.

444
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,700
I often think time like everyone does it a little bit differently, you know, hearing how you all aligned to it.

445
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,800
Far as creating objectives and like accountability.

446
00:38:49,800 --> 00:39:04,500
That way, is it also done in a similar fashion where you're aligning with each team head and determining where the priorities are for the business need and then coming up with objectives together.

447
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,500
Yeah, I would say it's a little bit of both.

448
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,100
So it's looking if you're looking at the revenue side of it.

449
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
So the go-to-market side, it's like, you know what?

450
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:18,900
Our goals for closed, one Revenue This quarter and, you know, how do we want to Pace towards a company?

451
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,700
Okay, so this is how much we need to close.

452
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,500
How much pipeline do you need to generate?

453
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,400
Because an ideal world, every deal you open closes to pipeline, but we obviously know things.

454
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:27,800
Come up.

455
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,900
Timing isn't perfect.

456
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,700
So you know what is our goal for closed?

457
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:38,200
One Revenue as a company, then how do we need pipeline generated and what does that pipeline ownership look like?

458
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:44,500
So, you know, looking at your typical like pipeline generating functions like a sales development team or a marketing team.

459
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,200
And this case Duration breaking those out into ownerships.

460
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,600
So then what we do is when we have our pipeline Target or our opportunity Target, you know, I bring that back to my team, and we say, OK, this is our goals.

461
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,000
How do we think we can hit this?

462
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,500
What campaigned, what events, what content can we create?

463
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:08,100
Launch and run that will help us get to those goals and then you bring that back to your cross-functional partners and say this is our cue for plan.

464
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,400
This is the calendar we're proposing.

465
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,300
Does this work in alignment with your guys's goals as well?

466
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,200
You know, can we get the brand support?

467
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,400
We For this the product marketing support the cam support.

468
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:28,100
And, you know if sales comes back with a very different calendar, okay, now, we know ahead of time, we have to both reset and like, figure out what that makes up was, but really just coming together.

469
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,200
Collectively then going to the experts in each area and saying, how do we hit this?

470
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:37,700
Then coming back together and be like, is everyone aligned on this calendar, to start great.

471
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,500
Let us run with it.

472
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,600
And then you those weekly check-ins really helped be like, hey, we're under pacing.

473
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
We're over pacing.

474
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:53,500
We need to Pivot But as much as is much pre understanding of like, this is what our goal is as an entire sales on motion.

475
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,600
Here's a the demand gen team thinks we can do in terms of achieving it.

476
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,900
And how does that align with it?

477
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:05,400
You guys are thinking or are there any red flags that either team needs to call out or get support on for this to work?

478
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,100
So that's a whole like pre-planning process and Alignment before you go into execution.

479
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,300
Exactly.

480
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:21,700
Because I think the worst thing you can do is silo that off to, okay, I have this pipeline goal.

481
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:37,400
I think this is what we will hit it, and I am just going to run in my race and do what I am doing without other input because, you know, you could be missing something huge, the alignment could be a little bit off, or if you don't have that cross functional support or understanding.

482
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:43,000
Like, you could be running all of these efforts which are great but then the follow-up falls through.

483
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:59,000
So I really make sure before Or anything is executed, you guys that you have buy-in and you have an understanding of the impact in why I think translates into a program success in smooth execution before you're even like Off to the Races.

484
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,600
That's good.

485
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,100
Wow.

486
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,500
Okay.

487
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,200
Rich.

488
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Insights that.

489
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:15,300
If it is anybody has any questions feel free to drop them otherwise we can move into you know, we here.

490
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:36,400
We're trying to create an environment where we can encourage one another as well, because B2B marketing is tough right now, you know, I mean, you called out like the market trends the cluttered in boxes, like now more than ever to you have so many other obstacles and new barriers of prejudice, but we used to have.

491
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,600
So, I mean, it's yeah, it's a tough world.

492
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,300
It is.

493
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,400
So with that Madison, do you have any words of encouragement?

494
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,900
It or advice to us.

495
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,400
It could be a tactical point of encouragement or general.

496
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,300
Feel free to share that.

497
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:08,300
Yeah, I think my professor and one of my mentors once said, it's when you're looking at like an obstacle or climbing a mountain, you know, you take it one step at a time and you can't do it alone.

498
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:18,900
And I have been incredibly fortunate to have so many great mentors and even just co-workers and friends who have I am willing to share insights and advice and thoughts exactly.

499
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,300
Like we're doing right now.

500
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:30,600
But like thing, my biggest piece of advice is just give that back if someone asks a question, if someone raises their hand, if someone wants to network, take that coffee chat.

501
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:41,900
Promote thought leadership, as much as like, each company has their own goal will make it a better community and will become smarter more efficient marketers if we're all willing to like work together.

502
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:48,900
So I think for myself it's like you take it step by step, so you Each challenge by each Challenge and take it for face value.

503
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,400
Do the best.

504
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,900
You can learn how to Pivot quickly but also be grateful for what you have learned in those moments.

505
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,900
And then you can't do it alone.

506
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:03,300
So, you know, reach out a helping hand because there will be a time when you will need help too.

507
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:14,800
So, just continue to give back and network and be willing to promote thought leadership, whether you think it's thought leadership or not, I guarantee you someone will find it useful or helpful.

508
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:23,000
So I am always wanted to be like a try to give it back as much as you can, because it means that much, and then they do it tenfold as well hoof.

509
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,900
Powerful, those are powerful words.
