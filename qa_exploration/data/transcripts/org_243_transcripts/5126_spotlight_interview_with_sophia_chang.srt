4
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:53,700
So I am looking forward to kicking up the story and here and unpacking a little bit more about her journey, but in the meantime, just Some housekeeping notes.

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:07,800
And if you need some closed captioning, there is a volume bar, right underneath this stage that you can adjust the volume and hit the CC on.

7
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,200
So with that, we want to start with a poll.

8
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:21,000
So those of you who know Sofia she is an entrepreneur and illustrator a designer, a creative leader.

9
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,300
She's an influencer.

10
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,000
ER, in our day and age today, and she's worked with probably every shoe brand possible.

11
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,800
So, let us take a quick vote of all of these Brands.

12
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,000
Which one did she not work on?

13
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,200
Okay.

14
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,000
So we're seeing Nike and Reebok.

15
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,500
All right.

16
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,200
Well, let us bring Sophia on.

17
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,500
Come on in.

18
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,600
Join me, Sophia.

19
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Hey, hey Gina.

20
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,400
How you do?

21
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
I am doing great.

22
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,700
How are you?

23
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,500
I am good to see you.

24
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
I just noticed a little welcome logo behind you.

25
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,700
I love it.

26
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,600
Nice.

27
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
We have turned it into art as well.

28
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,100
So, so of those logos, which one did you not work with?

29
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:20,300
These are some pretty close answers or know people did their own research, but the fog New balance is the one brand that I actually haven't had a chance to be able to work with gotcha.

30
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:27,800
Okay, but it all, those are some pretty phenomenal brands that you have had the chance to work on and Sophia.

31
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,000
I am so excited to be able to have this moment.

32
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:44,500
Even honored to be able to have this moment to do a little Spotlight on you and hear your amazing journey of how you got to where you are and even doing the work supporting these brands.

33
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,900
And it's quite a fantastic Journey.

34
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,600
But let us go all the way back.

35
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,700
If you could take us back to even your roots.

36
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,200
Like where did you grow up?

37
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,700
And what were those roots like?

38
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,500
Because I know it's all about those roots that shape who you are today.

39
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,400
Oh, yeah.

40
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,100
Absolutely.

41
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,300
I definitely have a lot of credit to give to my groups.

42
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,500
I have been very fortunate and grateful.

43
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:25,100
I had a chance to be able to grow up in New York City, born and raised in Queens, and that definitely played an Into just my identity, you know, being able to be immersed in this environment of a lot of stimulation from noises defense.

44
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,100
I literally would listen to the sound that fall asleep to the sound of car alarms going off.

45
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:51,100
I can literally can remember the exact order of the sound and, but, yeah, I mean, I am just being around so much stimulation, and I am pretty sure I had a TV or something, but I haven't been officially diagnosed but that Definitely contributes to just this Lively energy I have and just always looked for an outlet.

46
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:59,700
So, in terms of present day, you know, I would say I am an illustrator and designer by trade, but I am also very much, a Storyteller work on a number of different types of mediums.

47
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:14,400
Everything from t-shirts to print, magazines to branding and design to selling prints of my work to get having a chance to be able to collaborate with a lot of Brands and also create a parallel.

48
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,100
I don't think sneakers to websites.

49
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:27,800
So really, I am just a Creator, a Storyteller, and loved working on different types of canvases, surfaces platforms, be able to tell stories, that's amazing.

50
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,400
So take us back even further to your upbringings.

51
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:41,800
Yeah, so I mentioned, I am originally from New York, born and raised in Queens and some of my really early influences were, you know, just growing up in the 90s.

52
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,000
You got hip hop, music was really Sneakers was really inspired by the street art.

53
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,600
That was around me.

54
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
We can go to the next Slide.

55
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,500
By the way, the street art that was around me.

56
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,300
Obviously, taking the subway, the overground subway.

57
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,500
You just see all these graffiti around you all the time and just, it was just so much stimulation.

58
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,000
So that's definitely played a lot into.

59
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,100
Just my early years, early influences.

60
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,600
We can go over to the next slide where you can literally see.

61
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,300
I am not kidding when I say and listen to a lot of (hip-hop) and rap music.

62
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,300
New Jersey, by the way, is actually a jersey dress.

63
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,100
You can't tell him that and that photo, that's a little Polo sport bag to bring you know, throw about.

64
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,400
I am doing a lot of it.

65
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Like I was able, you know, I used to work part-time jobs on the side just to be able to get sneakers.

66
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,400
So that's a pair of patent Air.

67
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:46,200
Jordan are Jordan One's classic, you know, just with graffiti and all of that was really inspired to just create my own little tag that I would go to the Post Office, get the sticker draw, a little The situation, I would even die cut it.

68
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,300
That's how it has that shape.

69
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,200
And then I was just like, stick it all around school and stuff like that.

70
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,900
So he's just take, take us back.

71
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,300
Give us a little bit of notes on SC.

72
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,900
Like, how did you come up with?

73
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,600
Is that your name or?

74
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,200
Yeah, so my name is Sophia Chang and my initials RS.

75
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,800
See, so growing up, you know, especially in the graffiti World street art World.

76
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Everyone kind of went by this Alias name, and so I just went by this one just because it was just phonetically sounded like my initials.

77
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,500
And that's what I ended up landing on and then you know, AOL Instant Messenger people made screen names.

78
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,500
I would just do a CES, why?

79
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,100
And I am backwards.

80
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,900
So Ma I so and then you know, I went to college at the buyer website domain.

81
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,000
Do you know what to do?

82
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,700
So just use my screen name.

83
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,900
Same thing with started Instagram.

84
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,700
Everyone's draining, Instagram couldn't think of anything else?

85
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,900
Oh just went with that.

86
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,400
But yeah, that's the story behind.

87
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,600
He ask.

88
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,300
Oh, that is so cool.

89
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,700
I didn't even know that and I know there's like a sc.

90
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,000
And am I right?

91
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,900
And yes, what am I just I am backwards.

92
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,800
Wow, of course.

93
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,400
It's super creative.

94
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,200
I love that.

95
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,800
And these pictures are awesome.

96
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,000
You had cornrows.

97
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:17,300
Did you play sports to um, not really, but Sports culture, you know, which is so deeply intertwined with Arts and Music anyways, right?

98
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:26,600
General, like sense of style, you know, I was obviously really into Street where before they were, it was coined a name, you know, obviously into a lot of them.

99
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:35,500
More 90s inspired types of clothes from wearing a lot of Jordans to, you know, Marc Ecko baby fat.

100
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,600
A lot of these breaths.

101
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,700
Our backgrounds.

102
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,400
Yeah, and then my best friend growing up the girl who's in the photo next to me her older.

103
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,100
Sister would braid hair.

104
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:54,300
So literally after school and Elementary, I would just go over to her house, and we'd watch music videos and her sister would just bring my hair for fun.

105
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,800
So I am just walking around with these cornrows all the time.

106
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:05,300
I, I think there were there was a certain point where I had my whole head done too, but it was just, I mean growing up in Queens.

107
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,600
It's so extremely diverse as well.

108
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:26,800
Like we have we're all like how I explain to people as in elementary school, everyone packs their lunch, kind of And literally have like the Indian kids meeting Indians when you're like to know what is that, you know, people are looking at the food that I am eating, you know, an American, you know, the white kids have their own thing, you know, Spanish kids have this stuff.

109
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,200
So we're all kind of all tasting, each other's home, cooked meals, and you go to your friend's house after school.

110
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,700
And it's just, it's very different.

111
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,700
You know, I grew up in a Christian household where we have to pray before we eat you, go to someone else's house.

112
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,100
It's a whole nother situation.

113
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,400
So it was I was very fortunate to be able to grow up in an environment.

114
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,700
Moment where you know, so deeply inversed amongst so many different types of cultures.

115
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,200
Yeah.

116
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,600
Wow, and would you say a lot of those cultures all of that?

117
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:05,000
Now that it is sparking your creativity in your early years and all of that sort of has influenced the work that you even do today.

118
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,900
Yeah.

119
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,800
Absolutely.

120
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,200
Yeah.

121
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,200
It was just like extreme overstimulation.

122
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,900
I guess that's another way to put it.

123
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,300
Wow, like sight sounds cultures people, you know languages holler languages.

124
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,700
Yeah, you take the 7 train.

125
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,800
That's like one of the primary trains that brings you to Queens every person that says sitting next to each other, the speaking a different language.

126
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,800
So it's just like it's a lot all at once all the time.

127
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,900
Wow, that's exciting.

128
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900
So all of this, these are your roots.

129
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,200
And then what like what happened, how?

130
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,200
Did you get into doing what you do?

131
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,400
What you do today?

132
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,100
Which are.

133
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:54,000
So obviously being just someone who had so much energy always had a lot of interest in the creative arts, you know, shared a little bit about my roots.

134
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,500
So I was really fortunate to be able to go to college and attend Parsons School of Design.

135
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,700
You can do the math and, you know, really valued my four years in undergrad.

136
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:10,800
I majored in illustration and, you know, really learn about the professional side of things.

137
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,200
This a lot of time.

138
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
People would think, oh, drawing is just a hobby.

139
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,500
But how can you actually turn your hobby and passion into a real career into a source of income?

140
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:27,300
And so livelihood a big part that played into just the early days of my career was definitely the internships that I was a part of.

141
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,900
We can go to the next slide.

142
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:44,600
And, so I had a chance to be able to work with complex magazine, which is no longer magazine and mainly like more of a media platform, but just again, applying my route to my interest into areas where I can apply my Skills and education that I was getting.

143
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,900
So beyond just your usual undergrad courses and art school.

144
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,300
I also did internships with the find artist named Ron McKenna's.

145
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:00,800
I had a chance to be able to work in the art Department, as an intern for complex magazine, where I learned about publishing.

146
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,000
How does advertising work?

147
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
How does, how does the advertising Department work with the editorial department, will put the, you know, design Department?

148
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,200
I had a chance to be able to work with a graphic designer that did a lot of work.

149
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,100
Graphics for Street Wear brands that I admired.

150
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:24,200
So, again, looking underneath the hood and being able to be a part of the process of some of my favorite Brands, how do they make their clothes or products?

151
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,600
What does that exact process light?

152
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:35,000
From research to inspiration, to actually designing it to getting it ready for vendor, picking colors figuring out sizing.

153
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,200
And really, like I really was fortunate to be able to work with other creators that were fortunate enough to, you know, give me a chance.

154
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,600
Chance take me under their wing and really show me their way to help me craft my eye as well.

155
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,700
When it comes to just like General design, which is really just Priceless.

156
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,500
And then, you know, fast-forward the next slide.

157
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:04,200
We kind of look at just exactly how my work my or a lot of my artwork looks like now some of the commission's I have had over the years.

158
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,800
So a lot of it is very colorful Lively lot of Storytelling.

159
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,400
It's very busy, a lot of times and a big part of how I would like to describe.

160
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:29,000
My work is very much again inspired by my roots where, you know, in York City, you're on like a subway car and there're sounds, there's people doing all sorts of things.

161
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,100
And then you have all these colorful advertisements all around you or you're walking down the street and Fifth Avenue.

162
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,400
And there's just so much stimulation.

163
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,900
But what is actually a poster or a sign on a bus?

164
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,400
Or something that actually makes you stop in your tracks and catches your attention.

165
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:53,800
And that's always a moment that I always valued even just for myself as someone who lives in a city, a busy City.

166
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:09,300
And I think that General mentality contributed a lot to my general style of work and along with, you know, a lot of, I guess just being involved in the just a, New York scene and being into fashion and music and so forth.

167
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:16,100
It's been able to just open doors for me to be able to On a lot of different types of projects in that space.

168
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,300
So what's the coolest project that your most proud of that you worked on?

169
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,200
And what was the most challenging project that I have ever learned a lot from?

170
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,400
Well, let us see the coolest one.

171
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:43,800
Well, I can say that the easiest one in the most fun one in the one that you know always gets people excited is definitely having the opportunity to be able to work with Anthony Bourdain.

172
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,000
So that was really my big break shortly.

173
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,400
After college.

174
00:20:48,800 --> 00:21:14,900
The story behind that project was and I had a friend of a friend, you know, someone was looking for an illustrator just on Facebook, and they Kind of referred me to someone who happened to be another friend, you know, all around the same age group of newly grads and, you know, not really having much access, but someone did work at the production company that handled a lot of the Travel Channel shows, including No Reservations.

175
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,100
So they had asked me to do an illustration.

176
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
It was totally free.

177
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
It was just an illustration.

178
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:27,000
We posted on Facebook, just as a flyer, to be like, hey, make sure you check out the Boston episode tonight.

179
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,100
It aired.

180
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,000
It looked great.

181
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,300
Apparently, you know people at Travel Channel loved it.

182
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,900
So I actually got called by them don't like directly, and they signed me on for an entire season.

183
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:48,900
So I had a chance to be able to watch every single episode ahead of town of time and work on a custom illustration for each episode, which do they then produce those posters and the heat signed.

184
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,100
And that was their giveaway on Facebook.

185
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,400
It was a very early days.

186
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,700
We want, I want to say like 2010-2011 before.

187
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,100
Major companies are really using social media platforms as well.

188
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,800
Communicate to Their audience.

189
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,600
So that was very exciting because you're very easy client to work with it.

190
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:14,600
He would obviously I think we're doing is a very well-known person and it and as a budding creative to be able to share that.

191
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:24,800
Hey you had a chance to be able to work on a project like this that was very valuable and helpful to be able to you know, just again continue to build my portfolio and share the types of the type of work that I was getting.

192
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,800
And then to answer your question of what was the hardest Most challenging and biggest lessons.

193
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,500
I feel like I am always learning lessons regardless.

194
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,300
I love new challenges.

195
00:22:38,100 --> 00:23:00,300
While I was going to leave you fast-forward on some slides, but essentially a big part of what I like to do today is I take the skills that I have learned over the years, the skills of illustration design print working with people just the whole 360 like 15 years of experience being in this space, you know, just building my On platforms.

196
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:08,900
So I guess it's a marriage of the skills that I have with my own personal interest.

197
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,600
So growing up, you know, loving sneakers.

198
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,000
I started a sneaker platform co-founded a speaker platform called common.

199
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,600
Ace where people get to shop from multiple sneaker retailers at once.

200
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:29,100
Because as a woman who loves to collect sneakers, it's very hard for me to find things in my size is a lot of issues when it comes to accessibility.

201
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,300
TV variety.

202
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,700
So we really wanted to create an aggregator that allowed and empowered women to butt.

203
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,200
And honestly, it's marketed to women, but men, women kids, everyone can use it.

204
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:47,300
It's just another online, aggregator for you to be able to find the product that you want, really, just trying to present ourselves as a One-Stop shop.

205
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,700
And there's always challenges there.

206
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,900
You know, I had to work with a team of people to work with different personalities.

207
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,500
Majority of our team members were women.

208
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:01,700
So it was a team of women, and I was like, oh my gosh, a lot of I usually work in a more male dominated space.

209
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:08,800
So working with different types of emotions and personalities, and especially being someone who's the co-founder and a leader in this space.

210
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:18,200
You know, I definitely had to invest a lot into communication skills and delegation and, and yeah, just a lot.

211
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:28,500
I started to read a lot more into leadership to just learn more and, and how to empower myself as a leader in that space, but that was where just definitely lots of challenges.

212
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,700
But Yeah, I kind of really like to tackle challenges, head-on.

213
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,000
I think it's exciting.

214
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,700
It's always an opportunity to learn, so I am all for it.

215
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,700
Wow.

216
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:49,100
Okay, so touching challenges leadership, you know, some, some of those things, you know, right now.

217
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:58,100
I hear you're the VP of brand of an up-and-coming brand in the tech Fitness space.

218
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,700
Could you talk to us a little bit about that?

219
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,000
And, you know, you're leading a creative team remote?

220
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:14,400
And yeah, there's I am sure there're challenges there because you know, because you meetings all day can lead to a lot of burnouts and exhaustion.

221
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,200
So absolutely.

222
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Yeah, so I have had about you.

223
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,400
10, 10, 15 years of just freelance.

224
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:29,900
And as of November of last year, I accepted my first like full-time role in a really long time.

225
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:35,200
I had a full-time job when I first graduated from college, but it's been a long time since.

226
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,700
And so it's my first time, you know getting back into direct deposit every two weeks.

227
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,900
I was like, oh my gosh, this is amazing and it doesn't help benefit for so long.

228
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,900
We just, you know, Describe freelance.

229
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,400
So it's been really exciting.

230
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,200
So as I mentioned, my title is VP of brand.

231
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,500
So I have had a chance to be able to work with this company that I deeply admire.

232
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,000
It's called myo detox.

233
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,400
We actually have a slide for them as well, and it's actually a physical therapy and Chiropractic practice.

234
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,400
We have about 11 locations in Canada, and three, and Allah.

235
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,600
We're looking to expand, you know, within the u.s.

236
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,300
Very soon, a big part of why.

237
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,300
I will tell you, kind of the whole story of how I kind of stumbled upon my oh, but just like anyone.

238
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:36,400
I know, I just quickly recapped my journey as an illustrator, but that all of that, and all of the amazing art, you saw was a lot of hours behind a computer on a desk Urban.

239
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Ah, McCleary really offset and in my very early 20s shortly after college.

240
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:59,500
I was getting shooting pains in my neck and my lower back and my wrist just from drying and using a mouse and, and I am hours at a desk, even though I loved drawing and I still do to this day love what I do and it definitely really took a toll on my body and plus, you know living in New York.

241
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,700
You carry your whole life on you all day.

242
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,300
Every day.

243
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,900
You just got it.

244
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,100
You can't have a car to stop the stick, your things in.

245
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,100
So, you carry this heavy backpack.

246
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,900
It's cold.

247
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,700
You're physically very tense.

248
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,300
So just takes a really big toll on your, on your body.

249
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:19,300
And everyone has their set of, you know, different types of injuries that their bodies kind of held on.

250
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,300
Over the years, some syrup over time and so forth.

251
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,500
So my story is not that much different and I had a PT person.

252
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,000
I was going, you know, Clinic I was seeing on and off, maybe a chiropractor when I was living in New York.

253
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,200
When I had moved to LA.

254
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,100
I had to find a new PT and a new place.

255
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:41,100
So I stumbled upon my oh and I had one session was completely life-changing.

256
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,400
I think what makes them extremely different for me at that time.

257
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,300
Was, I have never been told that there's hope I never II thought that.

258
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,100
At the pain and discomfort that I experienced was normal.

259
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,000
And that relief was temporary.

260
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:05,100
And a big part of our entire mission is really just getting the world moving helping people understand like moving every day.

261
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:15,400
So I started investing in my 0 in terms of just for myself as a customer, and I was going there once a month over the course of three years.

262
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,300
I was, you know, work was really, really busy lots of hours.

263
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,200
The desk.

264
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,000
I was flying once a month.

265
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,900
I was going between LA and New York.

266
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,600
Very often.

267
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,700
This is pretty covid.

268
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,100
And that was really the one relief that I found were it.

269
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,000
It future-proof my body.

270
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,400
Meaning allowed me to continue doing what I love, which is drying working.

271
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,100
I never want to stop doing that.

272
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,100
And now, you know, obviously, I am an active person as well.

273
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,300
But this was just that additional supplement.

274
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:49,200
I needed in my routine just like how someone flosses their teeth every day, you know.

275
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Brush your teeth that it's just part of the maintenance or you have a therapist that you speak with that supports your mental health.

276
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:01,000
This was my staple and my everything in terms of just caring for my body.

277
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:11,000
So the same type of treatment that a Superstar athlete would get you know on the Courtside during a game of physical therapy treatment.

278
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,000
We get we package that for everyday people like you and I whether you're a plumber or a lawyer or a celebrity Superstar singer or whatever it is.

279
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,100
I will have a one body for the rest of our lives.

280
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,600
How can we continue to care for it?

281
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,700
And essentially, you know, learn more about it because my body is different from yours.

282
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,100
Are not their anatomies different.

283
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,000
We have different habits.

284
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:44,800
So, I always had this feeling of what guys, you would love to work for this company one day and I kind of got to place with my freelance work, where I had some really good years.

285
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,100
I started working like seven days a week with freelance and started to get really crazy.

286
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:57,000
And you know, I in many ways also felt like I work with a lot of amazing Brands and kind of reach it.

287
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,100
My own little ceiling and wanted more of a challenge for myself because Beyond just illustration design.

288
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,600
I also have more of a knack for strategy as well.

289
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:21,000
So I have been very fortunate to be able to join their team and, you know, support on their creative Endeavors and support on some of their marketing and strategy initiatives, which Just been so fulfilling.

290
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:28,400

295
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,200
Yeah.

296
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,700
Let me know when they're in Vegas.

297
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,500
Yeah.

298
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,300
Yeah, we could do that too.

299
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,000
That's true.

300
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,700
Okay, next trip to La.

301
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,900
So, you know, you're leading this creative team remotely.

302
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,700
How are you yourself?

303
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,400
Preventing burnout and from getting fatigued from meeting after meeting.

And how are you keeping your teams engaged and inspired?

305
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:21,800
Yeah, so I mentioned earlier that Our companies also Canadian.

306
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,200
So a lot of our team members are split between US and Canada.

307
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,200
There's a lot of different technical laws when it comes to.

308
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,300
Like how people house just to Medical Physical Therapy field is in Canada versus u.s.

309
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,000
So there's so you're almost working with two different companies.

310
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Plus you have different people who are in different countries with in different time zones.

311
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:49,200
So, you know, obviously, especially since, so we have kind of been working very virtuous.

312
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:55,100
So, for a while, we never actually had a home-based office, but with that obviously comes lots of challenges.

313
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,200
So covid-19 a huge shock for us.

314
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,200
But yeah, like I think, you know, all of us definitely use your usual platforms to be able to communicate.

315
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,900
And, for myself, personally.

316
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,700
I am obsessed with productivity.

317
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:18,900
So I read a lot into productivity with some of my favorite Outlets are like to do this task to do it as a great blood.

318
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,700
So it Close blog that I love to use.

319
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:29,200
But I love to read their blogs, just to learn like little tips and tricks, big fan of Cal Newport as well, the author of deep work.

320
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:41,800
So I am always looking into ways to be able to optimize my workflow, and she's ways to be able to improve how work of course, burnout is very common in a big part of how I like to manage.

321
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:49,200
That is again, like through that education and awareness by researching and learning more about music.

322
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:55,300
Lots of resources for more than anything, you know, you have to remember you're in control, and I am always all about calibrating.

323
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,500
So I don't know if you're into productivity, but there's you know, Cal Newports, deep work.

324
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,100
There's also getting things done by David Allen.

325
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,700
There's a new show at the Pomodoro Technique.

326
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:10,000
There's so many different types of techniques and sometimes it's for me, it's more.

327
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:18,600
So just exposing myself to all of them and then testing and trying and seeing which one's work for me in certain times and certain phases of my life and my career.

328
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,900
And work mode and that helps me protect my time.

329
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:37,500
And, you know, for example, blocking out, certain type of whether there's everything from, you know, time blocking today, theming to there's so many different types of day.

330
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:44,600
Theming is if you dedicate specific days to different parts of your work, so Mondays are specifically for accounting.

331
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,100
Operational stuff.

332
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,200
Tuesdays are for me to do deep work, creative work.

333
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,800
He think, no cause that day is great and days for me to do any type of marketing Social Media stuff.

334
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,100
So that doesn't work for me as well.

335
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:03,700
But, you know, again, to each their own, there's no like one answer, everyone's different, and they have different circumstances, especially in their home.

336
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,900
So, it's just so great to be able to expose yourself to these resources.

337
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,000
So, that's definitely something.

338
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:24,900
I bring into the way, I work with my team, and I am also always thinking about ways that I can support them on prioritization specially when you're trying to fulfill Creative needs for such a, you know, so pretty large company to some extent.

339
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,900
There's a lot of different clinics, a lot of locations.

340
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,500
Lots of people needing things from you.

341
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,400
How can we build?

342
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:38,800
This is kind of the productivity part again, how can we build proper systems and infrastructures so that there's efficient workflow?

343
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,900
So I am really into notion.

344
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:49,199
I am really the Trello and asada and basically, I love all those types of apps and building a healthy Foundation that helps manage the entire.

345
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,699
Fire massive amount of workloads that are coming in.

346
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:59,500
So I am always, I don't, I always kind of, I am constantly doing but General, like, business, hygiene housekeeping.

347
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:06,500
Cleaning up my own house is nothing to be honest, but I am from a business perspective.

348
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:12,000
I am always just, you know, pruning away and cleaning up because it's like doing your laundry.

349
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,100
It's like, you know, just general maintenance and I know that's definitely like helps to support our teams.

350
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,900
And I think when we can Speak of where way, where we lead by example as well.

351
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,500
And also share those resources.

352
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:36,900
It definitely helps to create a paradigm shift and also creates has shifted being just a general culture of your team because you can do everything, but you can't do everything.

353
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,900
So how do I?

354
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,200
Like I never say any ideas really bad.

355
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,600
I kind of just shelf ideas sometimes, but I always keep a little record of it.

356
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,400
So then we need to like refresh and revisit the, it will be there.

357
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,600
You can't, you had Idea for reason, we can always revisit it at a later time.

358
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,800
But yeah, I think, you know, just, I myself and just a huge advocate for productivity.

359
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,800
So, definitely tried to bring that into conversations as much as I can with my team.

360
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
I love that.

361
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Well, we're almost wrapping up at time here.

362
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:19,300
But for any of those that have questions for Sophia, go ahead and drop your questions either, even in the chat, or there is a Q&A tab up there, you know.

363
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,500
Feel free to ask any questions in the meantime.

364
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,000
Sophia.

365
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I am curious.

366
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,500
You know what's next?

367
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Like, I know you have got the VP of brand thing, but you always got something else too.

368
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,900
You know there.

369
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,200
What's next for you?

370
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:39,900
What is what's your next like North Star that you want to accomplish?

371
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,600
Yeah, I think as many as different hats that I have worn over the years.

372
00:36:47,100 --> 00:37:00,700
I feel like the North Star has always been Present, you know, using the skills that I have finding, you know, speaking in a very passionate authentic way, that's always true to myself and my own personal interests, and I just really love storytelling.

373
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:07,400
I think what's next for me is always just learning new skills, and continuing to harness those skills.

374
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,500
I think like definitely building in this Rule, still pretty recent, you know, it's only been like, 7 months, but I love it.

375
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:28,500
And I would love to be able to see my sin, and I think the most exciting part about my role, and, We're positioned out today is I really see the company's growth and actually see my own skill sets being a part of that company's growth and that's the most exciting part.

376
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
So I think I will be here for a while.

377
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,300
I am still freelancing on the side.

378
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:37,900
I am actually going to be doing, I am going to be painting at like a football game tomorrow.

379
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,000
Wait, this is really tomorrow evening.

380
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,100
Yeah, so it's called secret walls.

381
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,500
They have artists kind of battle each other.

382
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,300
So, so you team up with an artist, and we each get a side of a wall.

383
00:37:49,500 --> 00:38:03,700
We created look so that creative outlet and need to draw a great will always be there and thankfully the opportunity still come about, and I am still working on some fun collections with some sneaker brands that are going to be coming out next year.

384
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,300
It's all, it's all happening and it's all doable.

385
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,800
And yeah, I would say like right now freelance is fine.

386
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:22,100
And then fighting I am still doing it on the side by my biggest focus is just to really make sure the whole world knows about While detox, love it.

387
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,600
Okay, and it's a challenge.

388
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,700
It's always a challenge.

389
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:29,400
And I feel like my, I am always telling myself, like, could I be doing more?

390
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:36,300
And I think it's because it's not as easily fulfilled as like me, getting a great job, getting all the Press.

391
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,400
It's like I have to work in a whole different way, and I am really enjoying the challenge.

392
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,300
Mmm.

393
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,900
We will all the best to you.

394
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,600

00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,600
We're so grateful that you went to go.

396
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,000
A little sliver of your time to be with us today.

397

And we wish you all the best in your journey and painting and illustrating and all the fun creative things you get to do so beautiful.

399
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500

00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:19,800

Willie Nelson, you know, come on.

419
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,700
I got a whole cast of characters.

420
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,700
Nice.

421
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,200
Nice.

422
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,600
They're all kicking it with us, huh?

423
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,300
That's it.

424
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,000
That's great.

425
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,400
All right, so, what drink are we making today?

426
00:39:52,700 --> 00:40:02,200
So we are going to make bubbles all day because anytime is a good time for bubbles, and we love it.

427
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,200
Easy to make easy to recreate.

428
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,100
Make it home.

429
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,700
Have it any time of the day?

430
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,200
So good.

431
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,700
All right, we will take it away for us.

432
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,500
Awesome.

433
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,000
Thanks, Gina.

434
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,500
Good to see you.

435
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,100
What's up?

436
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,800
Everybody?

437
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,200
I am pip.

438
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,800
I am a Creator bordega.

439
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,900
Cocktail Club and author.

440
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:25,600
Of Raise Your Spirits cocktail book all about crafting a good cocktail at home.

441
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,900
You don't have to spend hundreds of dollars on equipment.

442
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:40,200
You probably have everything you need right in your kitchen to craft a good cocktail part of a Hospitality Group in Asbury, Park, New Jersey, and we created this Cocktail Club.

443
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:48,900
When we had some free time over the past two years when our restaurants and our Bars were closed, and we wanted to reach out to everybody.

444
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,200
In the virtual land that we couldn't, we couldn't connect with on site and just talk about Cocktails.

445
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,200
So yeah, thanks for having me today.

446
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,200
Hope you guys are been making some good cocktails at home.

447
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:08,000
But like I said it's easy to do and you have everything you need right in your kitchen.

448
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:08,800
Today.

449
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,700
We are making bubbles all day.

450
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:18,800
So this kind of good cocktail you can make as a mocktail or as a, you know, just a regular cocktail as well.

451
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,900
It is very versatile.

452
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,500
This by switching out a few different ingredients.

453
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,100
Yeah.

454
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,000
So we like to go over what we have behind our bars when you can use at home.

455
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,100
If you don't have the right equipment.

456
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,700
Like I said, you probably have everything.

457
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,500
You need right next to you.

458
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,600
We're going to shake up this cocktail.

459
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:47,300
So I am going to use a Boston style Shaker set, but more popular homes Shaker is that cobbler style?

460
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,400
That's got that top with the built-in strainer.

461
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,500
You don't have anything to shake with, it's fine.

462
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,800
You just need something that's going to lock in your ice in your ingredients.

463
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:01,000
We use a protein drink Shaker that's collecting dust in your cabinet.

464
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,600
If you use a mason jar, just want to get that proper chill and dilution.

465
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,100
And yeah.

466
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,200
You other things that you need some frozen water.

467
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,500
Make sure you have some ice handy.

468
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,300
When we're making drinks at home.

469
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,900
I like to keep our ice stored in some freezer.

470
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:30,200
Eggs, just to keep any aromatics, my refrigerator off of our ice out of our cocktails, but always having some new ice from Cocktail very popular.

471
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:37,500
So if you're having a cocktail session cocktail party, sure you get enough ice ready and good clean Spirit.

472
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,800
What's great about this cocktail is that it's very versatile?

473
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,200
If you want to use vodka you can use Jin.

474
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,400
You can wrong news wila.

475
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:56,300
We love tequila, but the original recipe calls for vodka is very Kind of, like I said, versatile cocktail, but you can always just lean on whatever spirit that you like best.

476
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,200
Of course.

477
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,000
We're going to be adding some bubbles to some sparkling wine.

478
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,400
We have got a kava root.

479
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,500
So a little dryer.

480
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,100
Not too sweet, not to overpower the cocktail.

481
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,600
Now, if you wanted to make a cocktail, all we have to do is, you know, not, add your spirit.

482
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:27,100
And substitute your champagne or sparkling wine with Soda, the nice little bubbly cocktail, some ingredients that we will be using as well is a honey syrup.

483
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,000
Now instead of using just raw honey.

484
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,300
Honey tends to like stick to the Shaker.

485
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,600
Even stick to the ice.

486
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,200
You make a honey syrup, which is just equal parts of honey and water.

487
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,900
This to dilute that honey.

488
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:47,900
That makes it much easier to aerate and dilute in your cocktail and mixes much better and you still get that nice sweetness.

489
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,900
We're also using some fresh.

490
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,900
And squeezed, lemon juice makes all the difference in the world.

491
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,700
Make sure you have fresh Citrus in your cocktails.

492
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:03,300
Don't use it against us, controlling the ingredients not using any artificial mixers or filling up on a ton of juice.

493
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:10,100
You want to get some fresh Citrus in there and not even have to use that much to get that nice tart flavor in there.

494
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:19,100
We're going to be using lemon juice and what I like to do, with our lemons, you know, whether using hand juicer for juicing, it by this hand.

495
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,700
Am I like to keep the peels for last-minute Expressions on a cocktail?

496
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:29,000
So there's a lot of great flavors and fragrances that live in the oils of our citrus fruits.

497
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,800
So what I would do is just grab a peeler, as a y-shaped.

498
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,100
Peeler great for citrus.

499
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:38,200
Fruits can use any kind of Veggie peeler, or just a paring knife?

500
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,200
No, just taking off a nice P, like that.

501
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,700
I am going to keep it to the side and I will garnish my cocktail with this.

502
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:50,900
But using all those great oils for fragrance and for a little bit of zesty flavor.

503
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,200
So we're making a cocktails all about balance.

504
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,400
So we want to have our most important tool is are measuring utensil few things.

505
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,200
You can use.

506
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,400
We use a jigger.

507
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:12,400
This is a Japanese cone style Jigger, has different volume denominations and even has some nice etchings inside from a half ounce, three-quarter ounce and so on.

508
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:19,900
But if you don't have a jigger, use a measuring spoon, tablespoon is equivalent to a half an ounce.

509
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,200
So easy way to play.

510
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:21,800
A along.

511
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:42,300
Make a cocktail this by using a measuring spoon or if you have something small measuring cups, but either way, if they seem most important utensil just so you can consistently recreate that cocktail, no matter how we like to, you know, whatever you're using, and then tend to your palate.

512
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,400
So if you like things a little less interesting, little more sweet.

513
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,100
You can manipulate those flavors to make it the way you like it each time.

514
00:45:51,400 --> 00:46:05,000
Then switching out some ingredients, but following these template makes you know, just a little better at going off and crafting, your own cocktail, but all the cocktails and our bars are our own recipes that we want to make.

515
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,300
Sure that guess has that same experience, no matter who bartending.

516
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,300
So we're always measuring at hot.

517
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,500
Yeah, I guess let us make the bubbles all day.

518
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,200
Shall we one thing to note?

519
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,000
You know that club.

520
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,800
So, Soda that sparkling wine that never goes in the shake.

521
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:32,000
Okay, just like we don't shake up and a beer or a bottle of wine or anything carbonated.

522
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,800
We don't shake so that will go in after we strain out our cocktail.

523
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,600
We also like to build our cocktails dry so high schools in last.

524
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,400
Once, your ice in your ingredients, meet clock starts.

525
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:44,900
Ticking.

526
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,100
Ice will start melting.

527
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,900
It could over dilute your cocktails.

528
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,000
We only add ice once.

529
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,200
You're ready to start shape.

530
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,200
Also, kind of flavor up this, not do with different ingredients.

531
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:10,400
But if you want to model in some different berries, for a little bit of spice pepper, we can reach to your liquor shelf and grab a different lock or Louise, only use like a little bit at a time because a little goes, a long way with these different reporters.

532
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,000
And editors.

533
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,700
We're going to use some a parole.

534
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,900
An hour cocktail, it's completely optional.

535
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:31,500
But I like the after all very popular because the Apple s grits, it's a red bidder from the Amore family, adds a nice little kind of Bittersweet component and a nice little pretty cute tour cocktail.

536
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,900
You're not familiar with the after all.

537
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:41,000
This is its a nice kind of way of introducing yourself to the mares are red bitters that go into our cocktails.

538
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,100
It's older brother.

539
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:46,500
I would say Campari very better, very aggressive.

540
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,300
After all is a nice little softer way, go bad it.

541
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,900
But this only would be using a half an ounce just to kind of give a nice little balance.

542
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,400
All right.

543
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:03,900
So first I am going to add our honey syrup and same thing with all the cores are syrups little goes a long way.

544
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,700
And I am just going to have a half ounce of a touch of Sweetness in the cockpit.

545
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,200
So I have got my honey syrup ready to go.

546
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,900
I am just going to measure out a half ounce.

547
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,200
Go right in the shaker.

548
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:29,400
Notice, I am also using my least expensive ingredients first just in case I have a little spill precious booze isn't going to go to waste just yet.

549
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:41,400
So I have my sweet with my honey syrup, and I am going to have my Citrus, and I am going to add three-quarter ounce of our fresh squeezed lemon juice .75.

550
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:55,300
So making a traditional sour style cocktail first similar to like a bee's knees.

551
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:03,500
You always want your sweet, your citrus and your spirit, the main components to your sour style cocktails.

552
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,000
Bee's knees Margarita's Daiquiris gimlets.

553
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,800
Those are also our style cocktails all that same template with those three ingredients.

554
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,300
So I have got my sweet.

555
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,800
I have got my Citrus now, my spirit whatever is Andy that you'd like to use.

556
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:24,400
Like I said, very versatile, I am going to use a silver rum in this and with this, we're going to go an ounce and a half.

557
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,700
Now you can make this as low alcohol as you like to just want like a, you know, low ABV.

558
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,300
We call them loaf on top sales, and she don't want to go too aggressive.

559
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,300
So I mean, it's just a Thursday.

560
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,500
Thursday is new Friday.

561
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,000
Let us go one and a half ounces.

562
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,400
I am going to go, 1.5.

563
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,300
Now cocktail just like that is good to go.

564
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,900
But I am going to add a little bit extra little, you know, pop to this cocktail.

565
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,100
I am going to add some after all and just going to use a half ounce.

566
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:13,000
Now, if you have something like an elderflower liqueur, Ginger liqueur, maybe a berry liqueur again, just use a little bit half hours, just to give that little extra pop of flavor.

567
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,800
So, This doesn't want to come off.

568
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:27,100
All right, so in cases like these, when you can't get the cap off of your bottle, just run it under some warm water and that will lose.

569
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:31,500
The sugars that are keeping this from coming off the top of my bottle.

570
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,900
Live TV, anything can happen.

571
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,400
So I am going to opt to not even have the after all my cocktail this time.

572
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,200
Good thing.

573
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,700
That's an optional component.

574
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,900
So cocktail is ready to shape.

575
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,300
I am just going to add some ice, just enough, ice the top, the components in my shaker.

576
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:07,500
And then once we lock in our shaker, if you want to get a good Vigor shake for about 10 seconds, that's just enough to aerate.

577
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,700
The, all your components, all your ingredients, you get that good.

578
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,000
Chill.

579
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,500
And you always want to add a little bit die.

580
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:13,900
Lucien.

581
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,300
You want to get a little water to into the cocktail as well.

582
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,800
So lock it in.

583
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,100
No, don't shake it at somebody, you know, I don't want to weaponize these cocktails.

584
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,100
Always try to get your hands on it and Get away.

585
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,600
So, check it out, guys.

586
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,800
Ice hope.

587
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:43,500
All right.

588
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,700
So check it.

589
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,600
However, you want to.

590
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:55,100
Yeah, go ahead the Shaker if you want, but any kind of glass eight-year at home heirs, have it out of the coffee, mug, have it on the rocks and rocks this.

591
00:51:55,100 --> 00:52:01,400
If you like, I have got this nice Coupe glass that I would like to turn it into just been begging to be used.

592
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:01,700
Now.

593
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,000
I am going to use a Hawthorn style strainer.

594
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,500
This just says, he's flexible coil sits right on top of my shaker.

595
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:14,400
You don't have a strainer, you know, you can use a couple Forks that would Finance training at your cocktail.

596
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,500
The Strain this out first.

597
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:31,100
Notice the drink right now is great to drink on its own, not a ton of volume, not filling up on a lot of artificial mixers are, you know, ton of juice?

598
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,700
It's a much easier to drink another one, but I want to add some bubbles.

599
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:43,200
Now if you just made it with lemon and honey, and no booze and you have a nice little kind of funny lemonade, which is fine.

600
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,200
Just want to add some club soda.

601
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,000
I am going to be adding some.

602
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,800
F****** wine and use about like 2.

603
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,300
Oz.

604
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,300
You don't have to measure it.

605
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,200
You can kind of just give it a little lift.

606
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:56,500
Now.

607
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,500
You don't want to add too much.

608
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,700
Big can't take away.

609
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,800
You can always add more.

610
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,100
So I am just going to give it a little lift.

611
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,900
It's a nice little effervescence.

612
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,000
For the cocktail.

613
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:20,800
Now the last piece I am going to use that lemon wedge, or I am sorry, lemon peel that I would save and by pinching it a holding it over.

614
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:38,600
The cocktail with a bright yellow side, down the release those oils on top of the cocktail that's going to help with the your the aroma and just a little extra of citrus zest and might not be able to see it here, but it's little fireworks will shoot.

615
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,000
Tick-Tock tell just by pinching it.

616
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,400
So, put it in there.

617
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,000
Those are fireworks.

618
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,700
BBB over your cocktail.

619
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,400
And you can either leave it in there as a garnish or get rid of it.

620
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,400
Here's there.

621
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,000
