00:16:32,603 --> 00:16:33,403
Hello.

2
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,603
Oh, is my camera glitching?

3
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:51,803
Hi, everyone.

4
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:53,403
Am I showing up?

5
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:57,103
Alright, I know I had some camera glitches there earlier, give me a Lindsay.

6
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:58,003
Thank you.

7
00:16:58,303 --> 00:16:59,003
Hello.

8
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:01,303

9
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:03,803
We are so excited about today's event.

10
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:04,903
Thank you, Thomas.

11
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:08,303
I love the thumbs UPS, appreciate it.

12
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:12,203
And it looks like we have got folks tuning in from all over.

13
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:19,502
I am actually here in Honolulu Hawaii and it is 7 AM in the morning.

14
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:21,303
So It's nice to see.

15
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:29,703
We got folks in Toronto, Thomas you're at NYC Morgan, Seattle, Houston, Oregon all over.

16
00:17:30,003 --> 00:17:31,703
Aloha everyone.

17
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:33,903
It's lovely to have you here.

18
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:38,303
And our topic today is a really special one.

19
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:45,103
It's about the power of purpose and how you can foster a greater sense of purpose with your employee.

20
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:48,503
So I am really excited about our guest today.

21
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:52,803
Her name is Olivia, He is the VP of partner, success, with d.

22
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:58,203
Before I bring her up, we wanted to do a quick little housekeeping check.

23
00:17:58,303 --> 00:18:15,103
So note that we have a Q&A Tab and at any given moment, feel free to drop your questions in that Tab and towards the end of this event will probably pull in some of those questions and answer them for you with Olivia here.

24
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:20,703
There's also a help tab, so if you're trying to navigate the platform you're here on, welcome to Day.

25
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:24,203
And if you have questions, feel free to drop them in there.

26
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:28,703
Now, let us kick off with a quick poll.

27
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:38,403
Have you participated in any giving activities, virtual volunteering donations?

28
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:48,003
Both or not yet, feel free to start dropping in your votes there, and we will quickly be able to see oh, okay, both.

29
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:59,803
Alright, so some of you have participated in Virtual volunteering and donations, refining trend-wise, we're hearing that more folks in the last couple.

30
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:06,803
Years have actually been doing donations over virtual volunteering Olivia will give us more points on that to come.

31
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:29,703
So with that, you know, today's Workforce is looking for that common greater purpose and according to Deloitte 67 percent of employees, look for socially responsible companies and companies who meet that need are seeing at least a 40 percent Spike.

32
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:30,903
In retention.

33
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:38,303
So I am asking the question, we're all asking the questions, how can we build a community that helps our employees gain?

34
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,003
This greater sense of purpose.

35
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:42,803
Meaning belonging fulfillment at work.

36
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:49,003
So with that, I love to bring to the stage Olivia VP of partner success at deed.

37
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:50,403
Hello.

38
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:51,403
Hello.

39
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:52,203
Hi Jenna.

40
00:19:52,203 --> 00:19:54,003
Thank you so much for having me.

41
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:55,603
Absolutely.

42
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:57,403
It's great to see you.

43
00:19:57,803 --> 00:19:59,803
And where are you tuning in from?

44
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:02,803
I am in Park City Utah.

45
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:07,103
So not quite as tropical as Hawaii.

46
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:08,803
But pretty dang good.

47
00:20:08,803 --> 00:20:12,403
We got the mountains and some good Sunshine, so not complaining.

48
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:14,003
That's awesome.

49
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:16,003
You taught is beautiful.

50
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:19,603
So is it and it's good for you there?

51
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:33,303
I promised I would try to bring my coworker so hopefully that's Just a good kickoff wheat.

52
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:34,703
7 AM morning.

53
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:36,303
Thank you.

54
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:38,603
What's your co-workers name is?

55
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:39,703
Name is daily.

56
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:46,803
So daily you think he's gonna behave himself during our conversation but if not we will just see what he has to say.

57
00:20:48,703 --> 00:21:02,403
Awesome, well, he's welcome to participate and if he's got a question, feel free to bring him on any given point, and we well yeah, I like xandria we id'd we have Frou-frou dog, and cat.

58
00:21:02,403 --> 00:21:03,603
Really, any animal.

59
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:06,403
It's the role that if they're in the room, they have to be on the video.

60
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:10,303
So we love it to love that.

61
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:19,103
Alright, so Olivia, we saw this, the stats that came through a lot of folks participated in donations.

62
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:28,603
And there's some, a good amount of folks that also did both virtual volunteering and donations, just talking quickly about what you're seeing with the trends.

63
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:33,803
And, you know, you had mentioned to me that donations are a lot more.

64
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,703
Those are taking place more than virtual volunteering.

65
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:38,003
Can you speak to that a little bit?

66
00:21:38,303 --> 00:21:51,403
Yeah, I mean obviously we have all lived it the past two years have been insane for so many reasons, but in the giving an impact Community, it's certainly been interesting to see.

67
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:59,203
I mean, obviously at the very beginning and even into the past couple months, folks really have moved away from volunteering.

68
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:15,603
Just certainly hard for nonprofits, like soup kitchens or like tutoring programs are doing a lot of things in person, but it has opened up the opportunity for more virtual volunteering and some more skills-based volunteering, which is super cool and exciting.

69
00:22:15,803 --> 00:22:22,903
And then the other though, like really big push that we have seen is just through donations and so much generosity over the past couple of years.

70
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:29,303
I mean, starting with covid but you know, most recently we have seen a lot of help going towards Ukraine.

71
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:42,403
And like most recently, some things with gun violence and so people kind of putting their money where their mouth is over the past couple years because they weren't able to do it in person or hands on Gotcha, that's really interesting.

72
00:22:42,603 --> 00:22:51,603
So I am going to take us back a few notches and elevation up here because we are talking about social impact Corporate social responsibility.

73
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:56,603
And, you know, there are some stats that we just read off that, obviously, make it important.

74
00:22:56,603 --> 00:23:03,903
But I would love to hear from your perspective, considering the changes are taking place with work remote hybrid.

75
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:05,103
All of these things?

76
00:23:05,903 --> 00:23:25,903
Why is social impact so important for companies to be considering Yeah, such a good question and I feel like we could just talk about that all day, but I think for me, there's kind of and for deed, there's like two different parts that we think about one is like really on the impact component.

77
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:28,403
And I have seen some folks and some folks that I know from the nonprofit.

78
00:23:28,403 --> 00:23:40,403
So they know this even better is like when you have Collective impact, you can do so much more good and that goes for volunteering or donations, when you like getting more brains in the room, more ideas floating around.

79
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:40,803
Around.

80
00:23:40,803 --> 00:23:44,903
If like you need to help a non-profit with a marketing campaign, like that's always going to be better.

81
00:23:44,903 --> 00:23:50,603
And then obviously with donations, the more people that you have contributing, the more matching, you have four more companies.

82
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:58,903
The more you're able to do so it's just like better for your local community and our communities at large.

83
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:08,003
But then the other side that we have seen, which like companies like Deloitte have awesome stats around, it is really around retention recruitment.

84
00:24:08,003 --> 00:24:10,003
Fulfillment at work.

85
00:24:10,603 --> 00:24:26,403
Like being able to keep people in their jobs, I think especially with like the millennial generation and then gen Z is now entering the workforce, and we have seen those Generations caring about this even more especially when it comes to their job.

86
00:24:26,403 --> 00:24:31,603
So they're like, you know, we don't want to work for a company that doesn't stand for the similar things that we stand for.

87
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:36,003
And, so, in that way, it's really important to like, HR teams.

88
00:24:36,003 --> 00:24:42,703
People team to really, make sure that impact is built into what the He's doing mmm.

89
00:24:43,403 --> 00:24:56,603
And as far as trends that you're seeing of do's and do Nots as companies start to get more intentional about pulling social impact into their business strategies.

90
00:24:57,503 --> 00:24:59,403
What are some dues do?

91
00:24:59,403 --> 00:25:01,203
Not yeah.

92
00:25:01,403 --> 00:25:02,003
Good.

93
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:02,903
Good question.

94
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:10,003
So, well, first of all, maybe I can give to like a little bit of a little brief about deed because I think that will help you.

95
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:10,203
Yes.

96
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:12,303
Why we hear about this?

97
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,703
And because this is what we're doing on a day-to-day basis.

98
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:17,703
So deed is a social impact platform.

99
00:25:17,703 --> 00:25:24,003
We connect nonprofits companies and employees and really help them do good.

100
00:25:24,503 --> 00:25:29,203
And then, when once, and while all that goat is happening, we track all of it.

101
00:25:29,203 --> 00:25:32,103
So on the admin side, you can see all the good that's happening.

102
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:40,103
And so we get to work with all the teams that are driving that to come up with really cool, creative ideas for how to launch that, how to push it out.

103
00:25:40,303 --> 00:25:42,603
How to get people more engaged.

104
00:25:42,903 --> 00:25:52,303
And so that's kind of why we see some of these Trends and where things are going and know a little bit more about like the best practices in this impact community.

105
00:25:53,803 --> 00:26:04,103
And I would say, we talked about kind of like that shift to donations, but I think that in a broader sense is just about being agile, you know, three years ago.

106
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:10,203
You potentially could have had a program that was like, we're 40% in person volunteering.

107
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,303
Virtual and 40% donations.

108
00:26:12,603 --> 00:26:29,903
And you know once the pandemic happened that would have totally gotten blown up, and so we always talk about like how can you be super proactive and say like these are the things that our company really cares about and stands for but then also build into your program like how can I be reactive?

109
00:26:29,903 --> 00:26:36,403
Because you can never plan, you know, disaster relief or like I mentioned gun control.

110
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:48,103
Lots of folks are talking about that, you know, hurricanes Earthquakes like those you know, God forbid moment that have to happen and so being able to build kind of that agility into it.

111
00:26:48,403 --> 00:26:50,403
I think is super important.

112
00:26:51,703 --> 00:27:06,403
And then in terms of like where we kind of see things going, they talk like we talked a lot about employees having voice and choice but also companies being able to be super intentional with we're like they're matching dollars or going.

113
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:09,303
So something that I think has been super cool.

114
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:09,903
Is that?

115
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:19,003
Companies are kind of like narrowing down on the nonprofits and organizations that they want to support because it's something that like really aligns to their business.

116
00:27:19,003 --> 00:27:23,903
So like banks, for example, I have seen them do a lot of cool stuff with financial literacy.

117
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:32,103
We work with Airbnb who such an incredible company, and they do so much with impact, but because they're in housing, they can do a lot with refugees.

118
00:27:32,303 --> 00:27:38,103
And with like after disaster relief, they are always there to help another company sonder.

119
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:39,303
It does the same thing.

120
00:27:40,303 --> 00:27:46,503
Like Adidas is another one of our wonderful companies, and they like work very specifically with sports-related nonprofit.

121
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:55,503
And so, in terms of like a trend, I feel like just getting a little bit deeper and more intentional with like what you as a company really cares about.

122
00:27:55,903 --> 00:28:03,303
I think is what we're going to see things going, but also allowing your employees to feel like their voices heard to.

123
00:28:03,303 --> 00:28:09,903
So, potentially you have like an open program for General matching, but you give to X2 sports-related nonprofits.

124
00:28:09,903 --> 00:28:11,303
If your A sport.

125
00:28:11,503 --> 00:28:12,503
Ah, gotcha.

126
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:14,103
Interesting.

127
00:28:14,803 --> 00:28:24,903
So the strategy you basically want to provide opportunity, multiple opportunities of how an employee can participate and get involved.

128
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,203
Yeah, 100%.

129
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:33,503
I mean, I think if you're able the, the wonderful thing that I love about deed is that were able to work with all types of companies.

130
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:39,603
So super small and then also really, really big Fortune 50 companies.

131
00:28:39,803 --> 00:29:04,803
And so it's going to look a little bit different, like the smaller companies just might not have as many resources but there's a lot of ways that you can still direct and support your employees and giving but 100% I think you said it better than I ever could like giving lots of opportunities for your employees to give back and then like particularly highlighting the stuff that you have as a company care about, I think is an awesome way to pair the two.

132
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:10,703
So let us pull that thread a little bit for Shins.

133
00:29:10,703 --> 00:29:21,003
That may just be starting to figure out what is the right nonprofit to be a part of, you know, where do we donate to?

134
00:29:21,603 --> 00:29:23,103
What is a good starting point?

135
00:29:23,903 --> 00:29:31,403
How do they you have talked about super powers before helping, you know, organizations identify what that looks like?

136
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,103
Could you speak to a little bit about that?

137
00:29:33,403 --> 00:29:34,403
Yes, 100%.

138
00:29:34,403 --> 00:29:44,903
So that I would say is like one of our favorite things to help companies do is it so exciting when a program is just Starting it feels like the world is your oyster but it also I think can be pretty intimidating.

139
00:29:44,903 --> 00:29:47,803
It's like we could literally do anything so what do we do?

140
00:29:49,103 --> 00:30:01,003
And so yes, we talked a lot about this idea of the superpower and it's basically like what does your company do better than anybody else or really different from anybody else?

141
00:30:01,203 --> 00:30:05,003
And how can you harness it to for good?

142
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:09,303
And so we usually talk about like three different steps for it.

143
00:30:09,503 --> 00:30:23,803
One And this is generally for companies who are just starting out, but also could be if you're looking to Pivot a little bit more or even just to like realign your social impact mission and vision and how that's playing out.

144
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:30,403
So the first thing would just be like thinking about your company's social impact Mission, like, what are you trying to change?

145
00:30:30,403 --> 00:30:32,703
What do you really care about as a company?

146
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:39,503
And we went about this before, but, like, obviously, extra bonus points if it's also what a lot of your employees care about.

147
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:46,503
That's why I think, Like the bank example is really cool, is obviously folks who are very entrenched in this like Financial world.

148
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:55,303
And so financial literacy, I have seen be a really cool cause because a lot of those folks really care about that and are super knowledgeable.

149
00:30:55,303 --> 00:31:09,403
So like understanding what your social impact mission is obviously ensuring all the execs are bought in bonus, if all the employees are super Baden and this kind of like anchors, what your superpower is for?

150
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:10,103
Like what are you trying to?

151
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:11,203
Change what you try to do?

152
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:16,803
And then the next one would be identifying your company's actual superpower.

153
00:31:16,903 --> 00:31:30,103
So I actually already gave some examples, you know, with companies that we have worked with, but Deeds, I think is more around our platform and, you know, our platform connects people.

154
00:31:30,103 --> 00:31:35,903
So we connect nonprofits company's employees and so that platform allows people to do good.

155
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:46,603
And, so I would say our platform is our super power, but for different people, you know, A Consulting Group like their people would be their superpower and that, you know, they can help nonprofits, do all sorts of different things.

156
00:31:47,103 --> 00:31:57,003
So it could be your people, your product, really anything, and so you want to identify that and so once you have it designs defied, your kind of like Mission and then your superpower.

157
00:31:57,203 --> 00:32:06,603
Then it's really putting it into action, which is obviously the hard part, but it's really collaborating across the board employees Executives.

158
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:10,103
Pulling in employee resource groups, your local community.

159
00:32:11,303 --> 00:32:15,503
So that they, you know, so that you can leverage your superpower in service of your mission.

160
00:32:15,503 --> 00:32:18,503
So hopefully that helps a little bit in terms of like a 1-2-3.

161
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:27,403
If there's anybody who's just starting out or you're chatting with somebody who's just starting out, we like think a lot about your superpower and how you can use that for good.

162
00:32:28,903 --> 00:32:29,603
That's good.

163
00:32:30,503 --> 00:32:34,403
Yeah, so we got a note here from makinen.

164
00:32:34,403 --> 00:32:42,003
We also love seeing the trend of new startups, and companies, building an impact from day, one really baking this into their model.

165
00:32:42,603 --> 00:32:50,403
I think that's also key and, you know, talking about you and I were talking about this in the Green Room a little bit ago, right before the event.

166
00:32:51,003 --> 00:33:10,203
But as far as looking at the employee journey in total, obviously we know the first 30, 60 90 days of really He for any new hire to fully get integrated with the culture and it would make sense to introduce the social impact causes and how to participate all that in those days.

167
00:33:10,203 --> 00:33:14,703
But where would you advise to get employees?

168
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:18,403
Really involved of corporate responsibility.

169
00:33:18,903 --> 00:33:19,703
Such a good question.

170
00:33:19,703 --> 00:33:22,103
So I would say there're two places.

171
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:34,603
I mean one, I have seen people do it in the interview process like, you know, you can just add, depending on maybe It's like a man manager question or even like appear interview which I think folks usually do that.

172
00:33:34,603 --> 00:33:35,003
It's something.

173
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:39,103
Just like what's your favorite cause like is there any nonprofits that you're working with?

174
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:44,903
Like we particularly focus on education like is that something that you care about?

175
00:33:44,903 --> 00:34:05,603
Like you can truly bake it in and that way if nothing else just so that the folks know that's something that you really, really care about but that, in terms of like when they're actually hired on, we have seen a lot of our companies, they Have like a slide about deed a slide about the IMPACT program, a slide about the policies during the onboarding process.

176
00:34:05,603 --> 00:34:15,003
So you know all companies do it a little bit differently but most companies do have an onboarding process, and they just have that as part of it and you introduce everything.

177
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:20,503
Some folks you know have like a seminar for all new hires that week or that month.

178
00:34:20,703 --> 00:34:26,003
And so we have seen people like do those presentations then and then I really loved it too.

179
00:34:26,503 --> 00:34:37,003
I did we call it new higher credit but It could look different and every client or company, but they give new hires $25 to spend on Deed from.

180
00:34:37,003 --> 00:34:37,803
That's cool.

181
00:34:38,103 --> 00:34:38,603
Yeah.

182
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:43,003
And so that's awesome because it also was like here's the platform we use.

183
00:34:43,003 --> 00:34:44,103
Here's what we care about.

184
00:34:44,103 --> 00:34:45,103
Here's our policies.

185
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:47,303
This is what it looks like and now go use it.

186
00:34:47,303 --> 00:34:51,303
And so then it allows the personal log on to deed spend that credit they know.

187
00:34:51,303 --> 00:34:58,503
The company is truly investing in that, and then they get to send some money to their favorite nonprofit.

188
00:34:58,503 --> 00:35:01,003
So, It's definitely a win-win that's good.

189
00:35:01,003 --> 00:35:09,603
So I am even as early as the interview process, you're introducing the company's involvement and then especially that onboarding process.

190
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:17,803
What about for employees that have been with the company for one year plus, how do you get them engaged?

191
00:35:18,103 --> 00:35:26,103
Yeah, really, really good question but I think that is really one like the bottoms-up approach is super important.

192
00:35:26,803 --> 00:35:28,303
I mean, and that's kind of buzzword.

193
00:35:28,303 --> 00:35:30,203
I feel like it Point, but I have seen lots of folks.

194
00:35:30,203 --> 00:35:38,103
Do like listening tours, where they go around and say, hey what have you really enjoyed that we have done with social impact, could be pre or post pandemic?

195
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,803
Like what do you feel like is missing?

196
00:35:39,903 --> 00:35:40,303
Are there?

197
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:44,103
Some nonprofit say you'd love to nominate how our different things working.

198
00:35:44,103 --> 00:35:51,503
So I think just like making people feel like their part of the process in the decision-making and then also just like identifying communities.

199
00:35:51,503 --> 00:35:53,903
That would be really excited to participate.

200
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:58,003
So we often times see, ER, G's employee resources resource groups.

201
00:35:58,003 --> 00:36:09,403
It's sometimes called A little bit different at different companies, but those groups often times really focus in on specific causes like speaking as a woman I can say like women at deed.

202
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:18,003
That's like a group that we would probably focus on supporting women-led nonprofits or nonprofits supporting women in different communities.

203
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:23,803
And so you can really lean into kind of those like cause specific organizations.

204
00:36:24,703 --> 00:36:56,103
We have seen lots of different things, you know, depending on how dispersed your Is having like, Regional ambassadors, who were super pumped about giving back and, like, the culture of giving at your company and so having, you know, almost like satellite or like remote groups that are specified for giving or talk about giving her to help like lead, local activations is also, I think a great way for folks who might have been involved for a while and maybe like haven't done anything during the pandemic or like looking to get more involved.

205
00:36:57,203 --> 00:36:58,703
But yeah, lots of like different.

206
00:36:58,803 --> 00:36:59,403
Fun ideas.

207
00:36:59,403 --> 00:37:01,803
I am sure some of those will come up more later too.

208
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,703
That's great.

209
00:37:03,903 --> 00:37:07,803
And if anybody has questions, feel free to drop them in Q&A.

210
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:11,103
And we will I am we're looking at that as well.

211
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:30,503
So, one of the things, Olivia, you mentioned was leadership and you'd say the top down the bottom up approach, But ultimately, we all know that it needs to start from the top and so that executive buy-in, like how can you speak to a little bit about what?

212
00:37:30,503 --> 00:37:32,003
You know what you have seen?

213
00:37:32,903 --> 00:37:36,803
With leaders that are involved leadership, that's not involved.

214
00:37:37,203 --> 00:37:48,203
What if there's a company out there right now where the leaders may not be fully involved in aware and there's an employee that wants to get the leadership more involved.

215
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:49,703
So there're different scenarios here.

216
00:37:49,703 --> 00:37:50,803
But can you speak to that?

217
00:37:50,803 --> 00:37:53,703
Significance of the leadership teams of all?

218
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:54,103
Yeah.

219
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:57,103
100%, it's such a, such a good point.

220
00:37:57,103 --> 00:38:14,903
And so, so important like I mean, Jenna, you mentioned, like, it just is not going to stick fully if It's if the leadership is not bought in and so that's why you know, we talked before like voice and choice which is more Bottoms Up and grassroot but it is really important for the leadership to really be bought in on the call causes that.

221
00:38:14,903 --> 00:38:22,903
The company is supporting and so yeah I can't like underscore that enough, that it's really important for the leaders to be bought in.

222
00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:32,003
I think that more and more like it very many does seem to be the rhetoric and you know like ESG has become much more kind of like top of mine.

223
00:38:32,003 --> 00:38:41,703
And, so I think that folks really are moving in that direction and it and hopefully, it won't be super difficult to convince any leaders who aren't yet bought in.

224
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:47,703
But I have just seen really effective uses of leadership bodden.

225
00:38:47,703 --> 00:39:06,603
So, you know you have all hands maybe once a week once a month and to have the leaders talking about the programming and the causes and the nonprofits and the impact during those team meetings is really, really an Active and it certainly shows how much they care and are bada in.

226
00:39:08,303 --> 00:39:20,303
I have also seen like really cool things where they will like, send an email and say I am going to this opportunity or like I will be attending this virtual opportunity and I would love for you to join of kind of this, like, Collective impact.

227
00:39:20,303 --> 00:39:31,203
And it also gives you face time to spend with an executive which can never hurt and so stuff like that, you know, and even, it's not just like the top executive.

228
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:42,703
It's also like managers and So then with like your team meetings to have it is again baked in as like an agenda point to say you know these this is our policy reminder to use your vtl like stuff.

229
00:39:42,703 --> 00:39:44,203
Like that is really important.

230
00:39:46,203 --> 00:39:58,603
And then I think that last part of the question I am just like if they're not yet bought in like reach out to our team, we have so many business use cases of like why it's really important to invest here?

231
00:39:58,903 --> 00:40:10,403
I think obviously like the big ones that a lot of people care about is Like the retention and the Recruitment, and the Fulfillment statistics, but there's even more than that.

232
00:40:10,403 --> 00:40:12,903
So they're certainly like lots of stuff.

233
00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:25,903
We can hopefully arm you with, to convince anybody who's not, but in yet, Laura just mentioned that they have done volunteer with me events with execs that have gone over pretty well.

234
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:45,403
That's an interesting idea to do events and have them have the executives, probably Express their passion, and belief around a certain cause I think that over communication is really key from the leadership perspective, totally.

235
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:48,903
And I think it like it reminds me some Early to PTO.

236
00:40:48,903 --> 00:40:56,703
Like I think it's really means a lot when an executive says, Hey I am going on PTO and I here's my out of office.

237
00:40:56,703 --> 00:41:02,103
I am not going to be reached and it really like sets the example of how important that is and that you want to feel refresh.

238
00:41:02,103 --> 00:41:10,703
And it's the same thing for volunteering is like, hey, I am going to take two hours this afternoon, and I am going to be here and here's like a photo of me doing it.

239
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:15,503
And I am a proponent of all of our employees doing this so it's really just like leading, by example.

240
00:41:16,503 --> 00:41:17,103
That's good.

241
00:41:17,903 --> 00:41:28,003
I would think that storytelling is also a key vehicle to support engagement of employees.

242
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:34,403
This isn't something we talked about as a question, but I am curious Olivia from your perspective.

243
00:41:34,503 --> 00:41:41,103
Any input on companies, you have seen that do storytelling really well around their social impact.

244
00:41:41,603 --> 00:41:43,303
That's such a good question.

245
00:41:44,103 --> 00:41:49,303
And yes, I mean I and I think Knowing like very specific stories.

246
00:41:49,303 --> 00:42:03,403
And I think this Loops all the way back to the very beginning of what we're talking about with intentionality and potentially, like, Drilling in on one or two causes that you as a company like, it feels very authentic that you would support this particular cause or this particular nonprofit or group of nonprofits.

247
00:42:03,803 --> 00:42:16,003
Then I think you become so much more familiar and you have like these actual stories of nonprofits and volunteers and donors that have been working together over weeks.

248
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:20,303
Sir years like that might have had a really incredible experience.

249
00:42:20,303 --> 00:42:27,303
One afternoon with a team or with an executive like you can create more of those like deeper relationships.

250
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:32,903
So I think that's like another reason to kind of dig in a little bit on some of these causes.

251
00:42:33,803 --> 00:42:43,703
But it also reminds me of something we have talked about, which is just how important it is for social impact teams to work, so closely with other teams.

252
00:42:43,703 --> 00:42:56,103
So, like a comms team is a Perfect example is like you want to be super abreast of what comms is working on and what and you want them to know exactly what you're working on.

253
00:42:56,103 --> 00:43:07,203
Because like you mentioned, like both internally and externally it's so important how you talk about this and how you really like make people feel included and excited and that impact is happening.

254
00:43:08,603 --> 00:43:13,103
And so the more you can share like those individual Stories, the kind of like Collective impact stories.

255
00:43:13,103 --> 00:43:18,503
We just had an amazing partner who they're like, Around sustainability and climate change.

256
00:43:18,503 --> 00:43:30,503
And they had this really cool like walk challenge that we were a part of to and so that was just like it wasn't even like direct volunteering but definitely falls under the impact bucket.

257
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:31,803
And it was super cool.

258
00:43:31,803 --> 00:43:33,103
Like how they kept all of us.

259
00:43:33,103 --> 00:43:36,203
Abreast of like, how many steps did we have?

260
00:43:36,203 --> 00:43:38,703
We met how many trees then have been planted?

261
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:40,603
Like how many steps do we have to go?

262
00:43:41,303 --> 00:43:45,903
And so definitely, like working super close to with your comms and marketing team on.

263
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:51,903
How to message that and kind of like, spread the good that y'all are doing, That's great.

264
00:43:52,303 --> 00:43:53,303
Thanks, thanks Olivia.

265
00:43:53,303 --> 00:43:57,303
I know you got some questions that I am seeing pop up in the Q&A.

266
00:43:57,503 --> 00:44:04,703
Before we transition to Q&A, I have one last question here, you know, companies even more.

267
00:44:04,703 --> 00:44:11,403
So, today are being urged to share, not only what they stand for, but what they stand up for.

268
00:44:12,203 --> 00:44:15,103
So that's in this case of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

269
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,403
A company social impact strategy.

270
00:44:17,403 --> 00:44:21,103
Also, needs to be part of that core Strategy.

271
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:28,403
But how can companies do this respectfully and authentically with all the other things going on?

272
00:44:28,903 --> 00:44:30,003
What do you advise?

273
00:44:30,203 --> 00:44:32,903
Yeah, yeah it's really hard.

274
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:37,303
Let us just say that first and definitely something that like every single company is thinking about.

275
00:44:37,303 --> 00:44:48,203
And I feel like even in the past year, there's been like many, many things that I am sure companies who is a kind of struggled with how to talk about and support or not support.

276
00:44:48,703 --> 00:44:50,503
Another really good reason why you need to work.

277
00:44:50,603 --> 00:45:01,603
Super closely with comms super closely with the people team, the HR team, and then obviously have execs interested in part of the conversation because those are likely the people that are kind of stakeholders there.

278
00:45:01,803 --> 00:45:20,503
But I think, when we talk to our partners, about trying to figure out, like, where or how to come out on certain issues or questions, it's more like just what feels the most authentic to you as a company and that can sometimes be kind of hard to get at, but a lot of our clients that we have worked with that, like do it in the best.

279
00:45:20,703 --> 00:45:30,003
Way it's a lot about communicating correctly, but then also like, leaving that space for folks who might not agree in the exact same way.

280
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:31,903
So either be heard or to feel supported.

281
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:37,803
So we have given this example a couple times but it's like you know the 1X matching to whatever nonprofits.

282
00:45:37,803 --> 00:45:56,403
They choose within you know a certain we have a lot of folks who like won't do political or religious, obviously like hate groups are always blocked but that you do allow people to give somewhere that they would Like voice and choice, but then you're like doubling down on donations towards organizations that you really care about.

283
00:45:58,603 --> 00:46:10,703
So that's one thing and then I think we mentioned this too, but like being really clear like what are the Evergreen causes that you care about and like those things likely won't really change.

284
00:46:10,703 --> 00:46:28,003
But then building in the place to be more, reactive to disaster relief or different things that happen because then I think, We tend to communicate that like this is our policy like we designate 80% of our resources towards these certain things.

285
00:46:28,003 --> 00:46:33,303
We know are going to happen and then the rest is like for things that might pop up.

286
00:46:33,303 --> 00:46:37,903
And so we have seen that to be really effective because then employees just like understand what's going on.

287
00:46:37,903 --> 00:46:45,203
Like they're like you know, they can't respond to everything because you only have 20% of resources allocated to disaster relief, or whatever it might be.

288
00:46:45,203 --> 00:46:50,403
So just being like very upfront and then the companies know the best.

289
00:46:50,603 --> 00:46:56,003
Like what is your company culture and community and like what's going to resonate the most with them?

290
00:46:56,503 --> 00:46:58,303
So again just like a big plug to work.

291
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:06,603
So closely with the comms team, the marketing team, the people team to make sure that you're communicating it in the right way.

292
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:09,003
That's so good.

293
00:47:09,003 --> 00:47:17,603
I love the clarity of the percentage breakdowns and being really clear with your employees.

294
00:47:17,903 --> 00:47:22,603
This is, you know where we're, we're participating and how you can participate.

295
00:47:22,603 --> 00:47:25,303
I think that Clarity is really helpful.

296
00:47:25,703 --> 00:47:26,103
Yeah.

297
00:47:26,203 --> 00:47:27,003
I totally agree.

298
00:47:27,003 --> 00:47:33,103
And we see that we have an amazing support team and I feel like they really lean into that.

299
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:45,603
Like, you know, just simply saying like this is the That our platform is working on, like if you have questions or like working by, if you have questions on that like we're happy to talk you through it.

300
00:47:45,603 --> 00:47:47,303
But like here's all the information.

301
00:47:47,703 --> 00:47:54,203
And usually I mean, people usually are very reasonable, and they're like oh I understand because this is the policy that's been set up.

302
00:47:54,203 --> 00:48:07,003
I think we're where they're sometimes confusion like is when there's ambiguity, but it's really, you know, I get it because these are really like difficult conversations and decisions to make, but I think like as clear as you.

303
00:48:07,103 --> 00:48:19,103
Can be unlike your plan and your policies, and your process, the more that employees are like, oh yeah, I get that like that's reasonable, that's good and Ingrid just mention, it's easier to say no, as well, the clear you are.

304
00:48:19,203 --> 00:48:39,003
So it gets me thinking, you know, it's really key to have an owner that's really driving this initiative and driving the cross-departmental alignment and communication all that With the customers that you work with, what, what are you seeing as that common stakeholder owner?

305
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:42,503
Like, what is their title, who generally owns it?

306
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,503
Where do they sit in organization?

307
00:48:44,903 --> 00:48:48,803
Yes, that's such a good question and it does it vary for sure.

308
00:48:48,903 --> 00:49:01,703
So, I would say, like, the most common title we see is like head of social impact director of social impact, depending on how big the company is and how much they have invested in social impact.

309
00:49:02,103 --> 00:49:02,703
They will often times.

310
00:49:02,803 --> 00:49:22,603
Like potentially a couple folks part of that team like somebody that might be focused more on volunteering, someone that might be focused on disaster relief, for example, or donations like somebody who's more on the policy side of things like, making sure the volunteer time off policy is set and write and like the donations policy.

311
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,703
So, like different people format in different ways.

312
00:49:26,703 --> 00:49:32,703
Sometimes there's like an engagement specialist that job is so fun and like gets to come up with different ideas on.

313
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:40,103
Unlike how to engage folks, in that company's impact and then it also sits in different places.

314
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:45,703
I have seen it likes it, I think the most common and to me makes the most sense is under people team.

315
00:49:45,703 --> 00:49:52,103
So like HR people just because it really is like such a benefit to the employee into the company.

316
00:49:52,603 --> 00:49:55,003
So that's probably where I have seen it the most.

317
00:49:55,003 --> 00:50:04,803
But I have also seen it fall like under like policy teams and comms teams just because like, depending again on the type The financial institutions is a good one.

318
00:50:04,803 --> 00:50:10,703
Like they have to do so much reporting that it might make sense for that to be like under more of a policy or a comms umbrella.

319
00:50:12,703 --> 00:50:14,403
That's helpful, great.

320
00:50:14,503 --> 00:50:17,003
All right, let us transition into some of this Q&A.

321
00:50:17,503 --> 00:50:19,303
We have got a question here.

322
00:50:19,403 --> 00:50:21,403
Jessica is our producer in the green room.

323
00:50:21,403 --> 00:50:26,903
Thank you so much for pressing, the keys here, because you bring the question to the stage.

324
00:50:27,603 --> 00:50:32,703
How, and when do you introduce these communities and keep them relevant as employees settle in?

325
00:50:32,703 --> 00:50:36,903
So, you touch this a little bit earlier Olivia, what are your thoughts?

326
00:50:37,603 --> 00:50:37,903
Yes.

327
00:50:37,903 --> 00:50:38,803
Really good question.

328
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:53,703
So when I think of this question and happy to go in a different direction but I think of like employee resource groups or potentially like Regional Ambassador groups, and so we can start talking about ER, G's and can take it in whatever direction is most helpful.

329
00:50:54,803 --> 00:51:04,603
But again, this kind of seems like a theme so important to wear it with the people team in the HR team because they're often times the one's kind of standing up the ERG groups.

330
00:51:05,603 --> 00:51:14,203
But as we also mentioned earlier like the earlier you can incorporate impact into ER GS the better because then it kind of becomes part of their ethos.

331
00:51:14,603 --> 00:51:20,103
We have worked with some companies that the ERG is and actually on deed we have like special ERG pages.

332
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:35,303
And on that page, you put like your logo and a lot of companies have like super funny or do you logos and then also a description and so some people will have like mission statements for their ERG, and they will build impact into that.

333
00:51:35,403 --> 00:51:36,403
Mission statement.

334
00:51:36,403 --> 00:51:56,203
And, so I love that because it automatically creates a space where that is something that's like intended to be something that they think about and do and talk about that would be like, my biggest advice would be like early and often like try to bake it into the mission statement if you can.

335
00:51:57,203 --> 00:52:02,003
And then second part I am just making sure I answered all the parts of it.

336
00:52:04,203 --> 00:52:06,603
It might be in the answered part 02.

337
00:52:06,603 --> 00:52:07,603
Keep them relevant.

338
00:52:07,703 --> 00:52:12,603
So then I think the relevancy part is kind of again going back to like the listening tour in the surveys.

339
00:52:12,603 --> 00:52:20,903
Like once that your G is going and has they're like impact part of the mission statement and is like rocking and rolling.

340
00:52:21,503 --> 00:52:26,503
Usually they don't need to like too much driving behind them.

341
00:52:26,503 --> 00:52:33,303
Because, like I said, it's like people who really identify with that, cause with those nonprofits, and they can kind of like, do it themselves.

342
00:52:33,503 --> 00:52:47,903
Elves, but if it's not moving so much like kind of finding out why like, hey we have given you the resources, you have a budget of, you know, 25,000 dollars to go matching, how you want, you know, you have the time you have the VTO policies.

343
00:52:47,903 --> 00:52:49,503
Like what, how, what's missing?

344
00:52:49,503 --> 00:52:53,003
How can we support you to drive that impact within your ear G?

345
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:59,203
So hopefully that's a little bit helpful in terms of how args work I have .

346
00:52:59,203 --> 00:53:03,403
Like seen people use them to do really cool.

347
00:53:03,503 --> 00:53:03,903
Stuff.

348
00:53:03,903 --> 00:53:12,203
And even do like full presentations again at all hands, that specifically about the impact that the ERG made in communities.

349
00:53:12,603 --> 00:53:30,103
And so, that's like a way to kind of bring everything together that we have talked about of, like, highlighting the work that the ERG is doing, specifically focused on impact in there, cause area, which is just really cool and I think pretty inspiring for other people to be like, oh, I want to do that with my ear G with like the nonprofit's that we care about.

350
00:53:31,303 --> 00:53:32,103
So good.

351
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:34,603
Are we have another question here?

352
00:53:36,103 --> 00:53:45,903
What advice do you have for rapidly growing organizations trying to structure their current charitable giving programs and who are key stakeholders to get in the room?

353
00:53:47,203 --> 00:53:59,903
Awesome, I think we're just pulling now from other conversations we have had but I, you can pull from kind of that super power structure of like, you know, feeling like a little bit intimidated of not knowing where to start.

354
00:54:00,603 --> 00:54:05,703
But as I think MacKinnon mentioned like early and often like get it super built in.

355
00:54:06,003 --> 00:54:17,003
To your company's ethos and the employees and as you're hiring, and then think about like what is the thing that we want to change or help solve, you know, what is our super power?

356
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:19,203
And then how are we going to actually tangibly?

357
00:54:19,203 --> 00:54:19,903
Do it?

358
00:54:20,803 --> 00:54:25,403
And then, in terms of stakeholders are moving, talked about this a lot too, but exacts leadership.

359
00:54:25,403 --> 00:54:35,703
So, so important to have them on board, the like comms team marketing, team people in HR team and then I would say like those, ER, G's for sure.

360
00:54:35,803 --> 00:54:41,003
Sure and usually ERG is had like a leader or some type of like boards that you could work with.

361
00:54:41,303 --> 00:54:54,003
I mentioned these like Regional ambassadors, but we do have some companies who are super Global, and so they need to make sure that a lot of there they will have like a big employee population in India and so that's going to be like a very different kind of giving culture.

362
00:54:54,203 --> 00:55:03,803
Then we might see in the US or the UK and so that Regional Ambassador is so helpful to be able to say to like help set up local opportunities.

363
00:55:03,803 --> 00:55:13,203
But also communicate back and say like This is what we need as like, a team in India, that might be different from what the team is doing and Australia, or the UK or the US.

364
00:55:13,703 --> 00:55:17,903
Wow, that's another layer to factor in is the regionality?

365
00:55:18,203 --> 00:55:19,603
That's, that's huge.

366
00:55:19,603 --> 00:55:24,203
And, and identifying the local communities to be part of per region across the globe.

367
00:55:24,203 --> 00:55:25,003
That's good.

368
00:55:25,803 --> 00:55:26,203
All right.

369
00:55:26,203 --> 00:55:28,603
We have got our third question here.

370
00:55:30,003 --> 00:55:34,803
What advice do you have on wedding organizations to partner with?

371
00:55:34,903 --> 00:55:41,903
We want to make sure we align with their values and Mission as well, but this can be hard to find without conversation.

372
00:55:42,903 --> 00:55:48,303
Good, classic and question and something we work on with our clients all the time.

373
00:55:48,903 --> 00:55:50,703
I will personally give a little plug.

374
00:55:50,703 --> 00:55:55,403
So at deed, we have a non-profit, success team, and so they work very closely.

375
00:55:55,403 --> 00:55:56,703
We have a partner success team.

376
00:55:56,703 --> 00:55:59,603
That works, that is like our clients point of contact.

377
00:55:59,703 --> 00:56:04,303
Then our team is also working directly with the nonprofit success team.

378
00:56:04,503 --> 00:56:13,103
And these are folks that have worked at nonprofits worked at wedding organizations and like really, really understand the landscape and what you're looking for there.

379
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:19,503
So with our clients, that is an easier question to answer because they get to work directly with our nonprofit success team.

380
00:56:19,703 --> 00:56:23,003
And that team helps them like give recommendations.

381
00:56:23,003 --> 00:56:24,403
They have already done a lot of the vetting.

382
00:56:24,403 --> 00:56:26,403
They might be able to connect them if they can.

383
00:56:28,003 --> 00:56:37,703
But if you're kind of doing it on your own, I think there's like a lot of different things that you can do especially now in the wonderful age of the internet.

384
00:56:37,803 --> 00:56:51,803
I mean, obviously there's like the Baseline which is like checking on guidestar and network for good and places to make sure they're like in good standing with the IRS that's like Baseline and there's other equivalents in other places.

385
00:56:52,503 --> 00:56:55,703
But then we do like a lot of research on social media.

386
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:59,603
Like a lot of times now, nonprofits have Facebook, they have Instagram.

387
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:02,203
Like are they active, are they doing things?

388
00:57:02,203 --> 00:57:03,803
Like, are they being transparent?

389
00:57:03,803 --> 00:57:06,103
Are they putting out different statements on things?

390
00:57:06,603 --> 00:57:20,303
You can like glean, a decent amount of information there and then a lot of times, you know, nonprofits need and want our help especially companies just because they know that it is, the collective impact piece.

391
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:25,503
So I would definitely not hesitate in reaching out and just asking to have a conversation with them.

392
00:57:26,303 --> 00:57:27,103
It would be like, good debt.

393
00:57:27,103 --> 00:57:29,703
Probably have a couple questions that you asked all nonprofits.

394
00:57:29,803 --> 00:57:34,403
Just so you have like an across the board questions that you ask for folks.

395
00:57:35,603 --> 00:57:45,203
But yeah, those I think would be my recommendations is like, you know, check the, the validated sources that you already have access to like, look at their present you again.

396
00:57:45,203 --> 00:57:47,103
He said, Network for good.

397
00:57:47,203 --> 00:57:49,503
Now we're forgetting guidestar ones that we use a lot.

398
00:57:49,503 --> 00:57:51,703
But yeah, those are just places that you can like type in there.

399
00:57:51,703 --> 00:57:57,603
Ein, get some information, some financial information, so that's like a good place to start.

400
00:57:57,703 --> 00:58:07,803
Look at their social media, look at their website, like some nonprofits haven't updated their website in a really, really long time, which could because of lack of resources, which is even more, so why you should help them.

401
00:58:08,803 --> 00:58:14,403
But, you know, that could be something that you want to look into or ask about like maybe their defunct or not doing that much.

402
00:58:15,103 --> 00:58:29,403
And then the last one would just be, you know try to get on the phone with them or at the very least like send some questions over email because they want our support, and so they should be super open and transparent about what they're up to and what the funds go to.

403
00:58:30,403 --> 00:58:40,203
Our team just as like an incredible job and looking like, at what percentage of funds are going, we're like how much are they paying their stuff based on the donations that come in?

404
00:58:40,203 --> 00:58:51,803
So, lots of different things that you can look at, but our nonprofit success seemed, like I said, I will give them a little plug, they are just incredible, and they do a lot of this for our clients and with our clients and partnership.

405
00:58:53,703 --> 00:58:54,603
That's awesome.

406
00:58:55,303 --> 00:58:56,003
Wow.

407
00:58:56,003 --> 00:59:20,003
So many golden insights Olivia that you dropped for us during this time and it looks like we have wrapped all the questions if anyone has a last-minute question, feel free to drop that in, but other than that, Olivia, would you have any parting words of advice or anything for our guest today?

408
00:59:21,303 --> 00:59:23,303
Yes, I think.

409
00:59:24,303 --> 00:59:36,703
I think the biggest one which we already talked about is just making sure that you are building in that space to be reactive because, you know, it's a crazy world that we live in and so many different things are moving and changing.

410
00:59:36,703 --> 00:59:39,303
And so, it's really important to have those core pillars of.

411
00:59:39,303 --> 00:59:41,503
Like, this is what we care about in, this is what we stand for.

412
00:59:41,803 --> 00:59:51,103
But then also, knowing that so many things are moving and changing that, you want to have that elasticity to be able to react to it because that's going to be really important to your employees.

413
00:59:51,103 --> 00:59:52,003
So that's one thing.

414
00:59:52,103 --> 01:00:01,103
And then the other thing I think Ink which hopefully we mention and gave some examples of but like engagement Employee Engagement, especially around giving should be fun.

415
01:00:01,203 --> 01:00:06,103
Like there's so many fun things that you can do like, employee resource groups.

416
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:10,803
Have done the coolest things and it's stuff that like, they really, really, really care about.

417
01:00:11,203 --> 01:00:14,203
I think my favorite thing and it doesn't have to be employee resource groups.

418
01:00:14,203 --> 01:00:19,003
It could be like companies, and they got an insane percentage of Engagement.

419
01:00:19,003 --> 01:00:26,703
Like I want to say higher than 80% of Engagement was like a I think Challenge and you could do it with exact switch.

420
01:00:26,703 --> 01:00:36,703
I have seen done where like, you know, six execs record themselves singing to a different song and then that is paired with, like, they're nonprofit of choice.

421
01:00:36,703 --> 01:00:40,703
And so, you play it during an all hands or like a happy hour.

422
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:45,803
And then to vote for that video, or for that, exact, and that nonprofit, you donate to them.

423
01:00:45,903 --> 01:00:52,403
And so then you can see, you know, you have those six nonprofits and whoever whatever nonprofit raises, the most money, like that exact one.

424
01:00:52,603 --> 01:01:02,703
And so, you could do that Also, by teams like I have seen that like, the marketing team versus the Eng team first, the Congo cetera, and so they will do like a group link saying core lip sync or like do it.

425
01:01:03,603 --> 01:01:09,203
I have also seen the same thing done with a pet fashion show, so, you know, daily were part of that.

426
01:01:09,303 --> 01:01:16,703
So you can make it really fun, and then they're like supporting a Humane Society or something like that, so you can make it really fun.

427
01:01:17,303 --> 01:01:19,403
And I have seen that be really effective.

428
01:01:19,403 --> 01:01:23,303
In terms of just employees, getting excited and feeling motivated and connected.

429
01:01:23,503 --> 01:01:26,203
Their companies but also to their colleagues.

430
01:01:27,603 --> 01:01:30,003

432
01:01:32,003 --> 01:01:37,003
I think each of us are going to take something away from this and be able to apply it very quickly.
