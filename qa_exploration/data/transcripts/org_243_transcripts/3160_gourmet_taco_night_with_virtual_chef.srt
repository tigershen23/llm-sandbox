1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Put it in all caps so that I hear it better.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,000
That's that doesn't make any sense.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,600
Anyways, that's what we're going to do.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,600
We're going to use the chat for any questions.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,400
If I need to slow down, please let me know.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,700
I am going to go ahead and try to like, slow it down.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,300
Come back checking on everyone and give everyone a break to make sure we're all caught up.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,100
I do want to go ahead and let you all check in with each other.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,200
A little bit of connection.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,100
Just a moment.

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,400
We're going to see that pop up.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,200
That Linda was telling us about appear on your screen.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,900
Inviting you to the breakout room.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Just hit except and I will see you back here in about seven minutes for the plant-based kit.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,500
Remember before you go on that.

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Breakout Ro room.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,400
Turn your oven up to 400°.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,300
Now do that now so that way we're not playing catch-up.

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,600
All right, get your plates ready.

20
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,800
Get your knives ready.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,200
Sharpen those knives up.

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,000
We're not going in the microwave tonight.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're going on the stove or using fire.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, okay.

25
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:52,400
Owner of Olden, Food, Forest a sustainable Farm in Rogers, Texas, we grow primarily Greens on here, 2016 started, Urban farming in South Austin, and I wanted to have more land because gardening was a hobby that got out of control.

26
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,000
So we practice permaculture principles out here.

27
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:06,200
The way you can Define permaculture is that it is a way to design an ecosystem that is beneficial to Plants soil, and humans.

28
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,200
One of our primary missions is to lead the land in better shape than when we found it.

29
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,700
A lot of farms don't practice that we have these tunnels.

30
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,000
We have Hundred-Foot tunnels.

31
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,500
We have 5 mm on our farm right now, and they are great.

32
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,100
Protectors from extreme weather star Greenhouse.

33
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,000
And then we transplant by hand, all of these letters, heads that we have grown in our Greenhouse from seed.

34
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,500
So, everything we grow here, we have grown ourselves.

35
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,100
I love, love, love growing lettuce.

36
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:49,900
Well, you'd be enjoying at your event or lettuce is from this bed and most likely this bed for the folks who are going to be part of this event.

37
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,000
I think you're going to really like this lettuce.

38
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,200
One of the things that I really love about Austin is how food-centric it is.

39
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,800
So many great restaurants in Austin by local farms.

40
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,900
There's a really nice healthy diversity of farms.

41
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:16,700
And that wouldn't exist if restaurants and school districts, grocery stores, weren't supporting those local farms.

42
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,300
The more you keep your money local, the more you're growing the economy and the more you're Growing the future health of your own community.

43
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,400
And that's, it's great to see Austin.

44
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,300
Not only talk that talk, don't really walk that walk.

45
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,100
Awesome, and that's Austin or whatever Community you're in.

46
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:53,200
We have truly believed to support your local food community and to keep the food economy, booming that you must put your dollars back into that and enjoy the freshest, most delicious foods because I guarantee you wherever you are.

47
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,100
I saw some cities, you're in San Diego.

48
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,400
Has one of the best farmers markets in the world.

49
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,900
You're going to find these great products and it really great that we can bring this Central Texas.

50
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,100
Mostly Austin Centric, But Central Texas ingredients to you.

51
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,300
Now, you don't have salads out.

52
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,200
You don't have that lettuce.

53
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
That lettuce is out of season until early next year.

54
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:23,900
However, and that there's a small part of the video where the onions are sticking up and those onions, take about eight months to grow.

55
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,400
And we're actually using those sweet Texas onions today that were growing.

56
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,800
When that video was filmed pretty cool.

57
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,300
Alright, so at a certain point, too, Two or a few points this evening.

58
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,400
I am going to break away and say, okay plant-based kit standard kit.

59
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,400
This is one of those moments.

60
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,900
I want to be really clear about that.

61
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,500
Alrighty.

62
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,900
So here we go.

63
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Plant-based kit.

64
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,400
I had said earlier to go ahead and heat up your oven a little preheated 400 degrees.

65
00:10:52,700 --> 00:11:00,900
One thing I like to do just for cleanliness sake because I always like to kind of line my baking dishes casserole, pan, cookie pan with foil.

66
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,800
When I am cooking these Foods, you Savory Foods.

67
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,300
So that when I am done with this, I can use my agrees.

68
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,600
I can just pull that foil off, give it a quick rinse, and my pot is now clean.

69
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,700
I am going to go ahead and put this in the oven.

70
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,900
I have combined.

71
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,400
Both the sweet potato and the carrot.

72
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,300
But I have not put those mushrooms in there.

73
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,600
Again.

74
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,200
This is for the plant-based kit.

75
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:34,100
There's about 10 or 12 of you who have that kit, the carrots and the sweet potatoes are in the oven.

76
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
Your mushrooms are sitting next to your stove.

77
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,900
All right, you are taken care of for a minute.

78
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:47,300
I am now going to go over to the standard kit and talk about the proteins that we are going to cook in those pans that I told you earlier to have on the stove.

79
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,800
I have already heated them up.

80
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,900
Because I like to get a little bit of a jump start.

81
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,800
So go ahead and start heating your pans up at this point.

82
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,400
And for the plan base, we are also going to do a little sauteing.

83
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,900
So you two will have a saute pan for your mushrooms.

84
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,000
But let us get your pan heated up.

85
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,200
Now.

86
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,700
One thing I like to do is I like to take my three proteins back to the standard kit.

87
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,000
Now.

88
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,900
I am going to take my three proteins.

89
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,300
I have a chicken tinga.

90
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,100
I have a pork carnitas and then I have some carne asada made with this delicious pea, Loretta.

91
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,600
Strip steak.

92
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,200
So I have those three proteins.

93
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,100
I have taken my knife, and I am cutting this almost like a book.

94
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,800
So that I can open my compostable packaging up all the way.

95
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:43,600
I am going to use this packaging, not only as a tool, but when I am finished with it, I am going to put it in my compost, and I am going to use it to go back into the Earth.

96
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Okay, we're very proud of the fact that we have figure out a way to Source.

97
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
All compostable, packaging.

98
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,900
I am moving to the stovetop now.

99
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,800
All right, I have my chicken team.

100
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:02,400
You're going right into the pot for the little lid on it.

101
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,300
Would put this on low heat.

102
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,700
This is my Kamala talking about earlier, or my flat top or griddle top.

103
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,400
Sometimes it's called a Plancha.

104
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,400
I have this on a very low heat.

105
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,900
I am going to cook some tortillas here.

106
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,400
I am also going to heat up my chicken.

107
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Get I have chicken in there.

108
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
My sauce pots.

109
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:27,900
Now, I have started my cast iron and then for those who have the plant base, I have a saute pan here.

110
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,200
I am just going to put a little bit of fat and you have a package it says new.

111
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:40,700
True loyal in your kit, and we're going to put some of that neutral oil onto our heating up pans.

112
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,500
Well, hands aren't super hot yet because I just asked you to turn them on, but they're going to get there in a minute.

113
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,600
You're going to start to see some of this oil start to smoke.

114
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,600
That is good.

115
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,300
We're at that smoking point.

116
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,500
A little bit of white or gray smoke or light colored gray.

117
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,600
Smoke is great.

118
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,600
We're scared of black smoke, but we like gray smoke.

119
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,000
Okay.

120
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,100
First, I am going to eat see here, my carne asada.

121
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,400
Am I pants since I saw that smoke?

122
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,300
I know it's hot enough to do what I needed to do here.

123
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,500
All righty.

124
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:30,100
Now my other saute pan, I am just sort of waiting for that when that oil, when the viscosity of, it turns into more like a water texture, will know where they are.

125
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,100
All right.

126
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,600
After the sear on this.

127
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,100
I am going to use the same pan to heat up my carnitas.

128
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,400
So that's just going to go for a minute.

129
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,800
I have that at about a medium to medium-high heat.

130
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,700
Yes, you can.

131
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,800
It's a home packaging compostable it.

132
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,700
Is it takes a little longer, right?

133
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,200
I wouldn't like, lying here rose with it, but you can put it straight into your compost.

134
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,600
I am going to go ahead and open up my tortilla packaging because I like to get a little bit of air in those tortillas.

135
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,900
All right, I am starting to smell the aroma of that steak.

136
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,900
I am going to come back over here.

137
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,100
Let me grab my tongs.

138
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,800
Now remember, this steak is already fully cooked.

139
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,900
All we're doing is we're getting a sear on it.

140
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,800
For a little bit of texture and flavor, and we're heating it through.

141
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,700
I also see that my own oil now is this shimmering around the pan?

142
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:53,800
So I am going to put plant-based kit, my mushrooms in here and start to saute these Now, these are mushrooms with a mixture of aromatic.

143
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,700
Some of those delicious onions from Bolton Food, Forest and Wheeler coche.

144
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,500
Does anybody know what we look on chairs?

145
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,300
No, takers on the wheelchair.

146
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,900
Will it talk to an is a fungus that grows on the outside of corner?

147
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,600
So that is correct.

148
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:24,900
Chris.

149
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:32,200
It is a corn fungus and it is a delicacy in many parts of the world, especially in Mexico.

150
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,500
And some of the other Latin American countries.

151
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,600
All right, when we come back over here and give this a flip.

152
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,500
If you see, I have some nice caramelization on my steak.

153
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,900
When we go ahead and lower my heat down to medium-low.

154
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,100
Let that heat through.

155
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,600
I am also checking my mushrooms here.

156
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,700
Giving them saute with your cooking.

157
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,600
Those mushrooms are going to get also very aromatic or going to start to smell.

158
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,000
This is not a pepper in there.

159
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The garlic, the onion.

160
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,099
Now, there is a little bit of chili in there, some salt and pepper, but it's not too spicy.

161
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:05,700
I promise.

162
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,900
We're probably at about a two or three on a 1 to 10 scale.

163
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,300
Okay.

164
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,500
Now I am going to check my chicken.

165
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,800
Give it a little stir.

166
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,000
Make sure that's heating up.

167
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,500
I see some steam coming out of there.

168
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,599
So I know it's doing what it's supposed to do.

169
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,099
Again, that chicken is fully cooked.

170
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,900
So I know that all I have to do is get it warm.

171
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,700
All right.

172
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
I am going to go ahead and pull my Stakeout.

173
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,200
Looks.

174
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,700
I love good.

175
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,100
Caramelization on both sides.

176
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,400
I am gonna let that rest.

177
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,900
We nearly didn't need to cook it for long since fully cooked.

178
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,500
And now I am going to put my pork carnitas in that same pan.

179
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:58,200
There's already enough residual fat from the stake, plus the Carnitas themselves are cooked and a delicious aromatic flat.

180
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,000
So we don't, we don't need to add anymore.

181
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,800
It's going to do what it needs to do in this pan.

182
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,400
Give another saute on these.

183
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,000
Flip of the saute pan on these mushrooms.

184
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,000
Got my steak resting.

185
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,900
My Carnitas a pop in here.

186
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:24,500
I have my chicken tinga heating up, and if I am a plant-based, I have carrots and squash in the oven.

187
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,400
Now.

188
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,500
I am going to slow her down.

189
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,600
Let my Carnitas pop and cook.

190
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:34,600
I am gonna put my mushroom pan on very low, and I am going to check in and make sure everyone.

191
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,100
MK, would you not put the Carnitas in the pan?

192
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,900
The mushrooms were in because you should not have both.

193
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,300
Yes.

194
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,700
The one that steak was in.

195
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,200
So pull out that stage.

196
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Let it rest Carnitas go into that pan.

197
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:56,900
That is correct.

198
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,300
Rachel.

199
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,900
That is correct.

200
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,500
M'Kay.

201
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,600
You are good MK.

202
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,200
I am curious.

203
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,400
You have mushrooms in your kit.

204
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,100
Okay, good.

205
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,900
So that's why I would have been confused too.

206
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,500
Okay.

207
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,300
So the next thing I am going to do is I am going to start to grab my tortillas, and we have sent you a lot of tortillas.

208
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:26,500
This Taco kit makes 12 different tacos for of three different kinds of finding out how you want to build them.

209
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:36,500
Now, if you aren't going to eat 12 tacos tonight, what I would do, little Pro tip, the save about half of your tortillas and eat them maybe with breakfast.

210
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:46,100
Bones, some of you, especially the Texans may know what breakfast tacos are you, you few people in California.

211
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,700
There are a lot like breakfast burritos, but smaller the burritos aren't really a real thing.

212
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,600
So yeah, 12 Spencer.

213
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,900
I am eating 12 to, I am right there with you.

214
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,400
All right.

215
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,300
I am going back to my stovetop.

216
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
My Carnitas have been going for about 2 minutes.

217
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,300
I am going to give them a flip.

218
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,500
Look at that.

219
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,800
Have caramelization.

220
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,100
I have crispiness.

221
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,900
That is exactly what we want.

222
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,000
I am going to drop for tortillas on my flat top or my go Mal.

223
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,300
I am going to check my oven.

224
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,300
You know, I am going to turn my oven off because I know.

225
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,200
That my veggies are done and they look awesome.

226
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,300
I see some delicious.

227
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,600
I have a delicious Aroma.

228
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,300
There's some steam coming off of them, and I am now heating up tortillas.

229
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:51,400
Alright, the next thing I am going to do is I am going to lower my heat of my Carnitas to a very low.

230
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:59,300
Now, I have everything on low heat except for my tortilla and my chicken, which I have on a medium heat.

231
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,400
I have turned off my oven.

232
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,600
Okay, we have gotten through the hard part.

233
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,300
We have gotten through the cooking part.

234
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,400
Let me heat up a few more tortillas, and we're going to start doing the garnishes.

235
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,000
I am going to slow down, just slow it down just a bit.

236
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,800
See where everyone is.

237
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,000
There're any questions that need to be answered Eileen.

238
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,500
Look at that.

239
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,800
That looks amazing.

240
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:21,800
Breakfast.

241
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,500
Tacos on the bottom.

242
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,300
That is correct.

243
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,700
And okay.

244
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,600
Where do you live now?

245
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:35,100
Actually, if you have your sous chef working for you, smart, that's what we do to.

246
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,700
Wow.

247
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,800
You just went for it.

248
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,800
Andrew from Dallas, okay, in case oh, you know, you know about breakfast tacos.

249
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,200
Okay, I am going to bring my steak over got my chicken over.

250
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,600
I am flipping.

251
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,400
Tortillas that's going.

252
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,000
Well.

253
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I have got my veggies.

254
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,200
I have got my mushrooms, right?

255
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,600
We're on the same page.

256
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:10,500
I am going to go ahead, and we have my tortillas this first round of tortillas is hot, which is awesome.

257
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,100
I am gonna put them in my tortilla warmer.

258
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,400
Remember if you don't have a tortilla warmer and you just have some linen, that works very well.

259
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
What's happened is that linen?

260
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,400
The steaming of that is going to continue to cook the tortillas.

261
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,100
Alright.

262
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,400
Now, we're going to build our Taco plate.

263
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,700
Does anybody have any questions before we start going on this mise en place?

264
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes.

265
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,000
How do we save the tortillas?

266
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,300
Good question.

267
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:55,800
I would keep some of this parchment paper that we have between them and if we're just going to save him for a day or two just put them into like a nice pork side, zip lock bag and kind of just try to get most of the air out of there.

268
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,200
The less air or oxygen in the packaging, the better.

269
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,600
If you don't have a Ziploc bag that these will fit in, it's best to keep them flat.

270
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,700
Just use some plastic wrap and wrap them very tightly, then put them in the refrigerator.

271
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,300
You want to save them in the refrigerator.

272
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,700
All right.

273
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,800
So before this meat or veggies get cold.

274
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,700
I want to start building out my taco plate.

275
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,100
First things first.

276
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:24,600
We have this oaxacan Cassio, this cheese that is made for us, in Oaxaca by a family that's been making the cheese for generations.

277
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,700
And you may see a hawk and queso in the grocery store and the markets.

278
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,200
But I guarantee you, when I can say this with complete certainty, none of it tastes like this.

279
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Mrs. The most delicious.

280
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:47,000
Well, how can Castle you Had I promise next, I am going to open up our chili Diablo, which is a grilled.

281
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,700
Jalapeño.

282
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,800
I am going to leave mine.

283
00:23:51,400 --> 00:24:03,000
Well, you may leave your toll because I like to do is take a bite of my taco and then take a bite of my pepper, but you can also cut it into an aha, which is the shape of roasted peppers like this.

284
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,400
When you come this way, put that right in the middle.

285
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,000
Next.

286
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,500
I am gonna open up my schnee pack which are these pickled onions.

287
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,600
These are pickled, the red onions that are pickled with habanero.

288
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,600
So there's a little more heat to this element.

289
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,100
There's some fresh garlic and Mexican oregano in there.

290
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,100
These are delicious.

291
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,700
Addition.

292
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,800
Next, I am going to open up my avocado.

293
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,900
Texans.

294
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,100
The avocados and Texas are out of season.

295
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
So these are California, avocados.

296
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,700
Thank you, California.

297
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,600
I don't know what you would do with avocado without avocados.

298
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,100
I don't know what I would do without our kados.

299
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,800
You're welcome.

300
00:24:50,600 --> 00:25:00,900
All right, I am gonna put take a spoon, and I am going to just four separate this from the skin like to do that and kind of flip it over, and we will show you a fun little trick here.

301
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,900
So you do that, do the same with the next avocado.

302
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,800
Just take your spoon kind of scoop it out.

303
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,700
Like so, flip it over.

304
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,100
Now.

305
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,100
You have two nice habit, avocados, right?

306
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
I am going to take my chef knife.

307
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:26,500
And I am just going to slice them like this if your knife sharp and you can move your knife pretty quickly on this go in and out like that.

308
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:38,100
And then I am going to take my hand and go like this and create this little avocado spread here, which looks really beautiful on the plate like this.

309
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,400
And that is a trick that's pretty easy to do.

310
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,100
If you try a few times.

311
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,000
I am only going to do half my avocado to start, getting to the next piece later.

312
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,600
I have some of that charred onion.

313
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,600
We were talking about earlier from the farm.

314
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,600
I like to put that right next to my grilled.

315
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,800
Jalapeño.

316
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,500
I will take my fresh cilantro.

317
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,300
If you see, I am kind of building everything on one side of the plate right now.

318
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,800
That's intentional.

319
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:22,000
We will take some of my mold own salt, give it a little sprinkle of the over the avocado because we love salty avocado, and we cut some lime wedges.

320
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,800
Just cut them.

321
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:30,800
However, you want the build some more of the plate with my line, like so right?

322
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,500
Okay.

323
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,600
My steak is rested.

324
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,700
It's still warm.

325
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,100
My chicken is still in the pot on the stove.

326
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,700
So I know that's warm by Carnitas are on very low heat, then their cast iron pan getting nice and crispy.

327
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:52,400
So I know those are warm if you have, if you have veggies, and they were still in your hot cookie tray.

328
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,800
We can go ahead and start placing your veggies here like to do is the mush mushrooms here.

329
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,300
Maybe the squash, the carrots.

330
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,800
Okay, let us go back to the stake.

331
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,500
If you see here, I am slicing Against the Grain.

332
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,200
You can see that national natural thread Asian of grain of the meat.

333
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:19,200
If you slice against it, you will get a month, tender much more tender bite of meat and if you see this should be cooked.

334
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,900
It's nice and crispy on the outside and cook to a perfect medium-rare medium.

335
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,600
Say that again.

336
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,000
I was fully cooked when you got it.

337
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,600
We're just heating.

338
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,300
It's Ruth.

339
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,700
I am gonna grab some carnitas when we put these on the plate as well.

340
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,900
These have gotten crispy textured.

341
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,000
They're so anxious and flavor.

342
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,600
You see little pockets of fattiness.

343
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,600
And then I am going to take my chicken tinga.

344
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,600
Because with an adobo Pepper marinade that will put that right here.

345
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:03,700
Now.

346
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,800
I have all my proteins.

347
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:14,900
Maybe you have all your veggies on your plate like, so I would go ahead and stick your finger in there and get a little case because it's so delicious.

348
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,500
I am gonna go to my last few ingredients.

349
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:29,200
All right, I have some of these Market vegetables, which are also grown in a local Farm, not the food force that you saw on the video.

350
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,300
These are grown at government Acres.

351
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,900
Then I am going to slice my radish.

352
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,800
You may have radish, you might have turnips.

353
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,000
Maybe Abby.

354
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,300
It's all seasonal.

355
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,400
All depends on which Farm.

356
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,100
It's coming from might have carrots.

357
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,900
They might be yellow.

358
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:52,700
The might be, or I am just going to use these to garnish here because I know when I built my tacos.

359
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,800
I like to have this fresh peppery crunch of radish.

360
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,200
Maybe this fresh crisp, textured of carrot.

361
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,200
So I am going to slice these really thin.

362
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:18,400
On a bias like, so, If these Cuts aren't available to totally cool, you can do a die, you can do a julienne.

363
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,800
You can take a mandolin and slice them really thin.

364
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,200
If you have one of those at home, let me again, I am just building.

365
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,500
I am building the taco plate.

366
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,100
I want to eat.

367
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,400
I am thinking about putting meat in my tortilla or vegetables.

368
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,100
Maybe some cheese, some jalapeno, some avocado.

369
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Some of these, nice fresh crisp vegetables.

370
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:50,700
I am gonna take I was might have my lime wedge that have this package of fresh beautiful herbs, and we're just going to garnish more of our plate with these.

371
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:59,200
You may have some chrysanthemums flower, maybe some diaphanous.

372
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,100
I have here some kale Leaf.

373
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,700
You might have mirror gold.

374
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:14,100
Everyone has something a little bit different, and I am just putting those beautiful garnishes on my plate.

375
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,100
I have already put my smoke.

376
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,700
Fresno, salsa into one.

377
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,700
My Verde sauce into another.

378
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,700
Your avocado didn't go like that actually.

379
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,100
That's alright.

380
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,700
You will do it again.

381
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,000
Your avocado money Bells.

382
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,600
Perfect.

383
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,300
Awesome.

384
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,900
Cool.

385
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,100
I have my tortillas my salsa verde, which is made with tomatillo.

386
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:52,100
It's also made with some aromatics and garlic and onions, how the finial, sodano then we have our smoked Fresno.

387
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,500
Salsa.

388
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,900
Make the to Fresno pepper.

389
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,100
Grilled tomatoes.

390
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,500
How's everyone else deal with their taco place?

391
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
Are they coming along?

392
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,500
If so, I would love to build a taco with you.

393
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,800
Anyone want to build a taco with me?

394
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
All right, I am gonna grab one tortilla.

395
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,600
We're going to build a taco then we're going to go into our taco party lounges, right?

396
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,400
All right, Elizabeth looking hyped up.

397
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,200
Danielle Ashley.

398
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,000
Hello.

399
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,000
Actually, your avocado didn't go this way.

400
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,000
Yeah, so my avocado doesn't look anything like that.

401
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,200
I will give you some footage here.

402
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,100
You can 300 pretty close.

403
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,700
That's what do you think?

404
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,400
It's close?

405
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:22,900
You did a much better job, but I definitely don't think it has some work to disclosure.

406
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,900
I browser working on a sushi restaurant.

407
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,600
So we have done a lot of that I did too.

408
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,700
So that's even more embarrassing like with the plastic wrap on the top of the Dragon Roll.

409
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,100
Yeah.

410
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,600
Yeah, right.

411
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,500
Never for me is what we're learning.

412
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,600
Thoughts of well, I like the effort.

413
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,700
How's yours?

414
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,800
Come out Elizabeth.

415
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,200
Hey my avocados.

416
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,200
This Con Neal not slide.

417
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,100
You know.

418
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,300
This stays just came off.

419
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:05,400
So I am running a little behind but this is awesome.

420
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,400
Maybe you're going a little fast, but you have everything hot.

421
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,900
It looks like your everything ready to go.

422
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,000
It's all going to come together and have been a delicious Taco hard to you.

423
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,700
All right, I am gonna go out and have my first taco from then.

424
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:28,000
We're going to go into our taco party lounges, but anybody who's available to make their Taco now as well.

425
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,000
Let us go ahead and have a bite a toast, a taco toast, if you will.

426
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,600
Oh, yes material, that looks awesome.

427
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,700
Aaron.

428
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,700
That was great.

429
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,500
What's up, bro?

430
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,300
Stock of you build.

431
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,500
I built carnitas.

432
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:09,000
Did you guys build the charger Carnitas and somebody build their veggie tacos, or they love those?

433
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,800
What's a salsa that you like on that?

434
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,500
I like to smoke.

435
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:21,900
Fresno with my car meet this, the red one, put in the chat, your favorite salsa, red or green?

436
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,000
That's a very good point.

437
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,500
Spencer.

438
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,600
You don't need this first.

439
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,000
You're not going to anything else.

440
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,900
We got green red all day.

441
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,900
Verde green.

442
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,199
Yes.

443
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:34,800
Yes.

444
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,500
Yeah, the red is so Smoky, right?

445
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,000
That smokes.

446
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,600
Fresno.

447
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,000
Hmm.

448
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,300
Save some tortillas for your breakfast tacos.

449
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,800
That red salsa goes so good with eggs.

450
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,600
All right, so we're going to move to the taco party Lounge.

451
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,000
If you look at the top of your window at Taco party, will be opening momentarily.

452
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,900
Click on the tab and join the party.

453
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,300
See you back here by clicking kids to the top of your window in about 10 minutes ago.

454
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,600
She knows.

455
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,600
Hello.
