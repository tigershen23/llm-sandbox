1
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,800
Hey, hey, hey, welcome, welcome, welcome.

2
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,300
My name is Robert Ortiz.

3
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,400
And I am the co-founder and CEO of welcome.

4
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:48,400
The platform that you're on here today, looks like we have people joining from around the country and even around the world, I see doubling the building as he Paris, I see Canada.

5
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:56,500
If you have not already, please drop your location and where you're joining us from for real Brazil's in the building Boston is in the building.

6
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,200
Great to see this representation.

7
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Here for this event.

8
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,500
I mean, we're talking about remote work and so it's only makes sense to have remote distributed representation here.

9
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,100
Love, love to see it.

10
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:20,500
You know, I think that the beauty about we're going to get into a lot of the beauty about remote work, but it's a lot of it is to represent it just by even what you're seeing here in chat.

11
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:29,200
Today, we're going to cover a lot of cool things and insights on what's happening in the remote work World, both personally for us.

12
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,500
Us in the market and into the future, you know?

13
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,400
Today I am actually joining you guys from Philadelphia that's my hometown.

14
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,300
However, I am living and I have moved since the pandemic to Puerto Rico so give me those to all you guys doing from there as well.

15
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,700
Quick housekeeping.

16
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:52,600
This is I know it's different platform for some of you folks, but we're going to have a strong emphasis on Q&A.

17
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:59,300
We have two amazing speakers there in the green room right now, they're going to join me on stage, and we want to have a conversation with all of you.

18
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,300
So ask questions come up.

19
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,200
As we get into these topics, please.

20
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,400
Please drop your question in the Q&A tab, on the right-hand side.

21
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:15,400
If you need any help with, like exploring the platform and such get the help tab on the right-hand side and somebody who love to show you around.

22
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,400
Now, let us go ahead and set the stage set, the table per se.

23
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,800
Why are we here today?

24
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,600
Well, outside of hearing from two phenomenal leaders in the remote work space.

25
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:39,300
We're here today because We're all being impacted whether professionally or personally by the shift that's happening and the shift that's automatically shifting how we work in changing, how we work.

26
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:47,300
You know, a couple weeks ago, I was in a gathering with other leaders in business and I joined this breakout session.

27
00:07:47,400 --> 00:08:08,500
It was titled remote hybrid or in the office and the room was packed to the walls and I grabbed a see in the middle of the room because I needed it to listen to this conversation and you I felt the tension in the air, you know, this is like polarizing perspectives that some folks carry about where things should be at.

28
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:19,000
Is it in the office is a hybrid is a remote the pros and cons of it all and depending on where you stand, it can be very polarising today though, we're diving into the beauty of remote work.

29
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Why it works?

30
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,700
How companies that get it, right?

31
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,600
Have an unfair advantage and what that means into the future.

32
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:32,600
Now before we kick that off about, why don't we kick off with a quick poll to just quickly pull the audience here.

33
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,700
Today, just would love to understand, where are you working?

34
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,200
Primarily today?

35
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Is it primarily remote, primarily hybrid in office sometimes remote at home sometimes or just purely in the office?

36
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,400
We have a lot of remote only representation here today which is, which is great to see.

37
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
Which is pretty.

38
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,000
It makes sense.

39
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,300
Right?

40
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,500
The topics that were covering.

41
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,800
Good to see that.

42
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,500
Looks like a 60% remote only audience here.

43
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
So, good to see it.

44
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,300
Now, I am gonna go ahead and get a little bit of speakers.

45
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,600
Backgrounds, it covered.

46
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,400
So maybe let me get myself out the way.

47
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:21,100
So again, my name is Roberto and welcome is on a mission to help companies change the way they gather engage and Inspire their remote control.

48
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:27,200
He's, we are fully remote company, and we're doing the technology to empower the distributed Workforce.

49
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,400
Now, Tony Jamis who's joining us as well.

50
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,800
He is the co-founder and CEO of oyster.

51
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:57,400
If you have not learned about what you need to learn about oyster, they're changing the way you recruit and connect with employees around the world, he is an again, he is the founder and CEO of oyster and there are Global and Schmidt platforms that empowers companies higher pay and care for their teammates regardless of where they are, Tony is also a future of work activists.

52
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Are we going to get into that in a minute?

53
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:05,800
Passionate about the global benefits of distributed work and how that's changing worldwide.

54
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:12,200
And how that's the impact that's having on both people and the economy and Chris heard?

55
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,500
He's the founder and CEO of First Base.

56
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:37,700
You probably seen both of these guys, flooding your Twitter, and/or your LinkedIn because I know I always tune in whenever these guys are posting and Chris leads first base, which is a hard word as a service platform that enables companies to set up manage and retrieve all physical equipment of remote workers and their needs.

57
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Chris, founded first based on the belief that everyone should have more time with the people that care about most all while doing their best work.

58
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,200
So guys, Why don't you guys put it together and chat?

59
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,900
Give it up for both Chris and Tony who's joining us here on stage.

60
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,200
Anyone Tony Chris, good to see you guys?

61
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,300
Hey, thanks for joining us.

62
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,000
First of all, I think, you know, we were just talking about in The Green Room.

63
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,600
I have been looking forward to this conversation quite a bit.

64
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,600
I have gotten to know you guys and different levels as well.

65
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:25,600
But to have this representation on stage to talk about remote work, I can't think about two other people besides you two to drive the conversation.

66
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,500
So, thank you for being here.

67
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,000
Well, thank you for welcoming us on the welcome platform.

68
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,400
Yeah, absolutely.

69
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So really quick.

70
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,400
Small fun fact as well.

71
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,000
You know doing some background on both of you guys.

72
00:11:42,900 --> 00:12:04,600
We all live in different parts of the world, and we call home to different parts of the world, and we all live on an island in different parts of the world which is really fascinating you know, home for me is Puerto Rico Chris, you're in Scotland and Tony you in Cyprus in the middle of the Mediterranean which is In to see that, you know, I talk to people all the time.

73
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:11,400
I would never thought my wife and I always dreamed of going back to Puerto Rico and I will, we stop that.

74
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,800
I can't do that because I am building a tech company.

75
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,500
I am trying to progress my tech sort of career.

76
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:23,600
And here we are right doing that living where we want to live and building what we want to do build.

77
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,900
So in the core of our conversation you know we're going to be breaking up our conversation into three pillars.

78
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:36,500
Number one is the A personal impact of remote work and how to get that right for ourselves.

79
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,400
And what we're seeing is best practices because we know the shift to remote work.

80
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:52,900
It starts with us personally, I do, we have the right things in place for us to succeed personally, as we take on remote work, number two, the impact and the market, that remote work is having on the market.

81
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:58,300
And the, lastly, how is remote work shaping the future and those are the three key areas.

82
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,100
So don't, why don't we kick off with the first one?

83
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,800
Which is Around the personal impact of remote work.

84
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:17,300
So, with all that I already covered is pretty clear to say that we're all Champions over about work outside of building companies, for remote work, outside of building distributed teams.

85
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,900
We're also impacted personally by remote work.

86
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,100
So, just the first question.

87
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,500
How has remote work impacted both of you on a personal level?

88
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,700
And if you can unpack that for us here today, Tony when we Compass here.

89
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:42,400
Yeah, so it's really gives gave me freedom and flexibility to design the life that I want to live.

90
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:57,300
So, starting from where I want to live to how I want to work, how much time I want to spend with my children, how much I want time, I spend on myself, so, so just to give you some examples of how I do this.

91
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:13,800
So as you mentioned, I live on the island of Cyprus, I have always thought Cyprus Was the most beautiful country in the world 17 years ago, when I was there and, and, and, and that opportunity enabled me to pick where I want to live in the world in a place that I want to call home.

92
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:25,700
I spent the last 40 years of my life, pretty much all my life living in cities, chasing job opportunities and in London and Bay Area and Paris and so on and so forth.

93
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,600
And I just, I am done with living in cities.

94
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't want to live in cities and for me, when I wanted to start this company, I It to work for me, first and foremost.

95
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,400
So it gave me a takes ability of location.

96
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:42,400
It gave me also the opportunity to design the life, I want to have.

97
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,800
So I don't work in the morning because most of my team is in Europe and in the u.s.

98
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,000
Time zone, so I work in the afternoon and in the evening.

99
00:14:50,400 --> 00:15:07,200
So I spent the morning with my children, exercising doing whatever I want to do and in the afternoon I have a one-hour where I can spend with my children On the beach to connect with them and then Friday we don't do meetings.

100
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,600
We called it focused Friday where it enables me to, to get stuff done.

101
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:12,800
That.

102
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,400
I need to get before going to the weekend, and then we completely disconnect over the weekend.

103
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,200
So but that cannot be possible.

104
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,600
If the organization doesn't allow that.

105
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,500
So we can talk about this.

106
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:34,800
Maybe later in the conversation is that it's it has to be something that is shared this way of living as See, this Freedom across the organization.

107
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,700
Yeah, let us get into that on the second half of this topic because I think that it's important to, I mean, we you just switch on remote.

108
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,200
It doesn't take care of all the problems.

109
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,400
It has to be wrapped in intention and discipline has to be part of that.

110
00:15:49,400 --> 00:16:05,000
But Chris fill us in on your remote sort of like how has it impacted you and by the way Tony and Chris are Super Active fathers, and they both have little babies right now as part of not just running a global company.

111
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,500
But also Raising kids and promote life, just changes that.

112
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,100
And so Chris, why don't you fill us in on that impact for you?

113
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:19,200
Yeah I think echoing well of for Tony said it was a quality life decision for me as well.

114
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,700
Miss. my first daughter walking laughing talking for the first time working in an office.

115
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,000
Had that question in my head which I remember having a conversation with my dad where I was like, this sucks.

116
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,200
Right?

117
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,800
Like, why am I missing the events to my kids lives?

118
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,600
He's like, that's how Oh, it's Gotta Be.

119
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,900
You gotta work to put a roof over your kids heads.

120
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,700
And I think for me it was like, well maybe it doesn't have to be like that.

121
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,900
And then founded my first business, we had a bunch of Discovery around all the challenges in operating that way.

122
00:16:48,900 --> 00:17:05,500
And then eventually we came to build first base and I think what's became important for me over the time between having that realization and today, and all the things I have done since then it's probably the realization that no other time in history, could I be doing what I am doing today.

123
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,599
We were speaking about this beforehand where we have raised a bunch of money from some of the most prominent investors in the world without ever stepping foot in San Francisco.

124
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:19,700
And until it was recently as two or three years ago, that would have been impossible.

125
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,099
And I think like, yeah, Tony speaks about this a lot, the ability to democratize access to opportunity is a huge part of this.

126
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:46,200
There are incredibly talented people all around the world and being able to give them access to the best opportunities globally is such A huge enabler, whether it's single parents whether it's people with health conditions or impairments, but there's people that Just Can't Get Right visa to work in some of the more affluent parts of the world.

127
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,400
So that's being the real driver for me, trying to make that change.

128
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:58,100
And obviously personally having that impact with my kids, my family while still being able to do the best work I have done in my life.

129
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Now that no doubt thanks to Sharon, and I like to jump in and add I was with what Chris said is that It also enabled me to reduce my carbon footprint and also great.

130
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,500
Gain more stability in my life.

131
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:24,400
So before starting this company, I was, I was a CEO of another company and used to spend half of my time every month in another continent.

132
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:33,600
I was in constant jet lag and when I took my transition to move this company, I run the numbers and see what's, what is my CO2 footprint?

133
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,700
And 90% of it was air travel.

134
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:43,500
And I want to be able to live and work and lead a successful company without the need to continuously be on a plane.

135
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,200
Now, in-person meetings are important, and we can touch base on why they are uncertain to make promote work.

136
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,500
But, but it has, it doesn't need to be the case to get stuff done.

137
00:18:53,500 --> 00:19:01,100
So you can massively reduce your carbon footprint as a human, when you work from remotely.

138
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,100
Yeah, yeah, no doubt, no doubt.

139
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,600
You know, it's interesting.

140
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:13,200
Now, every time I travel, I first always start with the question of why like, is this, this is this trip.

141
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,600
Really, really necessary.

142
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,200
And typically it's not.

143
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:24,200
And now, when you go into running a company and let us say, way into that, because Tony you touched on this first.

144
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,500
Second here, around being set up for success in a remote.

145
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:38,500
You know, remote first remove oriented sort of culture, you know, just one thing just today.

146
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,400
I am in Philadelphia, I am visiting family.

147
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:52,100
I have been out here for a couple of weeks, and I was just like, mind-boggled, because I was sitting in traffic and I typically don't sit in traffic to go to work.

148
00:19:52,100 --> 00:20:01,600
I am flipping anywhere, we walk into my office, and I am sitting there for an hour and it just Crazy.

149
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,300
Sort of like, I was taken aback by.

150
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,700
This was my normal for ten years.

151
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:22,300
I commute it two hours back and forth to work back in my early career, and I am glad that we don't have to do that but now as Leaders of companies and people managers and Chris you touch about this as well.

152
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:30,000
Like, you know, remote working remotely takes discipline, it takes attention, both discipline at the individual level, it takes attention.

153
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,400
In it takes trust leading with trust and assuming with trust.

154
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,500
What can companies do to help?

155
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,900
Like to help them succeed and to shift to remote?

156
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,100
Like if I am a people leader leading a team, and I am jumping into remote or my company just went remote friendly?

157
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,400
What are some of the things I could be doing to improve how we work remotely?

158
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,000
What are those things that come to mind for you guys?

159
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,600
Chris.

160
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,600
Yeah, this is a conversation.

161
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:09,400
I have had with everyone from exacts of global Banks to friends and family who live a globally.

162
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:18,400
And often the question I think becomes from an office first perspective, like how do you trust your people to do the work and the push back to?

163
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,100
That is really easy which is like you hire people without trusting them.

164
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,100
And like I think there's still a world in which that's true, right?

165
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:38,000
Like you spend all this time interviewing people, you check that they have these competencies and now you're not going to trust them to do the things that they want to do and I think to your point the commuting things I think Super interesting.

166
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:52,800
You look at that, the way we used to live as people spending 90% of their day getting ready for traveling to sitting in an office and by the time they get home, they have missed their kids, they leave before their kids.

167
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,800
Wake up, they got home after the kids have gone and bad their Partners exhausted.

168
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,100
They have got no time for friends.

169
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,300
Families and hobbies.

170
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And we wondered like, why are people not enjoying work?

171
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:12,700
Well, it's because they're sat in an office chair night and 5, and they don't have any time to do the things that make them happiest, which enables them to do, the best work that they have ever done in their lives.

172
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,000
And I think the final thing which I hear a law, which is how do we do it right?

173
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,500
Like, how do we do this thing?

174
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:27,500
We don't understand that and what typically that happens is, we're going to wrap Replicate the office remotely rather than leveraging, the benefits of remote.

175
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:35,400
And I think companies that begin remote, they maximize that they have more written culture, they communicate asynchronously more.

176
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:46,600
Tony, I spoke about the focus Friday, so carving out that time to do deep focus work without distractions, companies are just going to replicate the 925, they're going to track people's clicks.

177
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,700
They're never actually going to get any of the true benefit of remote work.

178
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,000
And I think getting over that hump and recognizing the status quo Me different.

179
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,700
That's maybe the two biggest things I see.

180
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:04,300
Yeah, the data you know was interesting Chris about that is 12 company's responsibility on.

181
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Putting these Frameworks in place you know, Freedom Fridays.

182
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,400
It was a focus Fridays.

183
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:25,100
It sounds like Freedom Fridays in my mind as well, freedom from meeting, but yes, but it's also like personally as an individual, I have to change as well, because if I, if I was already working 10 years and that was my Norm habitually.

184
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,600
I already, you know, running out the door.

185
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,800
This does this, do this.

186
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,100
Now I have control of my time.

187
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
What does that look like?

188
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,400
How do I put things in place?

189
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,000
That bring me life, that set me up.

190
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:49,500
Well, because for some people that commute and listening to Joe Rogan on the way to work, was there your transition from life to work and now us individually.

191
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,900
Working remotely, we have to build what works for us, and that takes some tension and it takes a lot of discipline to do that as well.

192
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,400
Tony, I know, Do you have a lot to say about this stuff as well?

193
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,500
We love to pull up to here.

194
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,700
Three things that I see a so company.

195
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,300
And we did as well as we adopted a successful remote work.

196
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,300
Model one is to intentionally build trust.

197
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:28,200
This is important because as you work remotely, you don't have these emotional signaling that come with body language and so it's harder to build trust in a remote environment.

198
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:34,000
So you need to be intentional and building trust it You part of our, one of the three values we have posters about.

199
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:55,200
What we do is we build trust and how we do it is by creating the maximum amount of safety, emotional safety for people not to be afraid to make mistakes, not to be afraid to say something wrong, is to be there for people when this happened and support them on that journey and it's a lot about storage from the top, right?

200
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:04,200
So the way you as a leader react to bad news, determine for instance, how the Company is coming to consider emotional safety and build trust.

201
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,200
We talk a lot about assuming best intent.

202
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:14,500
You have to have the default mode as you are in a remote work environment to assume that the other person has with the good intention.

203
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Whatever these thoughts that you have in your brain, you have let them go and focus on best intention.

204
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
That's number one is building.

205
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:30,600
Trust number two, is you need to be very specific in how you measure and Define results.

206
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,600
Because you're not anymore.

207
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:47,000
Assessing people on their presence in the office when we moved from the Industrial Revolution, from the factory to the office, we kept some of these managerial techniques of measuring people on how many widgets they produce or how much time they spend in the office.

208
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,200
And then so, so that ship in how we measure performance has to change.

209
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,700
And, and it has to be a more intentional process to set goals, from the company, level to the individual level.

210
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:08,000
And thirdly is to be clear of how you work together, what are the tools and the rules about collaboration of the company.

211
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,700
You need to put train people on it.

212
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,800
You need to model the way you as a leader, and you need to evolve it over time.

213
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:23,600
So three things, building trust having result driven culture and, and be clear about the tools and the rules.

214
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:30,100
And, and by the way, like even if you're in office company and you do these three things, you get better.

215
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:44,100
Moving to the note, exposes your weaknesses as an organization and become a forcing function to address some of these high performance Behavior, building trust, having clear results, having clear way of collaboration.

216
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:55,300
That's why I believe that the distributed company on through tomorrow are going to be the best companies now da, da Tony thanks for breaking it, breaking it down that way.

217
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:00,600
You know I think the one thing that stands out from that is going remote exposes.

218
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,600
All the gaps because you have nothing else to stand on.

219
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,700
But good process, good tools, good ways of working without that, everything just falls apart.

220
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:18,300
You know, let us shift gears into the impact that remote is having in the market.

221
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:19,900
You know?

222
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:27,800
Like we were part of these conversations all the time, you know, 24/7, Chris Tony myself.

223
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:40,900
We're involved in these conversations because we're Using for this future, where I not only for ourselves individual, he's for our families, but also for our teammates, and the technology, we're building.

224
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,400
The services were building is powering that shift as well.

225
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:56,400
But when you look at the reports that are coming up, you know, every week, there's another report about the benefits of remote what employees want.

226
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,400
There's, the war of the office and not office City, Teas or empty Office business.

227
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,700
Buildings are empty.

228
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:12,800
Even after companies are trying to perk, put all the perks, put the Rhode show on and get people with come back to the office.

229
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:28,200
It's pretty clear that employees want flexibility, they want freedom if we bring up this Forbes overlay there was this report recently cited around just the simple fact that remote is here to stay and it will continue to increase.

230
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:37,700
But what I found interesting about the They was that ninety percent of people surveyed found, it promises more productive remote.

231
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,600
The impact on their mental health was better and even post pandemic.

232
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,300
They're saying, this is what I want.

233
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,900
I want remote to be a permanent fixture in how I work.

234
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And, and the way that I work, the voice, the voices of the employees.

235
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,500
Come back really drastically on that.

236
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:05,700
However, there's been resistance As well from leaders and companies on this argument as well.

237
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:23,800
You know, I don't know which one of you may be that said, this, but it was something around the fact that this is the biggest shift that we're seeing in Tony, you touched on this recently, as well, kind of taking this back to the Industrial Age, this is the biggest shift we're seeing in 100 years in how we work.

238
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:41,300
Being able to hire people from around the world, being able to go to schedule, run your life versus around work, being able to get two hours back a day and commute being able to, for me, make pancakes for my little girl, every morning and to tuck her in every night.

239
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:49,000
That's, that's all that I know, I don't know, no other type of fatherhood, but that's my normal today and that's changing is going to have an impact on her life.

240
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,100
Is going to have an impact on my life and on our family's life.

241
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,200
How would you both?

242
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:55,400
With.

243
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,700
Summarize or articulate the actual shift that we're in because I every conversation I am in.

244
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,600
I have to bring people back to.

245
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:17,200
We're just in the beginning of the shift that when we look back 10 years from now, we're going to see, you know what, that to three year spans that five-year span that was the biggest shift, but we're just in the middle of it.

246
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,200
And sometimes we don't realize how big of a shift it is.

247
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,500
How would you articulate the shift that were undergoing right now?

248
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,700
You know, take off first or nay So far, it's Chris Cole.

249
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,100
Yeah this is a conversation.

250
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:42,700
I have with a lot of particularly investors, journalists friends family and I think there is a lot of Doubt, right?

251
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:49,600
There's a lot of media articles that are written by Rich real estate owners that will tell you the office is coming back.

252
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,600
And if you look at the date that they are doesn't really support that.

253
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,800
And when you dig in with people who the least offices, they don't support that either.

254
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,500
The more people I talk to Single day.

255
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:09,100
The more they tell me that they haven't the least new space in the last three years, and they won't the least new species space in the next 2.

256
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:17,000
So the belief that people can even go back to the office, even if they want to, is totally false companies.

257
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,200
Don't have enough space.

258
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:25,900
And I think, like, the second component is the best companies of today are leaning heavily into remote work.

259
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:36,100
You look at Airbnb doordash twilio You Yelp all of them have announced in the last couple of months that they're fully remote and that's a forcing function, right?

260
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:46,000
If the most desirable jobs are remote, the most talented people will go and work for those businesses, and they will Force the other companies to become more remote.

261
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,200
I spoke to Cal Newport about this as like a darwinian moment.

262
00:31:50,200 --> 00:32:10,300
For remote work Evolution, eventually the most remote companies were in, and they kill companies aren't removed and people don't believe that and My approach to that has been well, what metaphor can we used to help them understand that and the one that I have kind of settled on is the rise of e-commerce on the internet, right?

263
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,400
Go back to the early, 2000's.

264
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,000
How much stuff did you buy on the internet then?

265
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,700
Like, even when eBay was first around, I am Amazon with burst around hardly anyone.

266
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,500
But hardly anything online by 2010, that changed the law, right?

267
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:33,400
I am as in matured ebayid, matured more people, some people bought some things online fast-forward too today.

268
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:40,600
Almost everyone buys, almost everything online, cars houses you order your food and it turns up at your door.

269
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,500
And I think like taking that piece where we started, which is like, this is the most important shift in 100 years.

270
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Well, let us recognize how big a platform shift is.

271
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,600
It's the end of probably 30 years of innovation, right?

272
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,500
Mobile Computing, the internet communication software.

273
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,500
R like this, we have needed all this.

274
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:10,000
And I think the inevitable conclusion of that is you can work with anyone anywhere in the world irrespective of their geographic location.

275
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:25,200
And yeah, I think the consequence of that is that it's the biggest shift in 100 years It is pretty clear and pretty, pretty clear, Chris that you have been talking about this and thinking about this, for some time I get it.

276
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,400
That's, that's good stuff.

277
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,500
I will come on Tony.

278
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:36,800
Yeah, yeah, I mean it is a massive shift, and I am going to tell you what is driving that shift.

279
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,400
I mean, like, what is like, even this is a macro micro world we live in today.

280
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,000
Me give you some data point.

281
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:56,300
According to BCG even pre-pandemic, there were 90 million job remote knowledge, work job going unfulfilled in the west that's eight point.

282
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,500
Five trillion dollar of economic loss.

283
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,300
At the same time.

284
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:14,800
In the next 10 years were going to have 1.5 billion knowledge workers coming into the workforce, mostly in emerging economies.

285
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:22,300
That's the biggest demographic shift in workers demographic since the Industrial Revolution.

286
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:33,100
Combined, with what Chris said, at the maturity of Internet platform, collaboration software and the infrastructure that Chris is building for remote work.

287
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:44,699
It's going to enable these millions of people to participate in the global economy, Bryan Caplan Economist from George Mason University.

288
00:34:44,699 --> 00:35:00,000
Argues in his book, open borders that if you remove the concept of borders from Talent Mobility we can triple the world GDP 3x and knowing how much growth this capitalistic system needed to sustain itself?

289
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:10,300
I don't see any scenario in the future That doesn't enable these companies in the west to tap into this massive talent pool that is coming online in the next 10 years.

290
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,700
No doubt, no doubt.

291
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:26,900
I have you know, you have been talking about the impact to the economy, not just a shift in like, how we work, but the shift and unlocking opportunity, I am not going economic power.

292
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:36,700
I think about even the work that you're doing right now Tony with making it easier to hire people from around the world.

293
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:46,100
The impact that has on that person on R household, their family on their generation without them having to leave their family in the first place.

294
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:55,600
You know, a lot of people leave from they leave their family behind to go earn some income and better enrich their families back home.

295
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,300
Now, with this shift, what we're saying is, you don't have to leave, you can stay where you are.

296
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:08,900
We're going to enrich that unit and change that life, and that, that household as well, which is even the undercurrent of all of this.

297
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:18,400
There's this other shift, that's On a global scale, not just on the headlines of what we see, not just what he line puts out on Twitter and not just what, you know.

298
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,900
Somebody else who says in office is the only way.

299
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:40,600
It's the global scale to the impact that this has on the economy, which is really, really great to see, you know, one thing I have this overlay, I am going to bring this up, you know, Tony your team has put out an employee expectations report recently, and it's pretty clear in the fine.

300
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,100
Things that parties just have changed, right?

301
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:49,900
44 percent of remote work says, it's the top three factors in their ideal companies.

302
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,400
They're looking for remote work as a thing there.

303
00:36:52,400 --> 00:37:06,700
Expect 60% of them are expected to be able to work from anywhere, from their employers, and eighty, eighty percent of folks are saying that it's become so much, much more important since a pandemic for them to work remotely.

304
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,600
And, you know, numbers don't lie like when you have these conversations.

305
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,100
The folks us as Leaders, we're always hiring, folks.

306
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:24,500
I can't imagine saying I am not going to hire the best person best qualified person for the job regardless of where they're located because they're not willing to step foot into the office.

307
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:36,000
This is part of that big shift, the big shift I feel is like not just We have the technology to enable us to connect and work remotely.

308
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,500
Not just that there's been two years of us being forced to work remotely and productivity has gone up and the world continues to go around.

309
00:37:43,900 --> 00:38:02,300
But also I think the sentiment for us as people to say, you know what, like work is always been super important to me, but in recent years, what I have realized is that my life is more important to me and giving all these hardships that we're going through in the world.

310
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:10,000
This reprioritization at the it was really pushing the investment of remote because of employees that want to show up at the office.

311
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,600
Then what, what options do employers have?

312
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,300
I posted an article recently?

313
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:29,000
I think was yesterday that showed from a survey, a poll server that you're giving out in the market employers, want these many days, these many days of work from home, only employees when these many days.

314
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And what's happening is the chart is showing that companies are Moving towards what employees want?

315
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:48,800
Because employees control that story, which is, which is great to see, you know, Chris I when I see your pink background, show up in my Twitter or my LinkedIn and I typically just stop scrolling to see what's up.

316
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You have clearly had taken a strong stance on remote and you get into these back-and-forth with folks that have these opposing views and it's a great to see.

317
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,500
And it's Great content.

318
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:11,100
What, what, what have been, some of your, you know, your learnings from that because you're in it every single day, you're having these conversations, it threads?

319
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,200
What has been your learnings from being vocal and taken the stance on both sides of the party?

320
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:22,000
Because I am sure you're getting opposing views that try to shoot down a post that you put up?

321
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:29,800
Yes, I think some people have extremely strong reactions to some of the things I say, and I think that's good, right?

322
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:40,600
Like this is a grand experiment at the end of two years of incredibly difficult times in people's lives and I think it's important to shine a light on that.

323
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,900
Not everybody doesn't want the same thing, right?

324
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,000
Like you look at the day to Leo's day, I was maybe the most interesting what they released.

325
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,800
99% of people never want to go back to an office again, full-time.

326
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:59,800
That's a fact, for a, 50% of people never want to go back to an office at all.

327
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,600
That's a fact, two or three percent of people do want to go back to the office.

328
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:10,200
And I think there's a real danger that 23 percent are Extremely Loud.

329
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:17,000
They're disproportionately and management position, so they're going to determine what other people do and that's a problem.

330
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,500
I think your point on The, the amount of work that people want is super interesting, right?

331
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,900
I think those numbers come out with something like two point.

332
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,100
Eight days a week is what?

333
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,600
Workers want, employees want to give them 1.2.

334
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:44,700
And I think that is very interesting and it's very interesting because I think we need to name the white elephant in the room, which is everyone for the most part, there were only three million remote workers in the u.s.

335
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,500
Prior covid.

336
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:52,600
There's going to be 30 million plus immediately after there is going to be someone something like 80 million by 2030.

337
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,400
They want to point eight days.

338
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,700
At the end of a pandemic in the worst possible remote working conditions.

339
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,100
They couldn't travel, couldn't see their friends, they couldn't see their families, their homeschooling their kids.

340
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,000
So, they have had pandemic remote work, and they still want to point eight days at home.

341
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:20,200
Wait, until they got the intangible benefits that we have experienced right being able to live where you want being able to travel, more being able to Your kids.

342
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,500
And I think that's the most important part, right?

343
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:29,200
We me and Tony are companies build the Bullring Dusty unsexy part of remote work, right?

344
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,600
We build the infrastructure that enables teams to choose it really easily.

345
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:37,200
We can stay here all day and talk about the future work until we go blue in the face.

346
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:47,000
Why I really care about is the future a living and that's the real conversation I like to have with people, which is like, let us not just talk about work, but like what's the impact?

347
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,800
What's the outcome?

348
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,300
We told our own stories.

349
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,600
Right, Rob, you're in Pittsburgh, Tony is Miss. Tilly.

350
00:41:53,600 --> 00:42:03,300
Now I am going to lie down, we can't get in crisper, we can't get pissed, buried in Philly or be used as we got two NFL teams and then it's like, it gets messy, it gets messy.

351
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,300
But yeah, it like the real is everyone has a story and when you speak to someone you learn about them.

352
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,500
And yeah, that's what really matters here.

353
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,500
How can we enable that?

354
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,600
How can we build a bridge to a better future a living for billions of people globally?

355
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,800
Let us segue into that their topic here, because we're going to get into some audience Q&A.

356
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,100
And I want to make sure we respect for will be also times as well.

357
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,700
Just a reminder, if you have questions, I am sure you guys have a lot of questions.

358
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,600
Let us go ahead and drop those questions in the Q&A tab.

359
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,900
On the right-hand side of both the ones you want.

360
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,900
We will cover them here in a few minutes.

361
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:44,000
Let us segue into the third part of our conversation which is the impact in the future of work.

362
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,500
And I mean Chris you just said it you beat me to the punch here.

363
00:42:47,700 --> 00:43:01,800
But you said this countless times when I think it's really intriguing that it's not the future of work is the future of living and will love to unpack that a little bit more because, you know, yes, we have shared it us three.

364
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:18,400
Yes, we have it benefits us as well, but we're legit and living, we're living the story, we're living the, the benefit of remote and the impact that has on our living and what that means to us, Chris.

365
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,800
I mean what was in it.

366
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,500
I mean you're talking about this stuff all the time what was that shift in your mind?

367
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500
Because future workers been always a thing.

368
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:47,500
And I think organically, we have all just been having these conversations in our homes, with our partners, with our friends and say you know what like we have come to a Tipping Point that the last few years have been completely nuts on a Global Spectrum.

369
00:43:47,600 --> 00:44:19,200
Mm, and you start to prioritize things, you know, I don't know if I want to give up all these other things in my life, to show up at this job or to work at this place and parties, have shifted data is proving that Chris, what can you do in fact that just a little bit more the future within Crossing that office, saying let us change the mindset to just the future of living and starting from that place and then figuring out Work in that world.

370
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:32,500
For sure, I think that started with a conversation which begins with like four of the first principles of why like, why do people want remote work and where we got to with that?

371
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:41,200
And we're often begins is all this work led to Broken ways of living and you start to unpack that and you say, okay, what does that mean?

372
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:48,200
Well, if you go back 50 years, people spent more time in their local communities that were affiliated with churches.

373
00:44:48,200 --> 00:45:05,400
There was boot clubs, there was net in clubs and like whatever your feelings are about any of those things, like unquestionably people were more plugged into their Community, they were closer their friends, they were closer or their families and as the work they elongate people commute it for longer, they got less of those things.

374
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:18,700
And like the office today is this Adult kids club distraction Factory filled with ping pong tables and games consoles, where it's actually incredibly difficult to do your work.

375
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,500
And the reason for that is they want to keep you there for longer, right?

376
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,500
That's the way to maximize productivity.

377
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:32,200
Well, actually, like, perhaps there's a better way of working here, which is, if you start to trust people, you give them what they want.

378
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,300
The implication of that is they have a higher quality of life because they can travel more, and yeah, that lets not aim for a better future.

379
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:39,700
Work.

380
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,900
Who cares about that?

381
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,700
Let us aim for a better future a living.

382
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,700
So much easier and deeper way connect with people engaging with them on a real conversation.

383
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,400
No doubt, I love that.

384
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,000
I would love Crossing all the future work.

385
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:03,700
It just changes where you start from and you're starting from you first not the job, you're asking yourselves those deeper questions of why work?

386
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,100
What is the means to the end?

387
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:10,600
Is it, you know, it goes back to this one story or tail around.

388
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:19,400
Like, you know, like we have just been wired to work, work, work at all expenses and you're working, so that you can provide for your family.

389
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,700
So, You can spend time with your kids, so that you can do all these things.

390
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:39,800
And what I love about this shift is starting their first and asking how does work impact my life not the other way around, you know, Tony would love to get your thoughts on is segueing into the future a little bit broader than bike.

391
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,700
The now, let us go further out.

392
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:46,300
Let us go five years out and let us take, let us wrap up this conversation with.

393
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,600
Where are we going like Beyond?

394
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,000
And the impact on the shift that we're in right now.

395
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,500
How is this going to change cities?

396
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,300
How is it going to change real estate?

397
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,600
How is it going to change a ton of did?

398
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,000
I mean, there's a ton of things that would that's going to change over.

399
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
The next five years will love to Anchor.

400
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,500
Their what are some predictions?

401
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,300
What are some thoughts?

402
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:10,400
Some trends that you guys are seeing Tony would love to start with you.

403
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,400
And Chris, we can wrap up with you and we will go into Q&A here.

404
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:27,400
There are certain prediction that I would like to see happening in the next five to ten years and I will start with the more equal pay for equal work across the world.

405
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:36,800
It's a very charged topic, and we have seen some data that is encouraging a toaster because we employed people, we have all the employment data.

406
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:45,000
If your remote worker employed from an Emerging Market employed, for a company in the west, you at least can double your salary from local.

407
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:45,500
It's right.

408
00:47:45,500 --> 00:48:02,800
So that's a huge impact on many developing economies, especially as you shift, the direct investment from north to south and add more investment into these economies than just remittance which is today, most of what economists get.

409
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,800
So number one is really about moving into a world.

410
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:33,600
Transfer economy, the 1.5 billion I mentioned earlier, secondly, is a like to see this to create an opportunity for increasing diversity and Workforce, think about just think about gender diversity now.

411
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,500
Now, half of my team are women with Children, what?

412
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:42,900
Why it's possible for technology company we to have over 60 percent of their Workforce.

413
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:51,300
Women in 70 countries is because we were able to provide its Civil way of working that makes people successful and no matter how they want to work.

414
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,100
And, and so, so I would like to see a world where there's, there's more diversity.

415
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:08,700
Presented representation, thirdly, is, is really around the decline of urban areas and, and the so.

416
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:16,700
So we today, we pour the equivalent of four times, New York City in concrete to build urban areas in the world.

417
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:26,400
That is not sustainable and a big majority of people that lives in the city, don't want to leave the city, they are forced to be in that place.

418
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:36,400
Now some people might decide to want to be in cities and that's great, but many of the population in urban areas don't want to be in urban areas.

419
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:52,000
So, so I do expect that we're going to see the Revival of secondary cities countries by the living was going to become More than norm, and what's going to happen that means that people are more connected with their communities.

420
00:49:52,100 --> 00:50:00,300
People are more connected with nature and that has an impact on mental health and as well as the environment, right?

421
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:10,400
Because you if you're if you don't need to commute and if you're reducing your consumption footprint because you're not in a consumption world.

422
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,200
You know, I last time I was in New York like I was wondering what else?

423
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:25,500
But I am going to buy next like I had This feeling that suddenly that all these advertisement in my face, and all these shops, like, this didn't want to sell me stuff, but I don't want to buy.

424
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:36,700
And, and so, so it's really an opportunity to, to get out of this consumption trap that we have been fed by big Corporation.

425
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,800
And, so I do see that to be a very important move for Humanity.

426
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,300
No doubt, no doubt love it.

427
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,600
I mean, I think I The future, the future is bright.

428
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,400
According to those key things crisp top three on your side.

429
00:50:53,400 --> 00:51:00,200
I know you put a long list post recently about the this as well, and then we will get into open Q&A for the last 10 minutes here.

430
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:08,900
Yeah, I think for me the biggest one which seems most obvious to me that maybe is still most contrarian.

431
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:16,300
Is that a majority of the desk jobs globally will be done remotely and majority of the time by 2030?

432
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,800
Like to me that seems inevitable.

433
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,600
So inevitable.

434
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,700
It's barely worth speaking.

435
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,100
About lot of people disagree with that.

436
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:30,500
Number to the best companies will spend over 75 percent of their time, working asynchronously.

437
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,900
Again something I see growing incredibly quickly in the fastest growing tech companies.

438
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,800
Go boy, typically, that's a trend that's extrapolated elsewhere, right?

439
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:55,300
Wherever the tech companies do most people fall and then the final one, which relates to, the is a rise in the, the need for Quality writing, I think it's a skill that gets and has been lost in offices.

440
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:00,100
Where the loudest person in the room often wins, and that shouldn't be the case.

441
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:10,200
It's the people who have The best ideas who change the world and I think that piece is incredibly important which again, is something I see playing out in a lot of businesses.

442
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,100
No doubt, no doubt love it.

443
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:20,900
You know, part of me is like, this, everything you guys are saying I am like over here, snapping my fingers, and I am pretty sure a lot of folks that are watching are as well.

444
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,200
Let us get into Q&A.

445
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,100
I see a lot of things happening in chat.

446
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:37,200
If we get it to the top questions here for free guys, to upvote your most you most potent question here will get the top ones about it onto the stage so kicking off with Jen.

447
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,300
How do you help create a hybrid environment or remote opportunities?

448
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,900
For jobs that are Hands-On and can't be completely.

449
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:47,300
Remote example in person education.

450
00:52:50,500 --> 00:53:04,500
And if you guys want to take that one, I think the first I think we need to realize that there's a there's some on the quality in the world between the people that can remove the work and the people that cannot remote work, and we have to acknowledge that, right?

451
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:12,400
And I am hoping that the remote movement is going to create more human such an environment that everybody else in the work environment can benefit.

452
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:18,900
Now to answer this question directly is there?

453
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:25,100
There's Way to design your, your field work in a way that can be compatible with remote.

454
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:38,700
So anything that requires field presence, you are on the field, we're doing the work everything in, it does not require your field present can be done remotely, but again, this is cannot be your choice as an individual.

455
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:47,900
It has to be a choice of your team of your company to allow that to happen because you don't want to be in a case where you lose productivity or you lose opportunity to progress if you're not in the office.

456
00:53:48,500 --> 00:54:02,700
So anything that can be done without being in this place, in a specific place can be done remotely, but the own field activities has to happen in Jama and person.

457
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:18,400
Yeah, no doubt uses an interesting one because you know if you're building a car and you need it like to go and service this car, that's a Hands-On type of job and there's always going to be times that I think would get really interesting is the knowledge worker side of that.

458
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:29,400
And I think 20 years I mean is there're parts to the job that could be very well be done promote week and there're parts that maybe right now can't and I think it will be interesting ten years from now.

459
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:36,500
I think it's gonna be a lot of change to even how we think about things today because there's we're going to keep evolving and keep changing how we work.

460
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,700
As we move forward.

461
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,600
Let us take the next question from Rebecca.

462
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:49,600
Looks like also interested in culture and how we build culture remotely culture, seems Then Fall to trust and feel.

463
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,100
Feel much more like Consultants.

464
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,600
I think just kind of also Rebecca just to add to this.

465
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:04,100
I saw a lot of chatter and chat about trust and how do we and Chris you talked about we hire for this?

466
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,800
We're hiring somebody, we trust that they can get the job done.

467
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:13,000
How does this play a part in building a remote culture that's built on?

468
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,900
Trust Chris what are you seeing on your side?

469
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,000
As you're building up first base?

470
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:30,800
I don't Love Culture, I often hear like it's always companies, talking about culture, that shouldn't be trying to protect the culture they have.

471
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:48,400
So I think that's like where I would start for I prefer and why speak about is I much prefer to talk about community and how can we hire people that are community and I think the extension of that which Tony mention touched on earlier, is just because we're remote, first doesn't mean that we never spend time.

472
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,600
Together, physically.

473
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:55,700
Like, there're often times that you do want to come together and that does enable you to build those relationships.

474
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:06,000
And I think often actually it's worth acknowledging that in person is better for some things, but when you acknowledge that, you almost have to say, well, how much better?

475
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,100
And it's not 50% better, right?

476
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:15,000
Maybe it's like somewhere between zero and 20% better depending on how much time you spend with someone.

477
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:31,400
But the more time you spend with someone the closer is zero, it gets and you then have this, I guess, matrix by which you can make determinations on, when you should do certain things together to build the community, to build communication to build collaboration skills, No doubt.

478
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:39,300
You know, it's interesting because this coach or thing is it is a term that's thrown around a lot, quite a bit, you know.

479
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:54,200
I think also just if we build the rules on the tools effectively for us to engage in work together, a lot of these things take care of themselves but a lot of times we're been thrown into this world of figure out remote without having that in place.

480
00:56:54,200 --> 00:57:00,100
And we get into this like weird gray area of like, well, I don't see this person online.

481
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:00,500
What is that?

482
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:00,900
It.

483
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:12,800
Well our do you have the proper performance things in place and these are the conversations that lead to this tension oh Mark says I think is very similar to this.

484
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:23,600
How do you keep a remote only Workforce motivated and create trust and absence of physical team, building opportunities and I think?

485
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:30,500
So for us, we're remote team, and then we gather folks for a company on sites.

486
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,000
Periodically.

487
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,800
And that there is nothing.

488
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:45,100
You can replace us breaking bread and happen at meal or engaging in certain activities together that builds more connection.

489
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:59,800
And it's for us personally we are investing in remote first practices and tools and making time for us to connect face-to-face, periodically and the times, and we would connect face-to-face.

490
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:06,700
They're W, we're not talking about work, a lot of the times you were doing things that you don't typically can kick.

491
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:12,000
You can typically handle on video or a phone call, and we have done.

492
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:21,800
We have done that you know last year we do another one this year and that one day that we brought people together just injected this sense of community.

493
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:29,800
Chris back to your point is like the sense of belonging like these are my people and then I am going to climb back on my plane, and I am gonna go live where I live.

494
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,100
But now, I broke bread and strengthen that connection as well with my peers.

495
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,000
Chris Tony.

496
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:49,100
However, you guys looking at team building opportunities in this remote world, Yo, I will start, I think 1st grade question.

497
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:56,100
And you need to have a purpose in your business Beyond just printing money, right?

498
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:04,400
So that's going to create a lot of alignments and Clarity of purpose for the team.

499
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,200
So first is really you have to be clear about your mission and you have to live your mission.

500
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,700
Secondly is you have to listen too.

501
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:13,500
The employee.

502
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,300
So we do employment surveys to place a quarter.

503
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:22,800
The results are taken extremely seriously, they come to me as a CEO, and we talked about them and you should team meeting.

504
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:28,500
And then we plan ahead and communicate back what we're planning.

505
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:40,000
So that, and we have been having engagement in the company of top 2% of all these tobacco companies because you have implemented that constant feedback group of listening.

506
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:40,400
Yeah.

507
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:46,700
And I want to say, In-person meetings are important, but they're not important to get stuff done.

508
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,100
They're important to make you feel the trust.

509
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:55,800
And when we did our first executive in person, team meeting at oyster was November.

510
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:00,400
Last year, was 10 of my 10 people in my team.

511
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,100
One of them came to be, my VP product came to be saying before this meeting.

512
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,500
I knew, I could trust this team.

513
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:11,400
Now I can feel I can trust him to the difference between knowing and feeding.

514
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,700
They're both important.

515
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,900
But you don't need them necessary to.

516
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,100
You don't need to, to meet to get stuff done.

517
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:23,500
We need to meet to know certain things that you can build trust with other people.

518
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,400
It's good, it's good.

519
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Well, look, this brings us to the end of this conversation and now ended their I think it is a good place to end the difference between knowing and feeling around trust with your team, your remote team look at the end of the day, this is an amazing conversation.

520
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:47,100
We're talking about remote work, how is changing the way that we work.

521
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,000
Chris Tony, thank you for being here.

522
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:55,500
Everyone tuning in, thank you for being part of the conversation, and we will see you were Living.

523
01:00:55,700 --> 01:01:01,500
Now in the future of work, we're changing the story from the future of work to the future of living.

524
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,300
Prioritize yourself for start from there.

525
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:11,900
Figure out work around your life, not the other way around guys, thanks again, Chris Tony for joining us everyone for making this event happens.

526
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,100
Have a good week.

527
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,000
See ya, thank you.
