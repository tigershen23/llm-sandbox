Of course, my amazing producer in The Green Room.

16
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,000
You put that right up.

17
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,900
All right, the big question for today.

18
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,400
How comfortable are you with hybrid events?

19
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,000
How many of you would say?

20
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I got this hybrid is life.

21
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,100
It's in my bones.

22
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,100
Are you're comfortable with it or not?

23
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,400
Really?

24
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,000
Sure.

25
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,900
No way not today with hybrid.

26
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay, and not sure sir.

27
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,100
All right.

28
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,300
Well, this is good that you're here because today we have got a packed out agenda.

29
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:21,200
We're going to start off with a Founders greeting, and then we're going to go into some of the key ingredients for engagement.

30
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:29,700
These are the elements that truly make, whether you're in person or whether your virtual, it makes it an engaging event.

31
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:37,400
So we're going to go through those elements and then go into the hybrid production, walkthrough with some of our very own hybrid.

32
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,100
Experts who are helping support our customers today with their hybrid events.

33
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,500
And then we're going to open up it up for interactive QA.

34
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,400
So jumping into some housekeeping notes.

35
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,500
Obviously, you see our chat.

36
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,900
It is lit.

37
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,700
Thank you.

38
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,900
Love seeing the fires and the love and the rocket ships.

39
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,300
Hello.

40
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,100
Alex charlena in the house.

41
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,100
So good to see you all and note that throughout this entire event.

42
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,400
We would love for you to drop your questions.

43
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,100
In QA, so, feel free to the.

44
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,200
You see that tab to the right next to chat.

45
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,900
Just dropping your questions there and feel free to raise your hand at any time.

46
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,600
If you have a question, and we will pull you right up.

47
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,100
Okay.

48
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:31,300
So with that, this is our drumroll moment before we get to the secret sauce of our hybrid events and bring you a little bit under the hood.

49
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,700
We want to invite our Founders to the state.

50
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,400
Here's a warm greeting from Roberto CEO.

51
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,400
And co-founder Jerry president and co-founder and tiger CTO and co-founder.

52
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,900
Harry went.

53
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,900
Thanks so much for being patient with us.

54
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,700
We have had a little bit of audio tweaks here.

55
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,700
And there, you know what, I have actually got our CEO Rob here.

56
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,300
Let us go.

57
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
We're gonna do this.

58
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,200
What's up Gina.

59
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,800
This is the amazing thing about virtualization.

60
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,400
Can't fake.

61
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:57,700
It.

62
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,300
It's real.

63
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:58,800
That's right.

64
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,700
You have to be performed.

65
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,800
We call it second cup.

66
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,400
All right.

67
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,300
The ability to say, you know what, technology will.

68
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,400
So you can kind of time you have to have an idea to enter locksmith go up and The wrong.

69
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,100
That's right.

70
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,400
Yeah.

71
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,200
So we have got a bunch of folks here.

72
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,800
Interesting, learning about hybrid and is here at a little bit more about how you're thinking about it as well.

73
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,200
And what is our students is?

74
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,800
Welcome.

75
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,300
Wait.

76
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:20,700
Okay.

77
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,100
So first of all hybrid, right?

78
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,600
Why are we here?

79
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,700
Why are you guys doing in?

80
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,900
Why do we have an employee here with us today?

81
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:35,200
I think going back to where we are today, even the pandemic, you know that it's a nice world and remote is here today.

82
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,500
The challenge is how do you connect people in a remote world?

83
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,400
How do you do that?

84
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Well, and so we have remote figured out technology.

85
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Enables people to show up on video and have conversations.

86
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,600
But then the challenge becomes how do you do that between two parties?

87
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,300
How do you do that with people that are in office and people that are working from home?

88
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,700
How do you do that?

89
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:01,900
If you're throwing an external experience and folks are tuning in from another country, but they still want to be part of that core experience.

90
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:08,600
You know, it's funny because I was talking to the founders even before we kick off here today and the idea was really around.

91
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,600
You know what?

92
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,300
Our customers are saying and what our customers are actually running into there's some common problems, right?

93
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,400
The biggest challenge is kind of bubbling up to the top.

94
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,000
Number one is known.

95
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,500
How is like, how do I do this?

96
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,200
How do I do this?

97
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:36,100
Well, right, part of it is like, how do I orchestrate this for two audiences, you know if we take a step back, and we look at hybrid and is basic form, its we have people that are in one place in person.

98
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
You have people that are remote.

99
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,300
And these are two parties and you can serve those two parties, really.

100
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,800
Well, right thing by like an NFL game.

101
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,100
There're folks in an arena.

102
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,800
They're having an in-person experience that's phenomenal.

103
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,900
And then you have people in living rooms around the country.

104
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,300
Also, engaging in a remote experience.

105
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,500
The challenge becomes.

106
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,300
How do you merge two universes?

107
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,500
That sounds like a challenge.

108
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,400
It does, it does.

109
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:07,300
And so on of the things we have been, we have been working on that welcome is building the technology that allows folks to drive real time experiences.

110
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,400
And so, Tiger who's our CTO at our company?

111
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,300
It's really about focusing on Building Technology.

112
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
That's built for real-time engagement.

113
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:16,900
Right?

114
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,300
And you look at real-time engagement.

115
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,200
That means rho time down to the second.

116
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:30,800
That means as folks that are sitting in the audience and focuses are at home, should be able to experience down to the second real-time content engagement, that makes sense.

117
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,800
Makes sense.

118
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,100
So it's like, so we do that.

119
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,400
Well, then what?

120
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,400
What else do we baked on top of it?

121
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,800
And that's our engagement layer?

122
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,100
R.

123
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,600
So you get video streaming right audio video, make sure that's real time.

124
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,300
Then there's the question about engagement.

125
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:57,400
Now folks that are sitting in audience and folks that are sitting in a person and remote what happens when they both want to engage at the same time and feed from one another.

126
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
This is where it gets convoluted really quickly.

127
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,400
Turns out that in our audience.

128
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,900
We have a bunch of employees right now on their mobile devices and you're able to engage in real-time.

129
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,100
I am so we can get some chat happening.

130
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,900
We're going to have some chat happening right now.

131
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,700
In real time from our employees from their phone, their listen to us in the audience.

132
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But also our virtual attendees can also engage at the same time, and they can see that happening with remote attendees and in-person attendees, and that's really amazing.

133
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,800
Because if you think about just the different types of personalities and wirings, like I am thinking about introverts versus extroverts.

134
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:47,200
And how, you know, oftentimes, when you're in person Event and all the extroverts get to raise their hand and maybe the squeakiest wheel, but now that there's opportunity to drop those questions.

135
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,100
Even if you're not comfortable going to the Mike and ask you a question.

136
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:58,500
Yeah, I mean talk to us a little bit about you say a lot about Equitable experiences and how technology enables that.

137
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:58,900
Yeah.

138
00:18:59,500 --> 00:18:59,800
Yeah.

139
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,000
I mean you're hitting it rights on the head, right?

140
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Equitable experiences.

141
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,000
In fact that welcome.

142
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,800
We have a Core Company value that speaks to open doors.

143
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,700
And open doors is about providing access, and we can go technology that provides access.

144
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,900
The challenge though becomes going back to how people are wired.

145
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:25,000
Some folks never want to step foot in an office because they were ready, change their lives and their work style.

146
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,100
And said, you know what?

147
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,500
This is my new normal.

148
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,900
I actually changed the way I work and it works really well.

149
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,900
I get to see my kiddos in the morning.

150
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,300
I have flexible hours and I can do this.

151
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,000
I want to stay here.

152
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,400
This is where I am like doing my best work.

153
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,900
Now that person let us say she's living in Alabama, and she's a phenomenal engineer.

154
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:51,900
Sure voice to be as loud as the voice of somebody that's sitting in Palo Alto headquarter.

155
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,800
At that company.

156
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,400
She shouldn't feel disconnected.

157
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,700
She should feel like she's part of that company, part of that experience.

158
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:04,400
And that is, he has a question that is at the same level as the loudest person in the room.

159
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,800
So no more.

160
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:15,700
So me to speak about Equitable experience has no more, is the loudest person in the room because we have technology that enables the best ideas to rise up and level the playing field.

161
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:27,500
So that's the power of like technology, not just for connecting people, but also connecting people and their unique wirings to show up how they are and who they are, right?

162
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
So is great because we have a conversations with amazing customers at welcome.

163
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,300
And the reason why they're investing in welcome and partnering with us is because we enable people to do.

164
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:43,100
Just that to say, you know what, I am a company that is embracing remote and or hybrid.

165
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:56,100
And I want to make sure that my employees Alice of where there are they still feel connected to us as a company and so when somebody submit a question at all hands, That question should be considered should be uploaded.

166
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,800
It should be part of the conversation.

167
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,300
Regardless if that person is tuning in from a little island called Puerto Rico, which is where I live.

168
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,100
They are still part of that core experience.

169
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,900
And that's, that's requires technology.

170
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,800
No doubt, but it also requires the framing and thinking of how to do that.

171
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,600
Well, how do you think knowledge is to enable Echo experience?

172
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:26,100
How do you think technology to empower a sense of belonging and so We talked about, you know, as Founders and I want to step out of your way here soon?

173
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,500
But as Founders, as we look at building, welcome and as technologists, Tech is super important, right?

174
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,400
There's a lot of fundamental things that we need.

175
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,400
But we also need to think about it very differently.

176
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,100
We need to think about it as a service to our people.

177
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,300
We're not just doing events just to do that.

178
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,500
So we're actually Gathering people's time matter.

179
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,300
You mean folks, they are tuning in right now?

180
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,600
Thank you for hanging out with us.

181
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,900
All right, I was about to do so.

182
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,800
Awesome move to keep you entertained while the mic issues being worked out, but that's what it is.

183
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:04,300
It's about, you know, kind of like falling back and say you know what, we're here to connect with people to gather people.

184
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,300
We're going to make sure that their voices are heard and Technology enables at.

185
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
That's so powerful.

186
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,900
I think in its time such as now ever more.

187
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,800
So we need this sense of belonging like you mentioned and human connection.

188
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,900
And the fact that we have technology to leverage to actually bring that sense.

189
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,200
The belonging is super catalytic.

190
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
Yeah, it's very powerful.

191
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,900
So, thank you.

192
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,600
Yeah, no, thanks for having me guys.

193
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,100
Again.

194
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,000
Thanks for being here.

195
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:39,300
I am honored that you give us some of your time, and we had we going to pull back the curtain and show you how to do hybrid, whatever company sighs, you're at whatever, kind of budget you have.

196
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,500
There's a way for you to level the playing field at your company, and we're honored that you're here.

197
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,600
Awesome.

198
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,500
Thanks so much job.

199
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,100
Absolutely.

200
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,000
Great.

201
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,900
Okay, so we're actually going to go right into it and take you under the hood.

202
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,400
With understanding, what are the key components that make hybrid events happen?

203
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,500
So I would love to invite Dylan.

204
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,200
Is there he is.

205
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,000
Hey.

206
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,500
What's going on?

207
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,200
Dylan?

208
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,700
Straight?

209
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,300
It's going great.

210
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,200
Yeah, how are you doing?

211
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,600
Absolutely fantastic.

212
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,400
Ready to dig into all the details of hybrid with you.

213
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,000
Awesome.

214
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,500
All right.

215
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:29,200
Well, what where do I start, you know, can be quite overwhelming to figure out hybrid production.

216
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,300
So Where do I start Dylan, you walk me through?

217
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,000
Yes, you are.

218
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,700
People, you can use this information that we're going to talk about today to be able to run any size of hybrid event.

219
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,900
Whether that's an absolutely large-scale conference down to an internal small company.

220
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,800
All Hands meeting.

221
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
That's awesome.

222
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,000
So what is the goal?

223
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:40,500
The goal of whole hybrid is more talk to our guard where we want to make sure the exact same thing.

224
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,200
We want to be able to make that experience Equitable for everyone.

225
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,800
So, I know most of us in this room, most people watching.

226
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:49,700
Really?

227
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,500
We have all been remote for the past year and a half.

228
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,100
And actually if you guys want to do me a favor real quick, if you all want to hop into chat.

229
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,000
Let me know how long you guys have been remote workers, whether it's just been for the last year and a half and the pandemic.

230
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
If you're going on 5 years, like myself go in their drop how many years?

231
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I see a 30 years remote that someone just dropped in.

232
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,300
I think that's the winner right off the bat.

233
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,700
You will keep throwing those in there.

234
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,500
I would love to see how long that you guys have been remote As we continue talking here, but all of us who have been remote.

235
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,300
We have been kind of going through the same.

236
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,000
Back and forth throughout the past year and a half.

237
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,000
We have got our Bluetooth headphones are pods USB microphones webcams.

238
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,500
Whenever we jump into our meetings, we're choosing which thing we want to be able to used to be able to speak to be out here.

239
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,600
So people can see us.

240
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:49,300
Well, what I am going to do today is break down everything between audio and video that exact same thing to show you that it only takes a few pieces of key equipment and get set up and be able to pull off.

241
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,700
Any type of hybrid event.

242
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:59,700
So, one of the key things to note, hybrid events can be customized to literally do whatever you want.

243
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,800
I mentioned earlier, you can do large.

244
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Absolutely High scale Productions down to the, you know, individual internal All Hands meetings.

245
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,600
So we can be doing stuff.

246
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:19,300
That's just a single camera and a single mic like we were seeing with Gina, or we can do a full panel, have five people on multiple.

247
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:33,900
Multiple microphones different camera angles, you can jump back and forth and be able to do all of those different things, but we're going to get over all the individual pieces for this setup so that you can see how simple hybrid can be.

248
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,100
So, a high level of what we're going to be going over.

249
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,400
Today.

250
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,300
We have two sections.

251
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:48,400
Like I said, audio and video your main three pieces of audio equipment that you're going to need your microphones, your audio mixer / interface.

252
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,700
And you're in person speakers.

253
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,400
For video, you're going to need your cameras and a video.

254
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:55,900
Switcher.

255
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,000
These are some extra pieces of equipment.

256
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
What we are doing for our event today.

257
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,800
We have multiple people speaking.

258
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,500
We have a couple different camera angles.

259
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,700
So we're kind of going for that higher level of production.

260
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,800
There going to be a couple extra pieces in here.

261
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:15,200
Erics do to be able to bring this down in budget and inside, whatever is going to customize and work for you guys.

262
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,300
So, with that being said, let us jump right into our audio overview, so Step 1 microphones.

263
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,700
The Easiest step.

264
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,100
What a microphones.

265
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,900
Do they pick up your voice?

266
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,800
They make sure everybody can hear you both in-person.

267
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,000
My team here and virtually everybody who is watching right?

268
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,300
Now.

269
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,800
These are there are two major types of microphones that you guys can grab.

270
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,200
We have got the wireless ones.

271
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
Like I am using, you have the ones that plug right in.

272
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,500
There're tons of different options that you can choose from, but the main job of your microphone is to pick up the presenters voice so that everybody can hear you.

273
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,200
This takes us into step to your audio mixer and your interface.

274
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,200
This piece of equipment right here.

275
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,700
Is your critical piece of equipment to make sure that everything is coming together.

276
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's going to be doing two major jobs for you during a hybrid event.

277
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:18,600
First, the job of the mixer, each microphone is going to be plugged into an individual channel in the mixer and that way you can control your presenters volume.

278
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,900
So if you have someone who speaks very quietly are soft, they're microphone away very easy to be able to turn them up.

279
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,300
Someone whose super loud since to project their voice a lot like myself.

280
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,600
You got to watch that and be able to pull them back down.

281
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,800
So that's the first job.

282
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,500
The mixer.

283
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,200
The second is the interface.

284
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:42,200
This is where we get into some more of the nitty-gritty details, but I am going to break it down and make it super simple for everybody.

285
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,500
So, the interface is doing two major things here.

286
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:56,000
The first thing it's doing is taking all of this live audio everything that I am saying for every One who's sitting in this room, and it's bringing it into the welcome platform.

287
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,400
So that everyone who is virtual, can hear what I am saying?

288
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,500
The second job of the interface is to take everyone who is virtual just like Gina was earlier.

289
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,800
Take everybody virtual all the videos that you're playing through.

290
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:17,300
Welcome the music, any other virtual presenters that you have and be able to make sure that they can be heard in your in-person audience as well.

291
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,700
Why is this so critical?

292
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:27,100
This helps remove two of the major issues with hybrid first?

293
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:33,200
It's going to allow your in person and your virtual attendees for have the exact same experience when it comes to audio.

294
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,500
Everyone in person.

295
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,600
Everyone virtual is going to be able to hear and experience the exact same thing.

296
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,900
And second.

297
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,400
It's going to move feedback.

298
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:47,200
There's one of the biggest problems that people run into when they're trying to do hybrid of its how do you talk to someone?

299
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,300
Who's remote, how you have that back and forth?

300
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:56,200
Conversation without there being feedback mixer and that interface is that keep peace.

301
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,700
That completely removes the problem of feedback without that set up.

302
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,700
None of this would be possible, and we're talking from the large conference events.

303
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:10,900
Like I was saying earlier, you can have five panelists up here, talking someone in New York someone in San Francisco.

304
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,600
People here in Las Vegas.

305
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:18,300
They can all be having a conversation back and forth and that's possible because of your audio interface.

306
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,600
In step three is your speaker's, the in-person audio.

307
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,600
So the audio interface everything that's coming out of welcome.

308
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,800
You plug those right into the speakers in your room, whether they're on the side up in the ceiling.

309
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,400
If you guys are doing it in a hotel, that's going to make sure that your in-person audience hears everything that's going on.

310
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,100
So that's it for audio.

311
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,700
That was a lot of information.

312
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,400
Don't worry.

313
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,500
We're going to be sending some stuff for you guys afterwards.

314
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,400
So don't worry.

315
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,300
We got some notes.

316
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,700
We're going to jump into video, Step One is our cameras.

317
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,700
We have, you guys are all familiar with sing camera setup.

318
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,800
That's what we have been doing for the past year and a half.

319
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,200
You have your face time cameras built into your computer.

320
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,500
So you might have a USB webcam.

321
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,700
You guys use this on a daily basis.

322
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,700
It's super simple plugs right in.

323
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,500
In easy to use in hybrid events.

324
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,300
However, you're more than likely going to want to be able to show multiple camera angles and multiple views.

325
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,900
You may want to show more of a close up like after seeing right now.

326
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,400
We may want a wide shot showing the entire stage.

327
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:29,300
If you had a lot of panelists, you may want to get super fancy and have someone on one of the moving camera panning across your audience.

328
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:37,100
All that you need to be able to do that is people to man your cameras and make sure that they have an HDMI output and you're good to go.

329
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,700
Now.

330
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,700
I say that, but you guys are thinking when I plug this stuff into my computer, just one camera.

331
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,100
How do I take five or six different video feeds and put them into one?

332
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,300
That's our second piece of equipment.

333
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,800
Here are Step 2 under video.

334
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,200
The video switcher.

335
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,100
What?

336
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,600
This is going to do is take all of those video feeds from all of you're different.

337
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:06,400
Cameras, put them into one piece of equipment and then you are going to be able to choose what you want your audience to see.

338
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,800
So, while I am up here on stage speaking, if we had a different setup.

339
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,500
We could be panning across our audience, to see everybody watching right now.

340
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,600
It's just a click of a button and everybody's going to be able to see that exact same view.

341
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,400
So you can focus on your speaker's, your audience.

342
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,300
You can create the experience that you want to Via the video switcher.

343
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,500
So it makes it incredibly simple for you to show your in person.

344
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,000
Virtual audience, the exact same thing.

345
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,100
And one last thing to note just kind of natural piece.

346
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,500
Here is what you're in personal finances.

347
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,400
Seeing up mentioned that a couple times.

348
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:47,400
One of the easiest ways to do this and what we are actually doing right now, is we have one set up in our attendee view.

349
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:53,700
So everything that you guys are currently seeing that, our virtual attendees everybody in our room is seeing exact same thing.

350
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,600
So, everybody's talking in chat.

351
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,400
We have got QA, we have our poles.

352
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,500
We're going that back in.

353
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:06,800
Fourth, all you have to do is plug that into your live video feeds, so then everybody can be engaging in the exact same way.

354
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,900
Now the final step bringing it all together.

355
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,400
Bring it in for a landing.

356
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,100
How do we get it all into?

357
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,600
Welcome.

358
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,100
How do you do that?

359
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,200
We're talking all these different pieces of equipment.

360
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:37,000
There has to be a ton of extra work to be able to do this, and I am actually really excited to say it's the exact same process as choosing your are pods or choosing a webcam to be able to put in when you jump into the welcome platform, when you're in your producer View and you are adding feeds into the Green Room.

361
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,400
Drop down menu, pops up.

362
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,000
All you're going to choose is those specific video.

363
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,900
Switcher and your audio interface that's going to grab everything that's happening for your in-person audience and be able to put that virtual.

364
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,200
So an everyone is seeing the exact same thing.

365
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,200
So wasn't out high-level overview, and don't worry.

366
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,800
Like I said earlier, we're going to be sending this out to everybody.

367
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,800
So we got you.

368
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:12,800
Audio, you got your microphones that plug into your audio mixer and the interface, which plugs into welcome.

369
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,300
It's bringing all of your audio into welcome for your video.

370
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,900
You have got your camera's, plug it into your video switchers, which are going right into welcome.

371
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,900
And then, on that audio side, everything that's happening in.

372
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,300
Welcome is what's going to be coming out for your in-person audio?

373
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:35,000
And then same thing that video feed, everything that you guys are watching right now, is what we are going to be bringing.

374
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,800
Out for the in-person video.

375
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,199
And that's just about everything that you need to know Gina.

376
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,300
Let me toss it back over to you.

377
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,600
I want to hear your thoughts.

378
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
I just talked for way too long.

379
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,900
What do you get for me?

380
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,400
Does that all make sense?

381
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,000
Where are we?

382
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,300
Hey Dylan, thank you so much.

383
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:00,900
I am going to actually bring you back on stage with me because there's there're some questions coming in.

384
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:10,200
I mean you're a whiz, you have got this dialed in, and we definitely want to share out that diagram to all those who are attending.

385
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,900
Today.

386
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,000
You're already getting some questions.

387
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,400
So let us go ahead and answer Jaclyn's question here.

388
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,400
So are there particular audio interfaces that you'd recommend?

389
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,100
Yes, that is a fantastic question.

390
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,300
If you go and you just Google search, this, you're going to get tons and tons of results.

391
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,500
There are two brands that after doing live and audio events for probably about ten plus years.

392
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:45,500
Now, the easiest way to be able to get this set up for you, a company called Behringer and a company called Allen & Heath.

393
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,500
Both of those have your audio interfaces and the mixers.

394
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,000
They're built into one machine.

395
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,500
It's going to make it super simple.

396
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,300
It is quite literally.

397
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,300
Lee the most plug-and-play that you can get, so Google search.

398
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,400
Those going to solve all your problems?

399
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,800
Awesome.

400
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,100
Okay.

401
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:07,300
Here's another question that I think you can help us answer, Dylan from Jacob Castro.

402
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,200
How much does setting something like this up cost?

403
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,700
Say one that would require two cameras and two microphones with audio interfaces.

404
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,800
Yeah, Jacob.

405
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,200
That is a great question.

406
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,000
The nice thing about this is it all depends on the level of production, that you And to do.

407
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:30,000
So we're talking two cameras to microphones the audio interface, essentially the same setup that we have right now.

408
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:42,700
If your budget buying, we do this for $1,500, if you really wanted to, if you want to get super fancy with the cameras and the microphones and everything else that you're using honestly sky's the limit.

409
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:51,900
But to be quite Frank, probably $1,500 to five grand range, anything that probably going above and beyond what you need somewhere within that range.

410
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,100
You're gonna be able to find everything.

411
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,700
I mean, Dylan just keeping a real what's are set up.

412
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:02,400
Like if you were to describe what we have got here, with our Audio video.

413
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,300
And what's the guesstimation of cost?

414
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,300
For what?

415
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,900
We're how we have pulled this off?

416
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,300
Yeah, that's a great question.

417
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:15,500
So, we have a couple different microphones that we have set up that were using, they're all Wireless, which those tend to be a little bit pricier.

418
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,500
And we have a couple different camera angles set up that we're capturing everything from as well.

419
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,800
So I think we're doing a three or four camera setups.

420
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,800
We have got the videos watching.

421
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,800
We have our audio interface, and then we have three different microphones that were using as well.

422
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,600
Well, there's a couple other pieces, we're talking cables and stuff like that.

423
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:40,100
But for the most part our total cost came in just over five thousand dollars to be able to do this full set up.

424
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,600
Gotcha, that's good.

425
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,600
And then what are you seeing these days with our customers?

426
00:37:49,600 --> 00:38:04,200
I know we have got a range of hybrid event use cases, but generally what would you recommend for, you know, a set up a 500 attendees like could what we have today work for 500 attendees.

427
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,200
5,000 attendees, you know, you have to upgrade equipment at that point.

428
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,600
It was a very good question.

429
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,700
So to be completely honest with you, these types of things.

430
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:24,000
I always like to take it on a case-by-case basis because it's going to depend on the level of production, do the people on your team, have any experience with audio and video.

431
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,800
Is it easier for you to just hire a production company and then welcome teaches them how to plug everything in like.

432
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,600
I just did, there's a number of different options there.

433
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,700
But to answer your question, our set up those key pieces, that video switcher.

434
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,700
And your audio interface.

435
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,700
Are you can use that for a room with 500 people or with room of 5,000 people?

436
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,200
Like I said, if you have good pieces of equipment, for those two specific things, you can make anything happen.

437
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,500
The sky is really the limit.

438
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,400
No.

439
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,700
Alright, Tyson young has a question.

440
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,600
Is there a fall back?

441
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,000
When things go wrong?

442
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,000
Yes.

443
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,800
It happened earlier, you got to get creative.

444
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,800
If you can't get creative when you're doing your events.

445
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,700
If you want everything to go, right?

446
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,800
I am sorry, you're going to be stressed out all the time.

447
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,200
That's just, it's just the way life is fall back.

448
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:25,600
What I always do by W amount of equipment that you need, when we're talking cables by good stuff, cables break.

449
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,400
So easily.

450
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,900
Think of your phone charger tossing that thing on the side of your bed, traveling with that, they break because they're really cheaply made get the really thick.

451
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,400
Solid ones and you're going to have that thing for five six years.

452
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,700
Hire out people, if you're not confident in a skills, if you want to learn tons of resources, we can teach you.

453
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,500
We can walk you through step-by-step.

454
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,400
If you want to alleviate the stress of everything.

455
00:39:49,400 --> 00:40:02,300
From the production side, higher production company come to us, teach them how to put everything together, but the fallback be ready to be creative, be prepared for things to go wrong and by double the amount that you need.

456
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,700
That's great.

457
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,700
Okay, I am going to take one more question here.

458
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,100
Let us see.

459
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,800
Andrew is asking what does it look like at the venue?

460
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,400
What does what I got the venue.

461
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,000
Do we have our amazing video guy Faulkner?

462
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,200
Do we have any views of our room right now?

463
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
That's a no case.

464
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,500
Everyone was running.

465
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,600
There's a wall, beautiful wall.

466
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,600
Nice, wall right there.

467
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:38,700
Okay, we view that we have got But to answer your question, kind of what we have on our walk you here.

468
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,000
Because Gina and I are both up here.

469
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,400
I am kind of cutting a little bit.

470
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,900
We have got both of our banners on either side of me, right?

471
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,300
Outside of both of those.

472
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,300
We have our screens so that everybody in audience.

473
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,500
Can see chat queue, a, the polls, everything else that's going on.

474
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,600
We have a couple of what we call confidence monitors.

475
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,700
So as I am looking into this camera right here?

476
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,500
I have another TV screen right underneath.

477
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,100
So I See, Gina and be talking directly to her.

478
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,600
I have got a team right here on my left running all of our audio and video needs.

479
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,100
And I have got a bunch of other people walking around making sure that I am staying on time and talking about everything that I need to talk about.

480
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:18,700
Awesome.

481
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:26,900
Thank you for describing all that Dylan and just being awesome at walking us through all things hybrid event under the hood.

482
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,800
Please continue to just drop your questions.

483
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,000
We would love to maybe answer some at the end.

484
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:41,100
I would like to transition now into some five key ingredients of what makes an engaging event.

485
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
So, thank you, Dylan.

486
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:52,900
Dylan walked us through some of the production elements of Together a hybrid event thinking about the in person as well as the virtual.

487
00:41:53,100 --> 00:42:04,700
And so we're going to quickly go through these five ingredients of Engagement that you can consider as your hosting both the virtual and the in-person side of your event.

488
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,400
So, I will go through that.

489
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,800
In the meantime, continue to drop your questions.

490
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,400
We can bring Dylan back up and even Roberto back up to answer any of your questions.

491
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,700
So here we go.

492
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,000
Five ingredients and of Engagement.

493
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Well, they look like this.

494
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:28,600
It's there's set the tone engagement to be considering that strategically transitions networking and speaker experience.

495
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:47,000
So going through those elements, you know, when you have engagement you truly have this experience and all of these elements that were describing actually help connect your physical attendees with your virtual and attendees so that you create this one shared experience.

496
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,500
So setting the tone, let us start with that, you know, engagement.

497
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,300
It's not just a chat.

498
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,500
It's not just that networking or any of these other places.

499
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,600
It really starts at the top.

500
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,900
It starts at the beginning.

501
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,100
And so the intro we believe is one of the most important.

502
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,400
It's like no matter what.

503
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,000
Let us say, like, we had some audio glitches earlier, right?

504
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,000
These things happen.

505
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,900
So it's really important to set that positive tone of your event from the very GetGo.

506
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:24,200
Continue to thread line the same level of energy and excitement through your entire event because you don't know.

507
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,600
There could be some things that go wrong in Virtual and hybrid.

508
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:34,600
But this is part of the beauty of Live Events and part of the beauty of this is human.

509
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,600
It's real.

510
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,600
So, going into it.

511
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:50,200
There's some other components that help you set the tone, and we have got here, you know, at the top video countdown clocks were your countdown up until your Event actually starts height videos.

512
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,600
This is where you can use royalty free videos.

513
00:43:53,600 --> 00:44:01,900
If you got a public audience and audio as well, or if it's a journal, then you can use, you know, music of your choice video of your choice.

514
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:08,300
You want to make sure you have an MC and a facilitator, that's thread, lining your entire event.

515
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:16,400
We have got sound effects and also housekeeping that we did at the beginning, which was also really important.

516
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,000
Now the Second ingredient is engagement, and this is what everybody's talking about today.

517
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,000
How do we solve for this problem?

518
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
But both for our virtual audience, our in-person audience and keep it consistent.

519
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:34,100
A lot of it is in intentional intentionality and thinking through your run of show.

520
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,400
But there's also some features and welcome that really support engagement in a powerful way.

521
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:53,600
Now, of course, we have got chat and there and then there's interactive QA where you can actually have people After questions bring him on stage and have a dynamic conversation with those who are asking their questions.

522
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,700
Pulls like we did at the top.

523
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,200
We asked your sentiment on your comfort levels around hybrid.

524
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:08,000
And so at any given time what's great is, we can make quick adjustments to these questions and put up any kind of pole.

525
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,500
So those elements definitely help.

526
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:21,000
Now, the third ingredient is transitions, It's can be magical if you're intentional about them.

527
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,500
It's often an overlooked thing to be like, okay.

528
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,900
Well, we know this is the main part of the content.

529
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:45,000
And here, here, but thread lightning, all of those chunks of content throughout your segment with seamless and the right transitions can really Elevate the engagement and your brand experience virtually and in person in a powerful way.

530
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,400
So how do you do that?

531
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:54,300
I mean, you have got Obviously your MC facilitator, that's continuing to threaten line, no matter what happens with the event and whichever direction it goes.

532
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,800
They thread line.

533
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:08,100
That energy the sentiment they provide direction for your audience and you they can the audience can navigate accordingly and this works obviously for in-person or virtual our media and overlays.

534
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:15,600
So being able to quickly put up videos audio and then put up overlays right now in The Green Room.

535
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,900
I have got our producer.

536
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,600
Linda helping me out.

537
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:30,000
Just putting up these overlays and this creates for a much more engaging experience and also for transitions from Dylan segment to my segment.

538
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,400
So on and so forth.

539
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,800
And of course the pools feature.

540
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,500
Those can serve as a great tool of transition when you want to go from topic to topic section to section.

541
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,600
The fourth element is networking.

542
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,300
So we hear this.

543
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,900
We see, we see this in person.

544
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,100
We see this virtually as well and you know in welcome, we have got breakouts.

545
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,400
We have also got lounges the differences breakouts.

546
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:03,900
There is a pull so virtually you can automatically pull people into different breakout rooms or in person.

547
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:09,900
You have assigned specific workshops or rooms that have topics of discussion.

548
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:17,000
So breakout serve as a pull, whereas lounges or exhibit Halls, have a push experience.

549
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:26,000
And so in the in-person experience, that would look like an exhibit hall, where you have got branded Booth space and Banners and swag.

550
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,500
You got your lead generation trackers, and you have got a point of contact, a warm face.

551
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:35,500
That's willing to walk the, the guests through the brand experience of that.

552
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,000
Boot.

553
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,600
Same thing can happen virtually as well.

554
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,000
In welcome.

555
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,500
We have got a branded sponsored experience.

556
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,900
Where you can have a point of personal point of contact.

557
00:47:47,100 --> 00:48:01,800
Who is actually welcoming every single person coming in have call to action links, you know, any downloadables, any kind of prizes are gifts that, you want to do trivia, all that can be done in our breakout and Lounge experience.

558
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:09,900
And of course, having a facilitator, I think is really key in any of the networking experiences to be very effective.

559
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,000
You want somebody?

560
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:18,100
That is the representative of your brand and, you know, I think these are some of the small things That get overlooked.

561
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,200
You want to get the right energy?

562
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,100
The right personality and have your call to actions, your swag.

563
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,400
Whatever it is that you're giving away.

564
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,500
Ready in that networking experience.

565
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,100
Now, finally, it's the speaker experience.

566
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:37,400
I believe it can make or break a 360 experience of an event.

567
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,300
And so, you know, we have talked a lot about the attendee experience.

568
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:46,800
We have talked a lot about the producer side of putting a hybrid event together.

569
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,200
Either.

570
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:58,400
And now when you think about your speaker's, you want them to have just as much of a meaningful experience as your attendees and your producers.

571
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:04,200
And so, you know, in welcome, we have actually got a green room and it's right beneath the screen.

572
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:11,200
I can actually see my producer Linda and all the other folks that are within our Green Room.

573
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,900
Hello, and, you know, just like an in-person breeder, right?

574
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,900
As a speaker.

575
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,500
Just about to go onto stage.

576
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I have got nerves.

577
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,600
And so being able to be in a green room environment where I can calm down.

578
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,900
I have got my speaker, check my mic checks right?

579
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:35,500
Visual checks, and I have got a warm face in the green room from the producer.

580
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,600
That's calming me down as a speaker.

581
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:51,500
So not only do I have that experience before I go on stage, but there's also a countdown clock that's keeping me on time because for me, I mean, am I countdown clock is giving me the ten minutes signal right now, right?

582
00:49:51,500 --> 00:50:02,900
So it's very helpful for speakers to be able to see those that time check, especially if they have a tendency to go over and then finally, The Green Room chat.

583
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,100
This is an exclusive chat.

584
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:09,400
That is only between the speakers and the producers.

585
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,900
So those in public.

586
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,400
Cannot see the speaker experience.

587
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,600
So there you go.

588
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,600
Those are the five key elements.

589
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,000
We went.

590
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,100
Then pretty quickly.

591
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:40,500
It's setting the tone supercritical of making or breaking that event and how the pacing in the feel, the energy goes, and then the engagement transitions networking and a speaker experience, which gives you this 360 experience that you could be considering when you're putting your hybrid events together, both in-person and virtual.

592
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,500
All right.

593
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,900
So we have got about 10 minutes left, and we still have some questions.

594
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,900
Can I invite?

595
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,600
Right, Rob and Dylan to the stage to wrap this up with our final questions here?

596
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,600
All right.

597
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,300
Two, three.

598
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,000
All right.

599
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,800
That's my bad.

600
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,600
Blame it on me.

601
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,500
I am the guy with the mic.

602
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,400
I didn't the button.

603
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:38,900
There.

604
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,500
It is.

605
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:44,800
That's part of the stays at, doesn't know how to use a mic.

606
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,000
So that's as part of the challenge, as well as events.

607
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,000
But Gina, thanks so much for 14, it up.

608
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,500
Great questions from the audience already.

609
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
One of the things I was talking about is things will go wrong.

610
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,200
You have to be creative, be able to fit it.

611
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,100
Have this technology.

612
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,000
You need to get people on your team.

613
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,300
They're not going to freak out and shut it down.

614
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,900
The mic is not working.

615
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,600
And sometimes, it's as simple as clicking a button on the microphone to make sure that it's on.

616
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:15,700
So, anyway, dear.

617
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,400
What questions?

618
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,500
Do we have teed up here.

619
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,800
I will do my best here to answer.

620
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,300
All right, we have got a question from Gordon.

621
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:29,900
Are you going to be showing under the hood with the welcome interface itself?

622
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,400
Okay, Gordon, great question.

623
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,600
Couple things here.

624
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,600
Like, what is the go?

625
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,200
Why do we do this event to begin with?

626
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,300
We did the show you behind the scenes?

627
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,600
We are actually the team has diagrams and follow content.

628
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,300
They will be in touch with you on.

629
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:53,100
It's going to show you all the things on which plugs and how to do this and which cameras and what bud you have to get and hybrid event on.

630
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,700
And yeah, so we will be opening it up during this event.

631
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,900
We are not going to flip the screen over and show you the Green Room.

632
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:04,000
Use our website, you start to see some of that book a demo.

633
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:12,800
If you want to see The Green Room live and in person and see how that works, but we will be following up with more content enables you to understand all the ins and outs.

634
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,300
All right.

635
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,100
Next question from charlena.

636
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,700
How many people do you need to run a hybrid event?

637
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,900
Good question, you know, this is an interesting one.

638
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:30,500
I think you can get pretty creative with running a slim team.

639
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,200
And empowering them to do a little bit of things in doing really, really well.

640
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:40,800
I think about hybrid is connecting an in-person audience and a remote audience together.

641
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:55,400
I think should have on your squad at least three people as I think about using a platform driving moderation of Engagement with in chat and making sure somebody in the producer seat that can keep the show going.

642
00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:01,300
I think one of the things Whitney's is has a ton of experience doing this as well as an Of ours.

643
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:06,200
She's recommending anywhere from three to five people, depending on that experience.

644
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,400
And I would agree with that.

645
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,700
I think you can get a really Stellar experience with a crew.

646
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:18,500
That's equipped to be creative and knows, I know how to use technology and know-how to turn on microphones as part of that.

647
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,600
All right, we have got another question here from an.

648
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,900
Is there a live audience at the location?

649
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,300
As it would be an actual hybrid event.

650
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,900
Is there a live audience right here?

651
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,100
Yes.

652
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:33,900
This hears it up.

653
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,600
Here is a live audience here.

654
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,300
Let us go.

655
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,500
Let us go.

656
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,600
Alright.

657
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,100
Alright guys, there is a live audience here.

658
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:59,100
One of the things I don't think it was here earlier was there we all equipped with a mobile companion while they're actually engaging live.

659
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,700
Now, sit with that for a second.

660
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,800
One of the things that we have been working on.

661
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,100
Welcome.

662
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:08,000
It's really understanding like what are the Dynamics of people gathering in person?

663
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,600
And from one of these is a small thing, but it's very important.

664
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:21,000
It's never somebody sitting in the Location are typically just hearing a one-way communication, hearing the person on stage with a microphone and a message.

665
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,500
And they're Translating that's a perception being received.

666
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,000
When you are in remote environment.

667
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,600
There's a two-way communication.

668
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:35,900
There's a person on stage but it's also the body of people having a narrative around the information that's being delivered.

669
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:49,800
And every attendee in that experience is actually walking away with the perception of both the speaker voice and also the Collective voice of the people and that's the perception they walk away with when you're sitting in person.

670
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,000
And you can't connect and here and engage with the other 500, people that are remote.

671
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:00,000
It misses that rich conversation that you can walk away with.

672
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,100
And so hybrid done.

673
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:09,900
Well, enables those confirmations those conversations to flow in a way that you walk away with that perspective regardless of your person of your environment.

674
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,100
So, yes, we have real people sitting in seats here in Las Vegas.

675
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,400
Do you have another question?

676
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,200
Yes, we do.

677
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:17,800
Okay.

678
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,500
Another question from Gordon.

679
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Is there a recording of this event that is able to be shared post-event?

680
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:24,900
Absolutely.

681
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,700
That's a good question.

682
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:32,000
I think that yes, we can recordings and Snippets are gone here guys and I will talk to him about this.

683
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:37,200
Basically open up the hood and Empower you guys to throw hybrid experiences.

684
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,800
So we want to be as open as possible sheer documentation.

685
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,400
Share video, shared diagrams share even like Hardware.

686
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:45,400
Ends.

687
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,500
So you can go and do these events yourself.

688
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:53,000
So, yes, look for posts emails from our team that will follow up with these resources.

689
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,100
Awesome, and we have got one last question here from cell.

690
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,900
How does the live audience engaged without a laptop?

691
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,500
Since a platform requires Google Chrome on a machine for these features?

692
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Well, there it is.

693
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:10,700
It's called.

694
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,000
Welcome, ha.

695
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,300
We are teams working.

696
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:18,800
Relentlessly around the clock to enable you to tune in from any device that you have.

697
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:19,600
Right?

698
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,900
So if you're in person and all you have is your phone, that's all you really need.

699
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:23,700
Typically.

700
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,900
When you host an experience people are on their phones.

701
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:33,500
Anyway, you might as well use that phone and bring that experience to not just a remote but improve the experience across the board.

702
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,600
So, yeah, all you need is really your phone.

703
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,300
We're working on, it's working today.

704
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:38,700
We will be reviewing.

705
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:45,800
And that here, shortly that empowers everybody in the audience, regardless of where they locate it to engage in the equal playing field.

706
00:57:45,800 --> 00:58:00,000
Meaning that if someone has a question in there saying, Alabama, Her voice is heard just as loud as the person jumping behind this room trying to get a hold of the mic and that's the power of hybrid as power of using technology to connect people.

707
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,100
We question.

708
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,000
That's awesome, Rob.

709
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,600
Well, we're coming to our time here, where we're going to wrap up.

00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,200

Okay.

30
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:41,500
So before we jump into some tacos and margaritas, let us do a quick poll.

31
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
All right, so Linda in our Green Room, I can see her.

32
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Maybe y'all can't see her but I see you.

33
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:47,900
Linda.

34
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,200
Do you mind putting that pole?

35
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,000
There we go.

36
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,800
Have you cooked with a virtual Chef before?

37
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,100
If yes, today's my first time drop in your votes.

38

00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:07,400
This is your first time, so, oh, we got some other folks who have done this before.

40
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
All right.

41
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,200
Okay.

42
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,900
Well great.

43
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,200
We have got a packed out agenda, an amazing Chef that I see in the Green Room Chef Giovanni who I will introduce shortly.

44
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,700
Let us pull up that agenda here.

45
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,100
So today what we're going.

46
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,900
Do is we will also introduce you to the chef.

47
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
We will start with our cocktails mocktails, then we will go through the overview of tools.

48
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Protein prep, do a taco.

49
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,900
Check in with one another garnish tortilla prep.

50
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,800
And then we will do the Tocco assembly.

51
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,400
Have the party at the end, final remarks.

52
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,500
And then there's going to be a photo winning up.

53
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,700
So be sure to take those photos, and we're going to share it with one another.

54
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,200
Now with that.

55
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:58,300
I would love to introduce the chef, he has worked in the Austin restaurant scene for over 10 years.

56
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,700
He's made relationships with some of the most popular restaurant groups in Austin.

57
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:09,800
On, if you're from Austin, you would know these names Bryce Gilmore, Mark, bewley Sam, Hillman Mass.

58
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,900
These are really big chefs out there.

59
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:16,099
So Chef Philip Speer who runs assembly.

60
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:30,900
And he's had four nominations with the James Beard Foundation hired, Chef Giovanni to come to become a key member of the His kitchen management team and their chef Giovanni serves as the sous chef for the Commodore.

61
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:38,200
And this is allowed him to expand his knowledge and his skills within modern Mexican Cuisine.

62
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:45,600
And so now, he operates as the executive chef at assembly kitchen leading the team with menu creation and talent screening.

63
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,900
So with that Chef Giovanni.

64
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,400
Join me on stage.

65
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,600
Hello.

66
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,700
Taco Tuesday.

67
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah.

68
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Yes, I am excited.

69
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,500
Hola como estas.

70
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,800
Hi, muy.

71
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,900
Bien, muy Brent.

72
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,300
Yeah, super excited, Taco Tuesday, officially today.

73
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,500
We're going to have a great time.

74
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
We're going to eat some really delicious food and enjoy each other's company.

75
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,400
So let us do it.

76
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,500
Perfect.

77
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,100
Well, I think especially the best way to start off.

78
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,800
Taco Tuesday is with a God, dang, Margarita.

79
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,200
So let us get right into it.

80
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,400
Right?

81
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,300
Y'all, I would like to mention.

82
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,100
If you have any questions whatsoever.

83
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,600
Unfortunately, I am not able to see you guys on my end of the screen.

84
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,000
But please throw those questions right in the chat.

85
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,200
I can see it on the right of my monitor, and we can definitely get you, those answers, right?

86
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,200
So, the best thing about this Margarita is that it's going to be ready in 30.

87
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,500
Against.

88
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,100
All right.

89
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:59,500
So all the items we will need for this Margarita as follows here, when Empty Glass, beautiful lime, our Margarita mixture here and I just have this little plate with my lime salt in it.

90
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,100
Alright.

91
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
So here we go, guys.

92
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,500
This is a quick trick.

93
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,700
First thing I am going to do is, let us go ahead and cut this line right down the middle.

94
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:13,400
Like so, Then we're going to go ahead and grab a little wedge from this lime.

95
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,900
Slice it in the middle.

96
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:24,500
Just going to score it, allowing us to place it over our glass and really Rim it with this fresh lime juice.

97
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,400
More flavor from here.

98
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,300
We're just going to tip it right onto that glass.

99
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,200
Sorry for the scratchy's sounds not pleasant.

100
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,700
But here we go.

101
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,700
Fill it up with ice like that.

102
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,900
Beautiful.

103
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,200
Good healthy, Shake.

104
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,000
Everybody get that.

105
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,400
Taco dance already started.

106
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,300
This is where we're getting that move-in ready.

107
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
Getting ready for it.

108
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,500
Pop, the cap.

109
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,900
Fill her up extra.

110
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,000
Squeeze of lime.

111
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,400
Quick Trick, there we go, guys.

112
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,200
Beautiful.

113
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,100
Margarita right in front of you.

114
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,700
Cheers y'all.

115
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,200
Beautiful.

116
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,800
How's it tasting?

117
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,600
Everyone like the margarita?

118
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,800
Cheers, I love the chairs.

119
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Perfect.

120
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,200
Super Fresh lime juice, is exactly what makes this Margarita, really pop?

121
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,500
I like a little strawberry floater on my margarita.

122
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,600
Someone asked do we like floaters here in Austin, Texas?

123
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,100
That's a hell.

124
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,600
Yes.

125
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,500
So beautiful.

126
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,900
So now that we got our drink settled in front of us.

127
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,500
We can finally get to relax, you know, get our drinking on, it's only makes us better chefs and the end of it.

128
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,400
I think it's also going to make us a little more confident.

129
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,600
So when we are cooking these tacos, everything is pre cooked for you.

130
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,500
We're really just looking to get those garnishes on the plate.

131
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,400
We're looking to heat up this meat or vegetables depending on the kit you get.

132
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,200
And then so it's really simple trick.

133
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,300
We got our super nice tacos.

134
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,300
It's going to feed a lot of people.

135
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,200
Tonight.

136
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,200
So if you have anyone in your house with you, please tag them along and let us get on with the show.

137
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600
So we got our drink out of the way, right?

138
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,200
Let us go ahead and talk about utensils and tools.

139
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,200
Okay, super, super simple.

140
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,200
The most things we were going to be needing is actually pans, right?

141
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,600
Because we have got three proteins.

142
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,300
We got a Carnitas, we have chicken tinga, and we have our Koji marinated skirt steak.

143
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,200
If you did get the vegetarian, you're going to have our much.

144
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,000
Shroom mixture, some miso carrots, and also a butternut squash to saute.

145
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,400
Super, super simple.

146
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,700
So like I said, it's going to be a majority of pans.

147
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,800
But let us go ahead and talk about utensils.

148
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,000
Got our chef knife, right.

149
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Beautiful cutting board, of course, and then just now near me.

150
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,000
I have a little spatula.

151
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,600
Definitely going to need that for our homemade tortillas.

152
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,000
I love to have these little tongues as well.

153
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,000
And then I just have a small amount of spoons here.

154
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:23,500
Is it going to help with pulling out any ingredients out of those packaging and just kind of make our life a little easier when we're saucing when we're putting some, you know, Salsas and ramekins, super simple.

155
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,600
Of course.

156
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,800
I have a couple Linens as well.

157
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Now you guys, if you don't have a tortilla holder too warm to keep our tortillas nice and warm.

158
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,600
While we're eating our tacos.

159
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,600
The linen will definitely work as the trick, right?

160
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,700
We're going to use It as a steamer once we have our hot tortillas.

161
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,400
So make sure you at least have an extra clean linen.

162
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,000
Alongside.

163
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,900
I am going to go ahead and bring you over to my stove here.

164
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,100
So you will see, I do have a decent amount of pans right now.

165
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,900
The saucepan in the middle here is going to be for my chicken tinga.

166
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:10,100
So make sure you guys have a small sauce pot for your chicken tinga and then I have to cast iron pans here just for my other proteins, my Carnitas and also my steak.

167
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:23,300
So for the vegetarian out there, I just like to go ahead and use a sheet tray with a little bit of foil on it, because we can actually go ahead and just roast our It's alongside our butternut squash.

168
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,400
Okay, alongside that sheet tray for my vegetarian.

169
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,100
Vegan friend.

170
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,000
You will need at least one cast, iron pan.

171
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,200
And that's going to be for your mushrooms.

172
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:40,400
Now, you will notice I have this really large, kind of flat top attachment on my stove as well.

173
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,700
Now for me, this is the best thing you can possibly use to heat up tortilla.

174
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,000
It's right.

175
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,900
We don't want to go ahead and heat up one towards he at a time.

176
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Letting it get cold in the You know, after we're cooking it, so for me, I love to be able to cook at least six tortillas on this flat top.

177
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,000
Now.

178
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,200
If you guys don't have a flat top like this, just having another large cast, iron pan will definitely do the trick.

179
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,700
All right.

180
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,900
Beautiful.

181
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,100
How's the margarita going?

182
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,400
Hopefully, no one went ahead and chugged it.

183
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,300
It is only Tuesday, but no, shame.

184
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,300
Perfect.

185
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Other than that, guy's if you were had your box in front of you, feel free to go ahead and pull out all the ingredients and just kind of neatly lined them up in front of your cooking station, makes your life a little bit easier.

186
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,400
And other than that, I think we can go ahead and is it is only Tuesday?

187
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,200
I know it looks like Friday outside plus we got it is Wednesday.

188
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,900
Oh my God, you guys are totally, right.

189
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,500
We're going to act like, it's Friday, even though it's Taco Tuesday on this Wednesday.

190
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,500
If that Sounds.

191
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,100
All right, beautiful.

192
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,900
Thank you for keeping me in check over there.

193
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,900
McCoy.

194
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,900
Definitely with the knowledge great.

195
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,300
So we do have a little protein prep just to get started beforehand.

196
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:08,300
I also would like Zachary that my loan vegetarian not to section you off, but go ahead and pre-heat your oven to 375.

197
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,500
All right, Zachary only for Zachary.

198
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,100
He is a special person in this entire group.

199
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,700
Group, and we all love him for them.

200
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,400
Great.

201
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,800
So back into our small amount of protein prep.

202
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,400
All I am going to do here.

203
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:31,200
And after the protein prep will go ahead and jump into our side rooms, but just a couple steps before we do that for my protein prep.

204
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,800
I really just want to go ahead and start getting all this meat out and be able to breathe especially the stake here.

205
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Okay, so just getting a steak right out of our compostable packaging here.

206
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,700
I am going to go ahead and just lay it on a linen.

207
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,100
Just to kind of soak up some of that liquid.

208
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,500
If you don't want to use a linen just for this, we can go ahead and just have a paper towel.

209
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,600
Will definitely do the trick.

210
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,900
Okay, I have a thousand of these Linens though.

211
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:02,300
So I have no shame in using that beautiful one protein prep down.

212
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,700
And as I did mention, these bags are 100% compostable.

213
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,900
So if you guys have little home compost, compost at your house, please, just throw them in there.

214
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,900
They will buy generally degrade.

215
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,500
Next up.

216
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,700
I am going to go ahead and just get my chicken tinga in the sauce pot.

217
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,100
Okay.

218
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,600
Now I don't want to turn on that sauce pot.

219
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,800
I just want to get it in there.

220
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:33,300
Okay, just like we said this is just a small amount of prep work before the fun really begins.

221
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,900
So right into my pot, make sure you get all of those sauces from this packaging.

222
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,400
They're so delicious.

223
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,400
Just like the squeeze out with your hands, just like that.

224
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,600
Fantastic, and then just going to put the lid back on.

225
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,900
Like I said, we're not turning on that pot just yet.

226
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
We're just getting it ready.

227
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,400
All right.

228
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,000
Now that leaves us with our Carnitas, the Carnitas can actually stay in the bag here.

229
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,400
But I am just going to go ahead and open them up.

230
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:16,900
I like to open the entire packaging up just, so we keep a nice flat surface for the Carnitas, and we will go ahead and show you why that's important a little bit later.

231
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But as you can see, just opening it up like a book.

232
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,700
Beautiful.

233
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,300
That will do the trick.

234
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,700
Here we go.

235
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,800
So now we got all our proteins, nice and prepped.

236
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:42,600
Chickens in the sauce, pot, steaks, drying out a little bit on a paper towel, Carnitas are opened up getting ready for that cook along.

237
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:49,500
Okay, so we will go ahead and just make sure you hit except on your break rooms here and I will see you guys back here in about seven minutes or so.

238
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,800
So you guys enjoy that margarita.

239
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,300
I also have a dog.

240
00:27:59,300 --> 00:27:59,700
Yes.

241
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,900
You guys are in my house today.

242
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,500
So welcome.

243
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,600
She knows.

244
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:15,200
She knows that guy that she ever belong here.

245
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,900
I love that poll.

246
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,600
By the way.

247
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,900
I also voted for whiskey.

248
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,400
So, great job everyone.

249
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,700
You guys got the right answer.

250
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,700
Beautiful.

251
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,100
Love.

252
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,300
Seeing the photos as well.

253
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,300
Everyone holding on gripping.

254
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,800
Tight to that Margarita.

255
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,500
Beautiful.

256
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,100
Love it.

257
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,500
What's I would love to see some of y'all's favorite whiskies in the chat.

258
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,600
I personally love to drink Booker's.

259
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,100
Booker's is my drink for the most part when it comes down to Whiskey.

260
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,100
Sneezy.

261
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:48,900
Good straight.

262
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
Sipping Wild Turkey 101.

263
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,400
Okay.

264
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,500
Hi.

265
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Hi West.

266
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,400
He's just a simple man.

267
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,500
Love it.

268
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,100
Great, guys.

269
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,600
Well tonight.

270
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,800
We are drinking tequila.

271
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,000
So no one should be mad about that.

272
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,100
The Margaritas are really fantastic.

273
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,100
So let us get kind of down into the grittiness of setting up our clatter.

274
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,400
Right?

275
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,700
So this is going to be called armies and place.

276
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,800
Does anyone know what Mason pluses by chance?

277
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,100
Has anyone watched the Food Network and heard that?

278
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,600
Put your answer in the chat really quickly.

279
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Let us see if I get any Put in place.

280
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,800
Yeah, pretty much.

281
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,900
That's exactly it.

282
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,200
So, we're getting everything in its place.

283
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,500
That's mise-en-place.

284
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,100
Right?

285
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:37,300
So what to means in place for this taco event is going to be, is getting are those little garnishes all those beautiful colors right on the plate first?

286
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:43,100
Okay, and the very first amazing plus, I think that we can essentially do get our prep ready is.

287
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,600
I have our 2, beautiful Salsas here and all I did was put them right into little ramekins.

288
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:55,700
Now, this is sounds like a really small step but Actually adds a lot of value to the perceived value of this ditch.

289
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,000
Right?

290
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,900
We took the time to went ahead and separate our Salsas.

291
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,800
We can use them throughout the night.

292
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,700
It looks beautiful.

293
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,100
Just nice off into their ramekins.

294
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,700
So let us go ahead and start by doing soap, right?

295
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,400
I am looking for a nice plate skills tonight.

296
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,000
Okay, and we can actually do that with just using our vision.

297
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:22,700
Having these beautiful colors that were about to display on our plate, is actually going to be kind of the plate up of this platter at itself.

298
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,700
Other than that, I am going to go ahead and grab my platter for this evening.

299
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,200
This is beautiful, nice white large plate.

300
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:39,100
It's going to have plenty of surface area for me to work with all my garnishes have all three of my All-Star meats, or All is right in the center.

301
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,000
So go ahead and find yourselves a beautiful, nice platter like this.

302
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,600
Okay, and the first thing I am going to be adding to this platter.

303
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,800
We have those pesky lines from that Margarita.

304
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,600
So I think, let us go ahead and just finish the job.

305
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,100
Right?

306
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,900
We have about three quarters of a margarita.

307
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,500
We have our knife and let us just go ahead and create the rest into wedges here.

308
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,800
Like so beautiful.

309
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:13,500
No, Taco is complete without a nice fresh Spritz of that line.

310
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,400
It's right there.

311
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And I am just going to start playing with colors here.

312
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,800
I think we should go ahead and do for the most part.

313
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,300
All of our knife work.

314
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,500
Now here.

315
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,300
I have my market vegetables.

316
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:35,200
These are going to be just fresh seasonal, vegetables, that freshness of the vegetable actually gives a lot of texture to a taco.

317
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,600
I love the little bite of a radish and between some carnitas.

318
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,900
So let us go ahead and attack that.

319
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,400
So just slicing off the top of the package.

320
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,600
These vegetables have already been pre-washed for you.

321
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:57,700
So you can see I have a little yellow carrot and also this just beautiful cherry bomb of a radish are so using my fingertips here.

322
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,400
I am going to actually claw the item.

323
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,000
Now.

324
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,100
I don't want anyone.

325
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:09,600
We're going to do a little pre lesson on how to properly cut something as you can see on a professional chef and I have all 10.

326
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,800
And my fingers, still tell you, I know what I am talking about, right?

327
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,200
So when I cut anything, I am always clawing the Mmm, usually, with these three fingers here.

328
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,100
Okay, so I am gripping it.

329
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:31,700
And as you can tell, when I grip it, my Knuckles kind of protrude out word, which allows me to kind of rest, my knife amongst my Knuckles.

330
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:39,500
And as you can see, my fingertips will naturally kind of push inward being hidden from my knife blade itself.

331
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,300
So let us think a little smart here as well.

332
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,400
This thing rolls around like crazy.

333
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,000
So let us go ahead and give it some nice.

334
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Flat edges.

335
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,200
Nice flat surface to work on.

336
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,300
This looks like a nice little heart.

337
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,100
Let us hear you guys.

338
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,500
There we go, beautiful.

339
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,200
So now we have a, we have a flat surface radish.

340
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,700
My fingertips are gripping.

341
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:08,700
The item Knuckles are, protruding outward firm grip on my knife.

342
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:17,900
And I am just slicing right through and a rocking motion, until I meet an apex in which my reddish is no longer.

343
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:24,300
A safe kind of on this Edge, so I am a tilted back down and then just attack the other side.

344
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,100
Definitely not a race.

345
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,400
We want nice thin slices a vegetable here, okay.

346
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,200
Beautiful.

347
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,300
Now, we kind of made it a little easier ready for you with the carrot.

348
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,000
It's got a nice flat surface.

349
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,500
And for me, I like these to kind of mimic the size of the taco.

350
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,000
So I am going to go ahead and cut them at a diagonal bias.

351
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,700
So they're a little larger, and they just fit nicely onto my taco.

352
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,900
So just like that.

353
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,200
A nice little sweetness from the carrot, alongside its texture.

354
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,600
And the crunch makes her a really nice little taco garnish.

355
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,100
So here we just have our beautiful little bundle.

356
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,900
Showing off those knife skills.

357
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,600
Everyone's got their finger tips.

358
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,300
I hope.

359
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,200
And we're going to roll.

360
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,400
But look at that already.

361
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:22,500
The color of these to the grain from the line, the beautiful carrot alongside the radish, makes this look really beautiful.

362
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:30,000
Now, let us go ahead and finish off a little of this knife work here and I think we're going to do some of this charred onion here.

363
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,600
Slicing it rights?

364
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,700
Open like that.

365
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:39,400
Now you will notice on this onion itself, the root system is still attached.

366
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,400
So just this little button, has the roots still attached.

367
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,200
All we want to do is slice that off.

368
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,200
Don't want to eat that.

369
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,100
Using that same technique.

370
00:42:51,100 --> 00:43:01,300
I am gripping these onion, this onion here, and I am just going to make small little ribbon, so I can go ahead and put this throughout my taco of my choosing.

371
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,800
Beautiful.

372
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,000
Fun.

373
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,200
This right back to our platter.

374
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,500
Love the translucent color.

375
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,400
Fantastic.

376
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,900
Now I am going to go ahead and reach for my chili Tori.

377
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:34,400
Ah, do so, anyone know what a chili Tory Auto is Can anyone guess what pepper this is in this package?

378
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,000
I know there're some Californians out there.

379
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,900
So they definitely know what this is here.

380
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:48,700
I just got a nice, beautiful charred jalapeno and which we then quick pickle with a little lime juice.

381
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,900
Okay, so it's got that dark bite from the grill.

382
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,000
It's got that acidic punch to it from the lime.

383
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,200
And I am just going to strike off the stem.

384
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,300
Now, if you guys don't like the spiciness of this jalapeno, all too much.

385
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,300
We can go ahead and de-seed it from the inside.

386
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:18,800
So, just slicing the center open, not all the way through, but just enough to expose those seeds, you can use the back of your knife.

387
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,200
To just scrape nice and easily out like so.

388
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,200
For me, I like the chili.

389
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:34,200
So I am going to go ahead and put them right back in, and I am just going to slice nice, beautiful wedges of this jalapeno.

390
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,000
Fantastic, nice hatch, stick.

391
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:44,400
And I am going to rest that directly right on top of my onions.

392
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,600
Let us see where you guys are at.

393
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,100
Okay, beautiful head on a swivel.

394
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:56,700
Love it.

395
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,600
Someone's thinking on their feet.

396
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,100
That's a true.

397
00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,700
Chef move.

398
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,300
Great job.

399
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:07,400
So here, just to show you what I am working with so far, have a couple of my garnishes.

400
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,200
Now.

401
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,700
Let us add a little more brightness to this, right?

402
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,300
It's kind of getting a little mold down with these charred, vegetable garnishes with the onion and the jalapeno.

403
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,100
What I want you guys to go ahead and reach for next is what's called.

404
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,100
Need pack that you need.

405
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,600
Peck is a very traditional Yucatan style garnish.

406
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:41,400
You often find these on tostadas and Tacos, but the thing that's so special about SHINee, Peck is the pickling liquid, which usually tends to be vinegar, has been swapped out for citrus juices.

407
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:52,900
So, in this, we have pickled it with orange juice, lime juice, and a little habanero pieces, just to give it a nice kick and it's got some good sweetness from those juices themselves.

408
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,000
And you can just see the color of it is just absolutely stunning.

409
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,900
So, just using your fingertips, we're here to get messy.

410
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:02,800
Kind of drain.

411
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,500
These onions?

412
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,600
Right out.

413
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,900
These are some of my favorite garnishes for a steak taco.

414
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,600
So beautiful.

415
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,100
It's like that.

416
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:25,200
So you can see how I am actually using the rim of my plate, to really set the boundary for all of our garnishes.

417
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,000
Right?

418
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,900
So we're thinking the little smart here and then next up.

419
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,000
I am going to go ahead and reach for some fresh cilantro.

420
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,900
Let us live in this thing up with a little more fresh herbs here, okay.

421
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:43,500
Now just a couple more steps before we do break off into your breakout rooms once more.

422
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,000
So really take the time to set off these garnishes really beautifully.

423
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,900
Feel free to take a couple of those photos once you guys are in there, but just grabbing the cilantro.

424
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,200
It's already been picked for you.

425
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,200
We did the hard stuff.

426
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,600
It's already been washed.

427
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,000
So just give it a little volume, right?

428
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,200
But something's nice and Tall on a play.

429
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,900
It just speaks so much louder.

430
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,500
Look so much more beautiful.

431
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,400
And now, pair them with our house bar herbs.

432
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,900
This is just from a local hyper local Farm here in Austin Texas.

433
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,000
That grows these beautiful little field herbs.

434
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800
Now, not only do they just look gorgeous.

435
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,200
They really do add a lot of different flavors.

436
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:34,100
Now if you have any large pieces like this, Malabar spinach here, feel free to just pick it with your fingers, tear it up into some bite-sized pieces.

437
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,500
Those flowers are edible.

438
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,000
They just give a nice little beautiful.

439
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,500
Look to your plate.

440
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,000
Here we go.

441
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,300
Now, I am starting to get a little more green on my plate.

442
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,500
So, let us go ahead and lighten up the mood.

443
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,800
We have this beautiful quesillo.

444
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,200
They will.

445
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,900
Haka that we get imported at the restaurant.

446
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,600
Every single Friday, from Oaxaca.

447
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:13,400
This is the most insanely delicious cheese you have ever had the way that it's made is that it's stretched and continuously stretched and balled up into a nice large ball.

448
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,900
So here we have those Strands of it.

449
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:24,000
So just pick it with your fingers, definitely snag a little piece for the enjoyment, pre taco.

450
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,900
But this on top of the chicken tinga just makes it so delicious.

451
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,200
So here we go.

452
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,500
And then that leaves me with our last garnish here, which is this avocado.

453
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:49,800
So, the avocado is bagged because we went ahead and just slice the avocado down the middle, just to make sure you guys are getting a nice, beautiful, non bruised, avocado.

454
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:57,400
So once we slice it, we sealed it right back up as if it was brand-new and it is absolutely fantastic.

455
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,400
You will notice the seed is still in the avocado that helps.

456
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,200
The my stay oxidation of it.

457
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,700
So for the last kind of knife work prep.

458
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,700
We have we just have to deep it.

459
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,400
This avocado seed.

460
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,200
Gently striking the center of the avocado with your middle of your knife.

461
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,500
Get in there.

462
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,000
Counter twist both hands.

463
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,600
Beautiful.

464
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,500
Thing is right out.

465
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,700
Now.

466
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,500
I love to cut this on The Cutting Board.

467
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:33,500
Now.

468
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,300
You don't ever need to buy an avocado Spooner right?

469
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:37,700
Or what?

470
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,900
I don't even know what it's called.

471
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,700
I just have this nice antique spoon here that I found perfect for my avocados.

472
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,900
So I am just going to use the spoon to scoop out that beautiful flesh.

473
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,300
Bright and vibrant green.

474
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,400
This avocado.

475
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,800
It's one of my favorite garnishes.

476
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:12,500
Fantastic, and I am just going to go ahead and cut little wedges on a bias like so, For Allah, you can press down, give it that nice fan.

477
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:19,100
Look at that beautiful green eggs, just like that.

478
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,300
Clean up the station, just a little bit.

479
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,500
I know.

480
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,000
Hey, we're here to prove you guys wrong on that shipping of avocados.

481
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,100
It is possible.

482
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,600
We have the technology.

483
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,900
We can ship avocados, worldwide, love it.

484
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:49,600
So hopefully your platter looks just as bright and vibrant as mine, take a quick look, definitely can get this done and I will see you guys here in a minute.

485
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,400

Show us your beautiful platters and let us go Ready to fill them up with some great taco fill-ins.

487
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:58,900

488
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Welcome back, guys.

489
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,500
Hopefully, you will have a little Margarita by the end of this cooking experience.

490
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,700
Definitely encourage drinking while we're eating these tacos.

491
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,000
It really sets off the mood, right?

492
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,100
But with that, welcome back, let us do a quick cheers.

493
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:29,100
Last confidence booster because we're about to get into the actual fire of things.

494
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:34,200
Alright, so here we have our garnish tray set up, right?

495
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,000
It's beautiful.

496
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,900
Hopefully you guys, I definitely piqued.

497
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,600
A couple of these breakout rooms and look stunning.

498
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:46,100
Shouts out to cheffy boy, Zachary Smith with the wood board.

499
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,900
Platter looks freaking fantastic.

500
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:49,400
Absolutely.

501
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:49,700
Love it.

502
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,000
Follow him on Instagram.

503
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:56,500
He went ahead and put we're trying to post up his Chef Instagram here.

504
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:57,900
It's going to be great.

505
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,700
So we have our platter here.

506
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:00,700
It looks beautiful.

507
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:04,600
I saw everyone's super amazing job now.

508
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,200
It's on to the cooking part, right?

509
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,300
The very most important thing about cooking is proper.

510
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,300
On our pans or oven, right?

511
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,500
So we need to make sure these pans are nice and hot.

512
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,700
This is why I love to use cast iron.

513
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:24,900
It retains its heat much, much better than most pans, and it's also really simple to clean out.

514
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,400
You rinse it, wipe it out.

515
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,500
With a paper towel.

516
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,100
It just keeps on getting better.

517
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,400
The seasoning on the pan itself grows with you while you're kind of cooking.

518
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:37,300
So the first thing I want to do come with me to my range here.

519
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,700
Zachary, you got your oven on?

520
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,700
Yes, sir.

521
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,400
Great.

522
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,500
So our oven on is for our vegetarian option.

523
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,400
Mr. Exact.

524
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,000
Everyone else should be working with this.

525
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,300
These pans here.

526
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:50,800
Okay.

527
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,600
So for me, the very first thing, we have our chicken tinga in our sauce pot.

528
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:01,300
I am going to go ahead and start that first, and I am going to turn it on very low.

529
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,900
I just want a nice simmer on my chicken tinga.

530
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,700
I don't want to reduce my sauce.

531
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,400
In there all that much.

532
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,300
I just really want to warm up this chicken.

533
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:11,800
Okay.

534
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:22,000
So the very first thing we're going kind of reverse, little Seer here, chicken tinga on low heat with my other pans.

535
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,300
I am going to go ahead and turn on my tortilla pan.

536
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,900
So this will be your largest pan.

537
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And I also want this on low.

538
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,800
So by time or mates are nice and Cooked.

539
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:44,300
Our tortilla pan will be nice and ready just to warm up these House made Tortillas, okay, and that leaves me with my two solo pants here.

540
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:51,900
One for my carnitas, one, for my steak, now, Zachary with a vegetarian option.

541
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,400
One of these pans will go ahead and be for our mushrooms.

542
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:55,900
Okay.

543
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,400
So here we have the mon.

544
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,200
I am going to go ahead and start preheating.

545
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,200
My pans to just under medium heat.

546
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,800
I want a nice and hot.

547
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,900
But I don't want to really burn down the place, right?

548
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,000
So let us just get that going, beautiful.

549
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,800
This is a nice little Pro tip as well.

550
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,800
As you can see that, I have a bunch of items cooking.

551
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,300
Now.

552
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:25,700
I am always very cautious that I have my handles of my pans, kind of facing the same way.

553
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,200
Right?

554
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,700
And I never want those handles to be in front of the stove.

555
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,200
Just in case you got a kid running around that dog.

556
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,500
Is maybe pulling up here.

557
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,100
They're going to knock this thing.

558
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:40,600
I am always having my pans, just consciously in a single Direction, okay.

559
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,700
So now that our pans are starting to warm up.

560
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,100
Once again on that Medium.

561
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:55,100
I am going to grab that neutral oil that we sent you and I want half of that neutral oil and to each of your pants.

562
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,600
Okay, just like that.

563
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:01,800
Now, this neutral oil has a higher smoke point.

564
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:12,200
That smoke point is going to allow us to get a hotter temperature on her oil which is going to have us have a better texture on our Carnitas are Steak, right?

565
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:16,900
So I want you guys to keep a close eye on your pans.

566
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:23,000
Not looking for a billowing of smoke, but just a small little faint hint of smoke.

567
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
That's the pan saying hey, I am here to party.

568
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,700
Let us get it going.

569
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:33,500
Okay, now for Zach with our vegetarian, I am going to go ahead and jump on that for a moment.

570
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,700
I am going to go ahead and open up our me so grilled carrots.

571
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:38,500
Right here.

572
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,300
We have that and then I have our sweet potato.

573
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,000
That's been part roasted.

574
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,100
Okay, both of these packages are now open.

575
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,100
We're going to go ahead and grab my sheet tray.

576
01:04:52,600 --> 01:05:03,900
Now Zach feel free to go ahead and salt Tay these vegetables instead if you want a little more live action, but for me, I just like to kind of continue to roast them.

577
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,700
So one side is going to have my beautiful.

578
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:07,900
It's on there.

579
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,600
The other my sweet potato.

580
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:19,200
And now that neutral oil, instead of using it on the pan, Zachary go ahead and just sprinkle a little bit directly on top.

581
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:26,100
Beautiful, and I am going to go straight into the oven with these vegetables.

582
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,400
It's like that.

583
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,800
And on that last three minute cook for these vegetables.

584
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:38,100
I am going to actually switch the oven to the broil setting which is going to cook from the above.

585
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,100
Point of the stove.

586
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:44,300
It's going to give a nice color to those carrots and those sweet potatoes in there.

587
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:44,600
Okay?

588
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:51,500
Back to my mate folk garnishes on our plate, polish off to the side.

589
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:58,300
I am going to probably start with my stake here because it's going to need to rest after we cook it.

590
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,600
So we have the oil in the pan.

591
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,500
It's on medium Heat.

592
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,000
Going to be there in about 20 seconds, for sure.

593
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:11,200
Now, when I grab my piece of steak, And this is the pan.

594
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:11,600
Imagine.

595
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,700
This is the pan here.

596
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,300
I am going to lay the steak, just the tip of it.

597
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,000
In the pan must hear the sizzle.

598
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,600
And if you're not hearing the sizzle, pull it right out.

599
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:23,800
Just wait a little bit.

600
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,000
Let us see.

601
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,700
Let me answer a question really quick.

602
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,700
That grape seed is not olive oil.

603
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:35,500
Olive oil is not actually the best oil to use for sauteing items because it has a really low smoke point.

604
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:40,000
So when you're sautéing something really hot and olive oil, you're burning the olive oil.

605
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,700
And we have all probably seen, how all of oil can get $25 a bottle.

606
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,700
You're kind of just wasting money when you're sautéing and olive oil.

607
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:53,600
Now, Italian recipes, I am Italian, do call for sweating things and olive oil.

608
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,200
And that's just a really shallow kind of low heat.

609
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,600
So this is actually grapeseed oil.

610
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:07,200
But what we got going on with the steak, want to hear the sizzle, and then we're going to drop away from us.

611
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,000
So that oil doesn't potentially splatter on.

612
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:10,600
To us.

613
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,400
Do you recommend turning on the vent Hood?

614
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,900
It might get a little hot in here.

615
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,600
And my pan looks nice and ready.

616
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:27,400
So, starting with that steak can see the oil, the viscosity is, it has totally changed?

617
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,700
Great Sizzle, definitely get that mic in their beautiful.

618
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,000
And I am setting it away from me.

619
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:35,100
Now.

620
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:41,200
We're going to cook that steak for about a minute to two minutes on this side and flip it.

621
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,400
Okay, so get those tongues ready.

622
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:52,300
Now, this steak is to be prepared, kind of medium rare, which is the best way to enjoy it in my opinion.

623
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:52,700
Now.

624
01:07:52,700 --> 01:08:00,400
If you do want to have a medium to, well, steak go ahead and add a minute, to a minute, and a half on that cook time on each of these sides.

625
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:00,800
Okay.

626
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,600
So, our steak is rolling.

627
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,600
Which means we're about ready for our Carnitas.

628
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:21,399
Now, we left our Carnitas in this nice Flat state because we want all this surface area to caramelize this layer of Carnitas before we really begin to represent Italians.

629
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:24,899
Yeah, then, you know, sorry reading the chat.

630
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:30,200
We want this surface area to carmelites and really fry in its own fat.

631
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,100
So going to remove that plastic.

632
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:37,300
Back to my pan, viscosity of the oil is beautiful.

633
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:41,100
It's going to lay it in there, and I am not even going to touch it.

634
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:48,000
We're going to cook that for about two minutes and allow it to really fry and its own rendered fat, okay.

635
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,600
Beautiful.

636
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,500
Now Zachary with your mushrooms.

637
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,000
Here.

638
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,899
We can do the same with the pan and getting it, nice and hot.

639
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,300
And then we're really simply just going to saute these bad boys, okay.

640
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,100
So sauteing them should hear the sizzle.

641
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:18,300
Once the oil is nice and hot, add the mushrooms and then kind of just let them cool out and cook for about a minute before we really begin to stir them.

642
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:18,600
Right?

643
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,100
Because we want that caramelization.

644
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,300
We want that color on those mushrooms.

645
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:31,300
Let us see, any other questions about neutral oil.

646
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:31,700
Nope.

647
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,000
Neutral oil is just really cheap.

648
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,399
Honestly, for me personally.

649
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,100
I use neutral oil for every cooking, pretty much procedure.

650
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:49,200
And that's like I said, it's for like a specific recipe and which I am using olive oil to kind of sweat and embed those onions and baby carrots with some of that olive oil flavor.

651
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,100
But yeah grapeseed oil which is the neutral Oil.

652
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:56,600
We're using super cheap and it gets better product out of it.

653
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:57,000
Yep.

654
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
High Point.

655
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,800
So, smart used avocado as well.

656
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,200
That's also a great neutral oil.

657
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:04,900
Beautiful.

658
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,300
So just showing you guys my stake here.

659
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,000
It's been about 2 minutes.

660
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,100
I am going to go ahead and flip it over.

661
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:18,200
It's got this nice dark caramelization on it that dark Amber red.

662
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:22,600
And so another 2 minutes on this side should do the trick.

663
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,900
And then once that two minutes is up directly from my pan.

664
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:32,400
I am just going to come and rest my steak on my cutting board, right?

665
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,300
Fantastic, so it's been a couple of minutes.

666
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:40,800
My Carnitas are quite literally popping off right now, which is a great, great sign.

667
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:49,600
If they're popping a little bit too much, you can go ahead and turn down the heat, but let us look at some of this great color.

668
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,300
We got.

669
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,500
Yeah, the caramelization definitely happening.

670
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:56,200
Beautiful.

671
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,500
Going to go ahead and mix in that kind of fried.

672
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,000
Consistent Carnitas.

673
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,700
Let us take a look at our chicken tinga, beautiful.

674
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,100
Small reduce just give it a good stir.

675
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,100
So that's been another minute or two on my steak.

676
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:26,000
So I am going to go ahead and turn off the heat on my steak going to bring that over to my cutting board.

677
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,300
Let that thing, rest.

678
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,200
For exact Curry's pleasure.

679
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:39,900
I am going to go ahead and just saute my mushrooms in that cast iron pan.

680
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,100
It's got some great color.

681
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:47,600
Beautiful.

682
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,700
So, the mmm does anyone know the importance of letting?

683
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,100
The steak rests.

684
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,100
What do you guys think is happening, you know, cooking is so much for me.

685
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:05,000
I really begun to excel in my career when I began to really observe quite literally what's just happening.

686
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,200
This is an applied science in my opinion, which makes this entire, you know, room of your house.

687
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:14,600
A living laboratory, which makes it so much more fun to really get in the kitchen.

688
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,800
Get your hands on some ingredients and cook.

689
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,700
So let us say yeah, the juices.

690
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:23,700
Exactly.

691
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,700
So think about it, right.

692
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:29,600
We just expose this meet a lot of heat, which is opening up pores, right?

693
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,100
Ladies.

694
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,800
And I mean my skin routine at nighttime jump out of the shower.

695
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:39,100
My pores are freaking size of pepperonis that heat is just expanding them open.

696
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,000
So all that poor in the stake.

697
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,500
Here is expanding, once we take it back to that cold State outside of the pan.

698
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,200
It's going to shrivel.

699
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,900
Back up sucking in all those juices, right?

700
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,600
Beautiful.

701
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,100
So sauteing some mushrooms, getting some great color.

702
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,800
These pork carnitas definitely popping, which is great.

703
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,300
Got some great caramelization.

704
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:10,300
You can see all the extra fat that's just been rendered from the pork itself.

705
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:19,300
I am actually going to go ahead and turn my pan off just because they look nice and golden, but I want these Carnitas to go ahead and just remain in the pan.

706
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,400
My chicken tinga looks nice and hot thoroughly all throughout.

707
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,500
So, I as well, we will turn that off.

708
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:36,000
And at this point Zach, let us go ahead and probably turn that oven to that broil State just for about a minute or two.

709
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:42,800
Just to give it a final color on our, our mushroom or excuse me, our carrots, and our sweet potatoes.

710
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,100
So let us do that real quick.

711
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Perfect.

712
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,700
Do a little wipe down at the station.

713
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,400
Now, our meats are nice and hot.

714
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,100
They're beautifully caramelized.

715
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,700
Our steak is resting.

716
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:09,500
The last thing we need to be doing our next thing, we should be doing preparing our tortillas.

717
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,500
So through the company to MOA.

718
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:23,100
We buy literally about two tons of dried corn every 6 months and this corn comes from different areas, all throughout Mexico.

719
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,600
Absolutely, beautiful.

720
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:26,800
You will notice here.

721
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,000
I have these Pink House made Tortillas.

722
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:34,400
Now the elevation that all of these different pieces of corn.

723
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:40,200
Growing really alter the change in the way you cook these tortillas in general.

724
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,000
So just taking them out of the bag.

725
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:48,300
I am going to separate the tortillas from the paper recyclable.

726
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,000
Just like that.

727
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,200
We're letting them breathe.

728
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:00,800
And we already was smart enough to go ahead and turn on our tortilla pan.

729
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:05,300
Some really warming these things up, should take no time at all.

730
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:22,300
Beautiful, and just want to mention, I did turn off all of my heat sources on my pans, and I am letting those items stay in the pan just to stay warm until we really hit the plate with them.

731
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:22,700
Okay.

732
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,800
So I have my clean linen here.

733
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,200
Wrong one here.

734
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,300
It is beautiful.

735
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:34,000
So I am just going to take this over to my workstation are my Kamal.

736
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,100
I have this beautiful little tiny spatula.

737
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:38,700
Absolutely.

738
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,100
Love it.

739
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,400
Thank you, Central Market.

740
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:45,500
And nice and hot pan already just nice and warm.

741
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,000
No oil is needed whatsoever.

742
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,700
There's plenty of natural oil in this tortilla.

743
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,000
Now.

744
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,700
The only thing that should ever be in your corn.

745
01:15:54,700 --> 01:16:00,200
Tortilla is dried corn, obviously, water and salt.

746
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:10,800
So this is a natural gluten-free, you know, vegan option for tacos and it makes the best tacos in the world must be made from fresh.

747
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:19,400
Massa, I am just going to go ahead and cook these for 30 seconds on each side.

748
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,300
Beautiful.

749
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,400
Definitely have my dog started to come and circle around like a shark.

750
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,100
She's psycho.

751
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,300
She definitely her favorite.

752
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,600
Taco is probably the steak carnitas.

753
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:38,400
Yeah.

754
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:44,600
She's looking at me like she said and hasn't eaten dinner, but she got well-fed beforehand.

755
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:46,900
Beautiful.

756
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:55,200
So as you can see my tortillas 30 seconds on each side, this is Master Level Kemal work.

757
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,100
When you can do it with your fingertips here.

758
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,500
And like I said, these are already totally cooked for you.

759
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,200
So all we got to do is really warm them up.

760
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:17,600
So right into my Fresh Linen, it's going to act as a steamer, right?

761
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:22,000
So here just going to place my Fresh Tortillas.

762
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,300
If they inflate on you.

763
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,500
That's just a really amazing great sign that it's a Fresh Tortilla.

764
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,200
And then redo the steps here.

765
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,700
Make sure you close that linen.

766
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:39,700
We want to keep that heat Source inside, right?

767
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:47,100
Do you guys smell the natural kind of oils being released from these tortillas, as we're cooking?

768
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,800
It's kind of like toasting bread, right?

769
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,000
We don't necessarily so proud.

770
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:52,400
Jesse.

771
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,200
I am proud of you.

772
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,000
It should be smelling amazing and everyone's house right now.

773
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,200
Take a look at my vegetable Zack.

774
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,800
We don't want to forget about that.

775
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,800
That Broiler does work fast.

776
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,600
Just a small amount of color tortillas or coming too long.

777
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:14,900
Beautiful.

778
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:23,000
So add to our pile here, people are start to be coming out of y'all's house.

779
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,200
Like y'all didn't even know was there right?

780
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:30,600
Y'all guess this past weekend watching, some footballs guarantee at they're still over waiting for some tacos.

781
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:42,600
So right into my stack, some more hot tortillas going to just fold over my tortillas and put them on a nice plate.

782
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,700
Remember this presentation is everything.

783
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:52,100
I mean, how beautiful is it when we just have a nice little blanket of sleeping tortillas like that.

784
01:18:54,500 --> 01:19:02,500
Fantastic guys, so close to that final and first bite of heaven.

785
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,600
So now we have our station, right?

786
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,700
All our Foods hot here.

787
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,800
We are getting ready to Plate.

788
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:10,500
Now.

789
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:16,800
We have our code, you steak on the counter, aren't on our cutting board here.

790
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:20,600
Looks nice and delicious.

791
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,700
You can see all those beautiful juices being sucked back in.

792
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,400
Now, you can see the striation of the meat, right?

793
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,800
And here's a pro tip for you guys.

794
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,200
We always want to cut our meat against the grain.

795
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,200
We don't want to chew with the grain.

796
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:38,900
We want our mouth to, you know, cut through the meat itself.

797
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:47,000
So find where those long strands of kind of caramelized meet go, and we're going to cut opposite of it.

798
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:53,600
So here, I am just cutting nice, beautiful, traditional little fajita ribbons.

799
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:59,700
This will be the first item to hit our plate here.

800
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,400
Like I said, beautiful medium rare.

801
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,100
Absolutely beautiful for me.

802
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,900
I like to just use my knife and kind of hatch.

803
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,100
Stick them like that.

804
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,200
We're going to go right in the center.

805
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,400
Our platter.

806
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,000
Maybe for you.

807
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:20,400
Zach.

808
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:26,700
This is the carrots to match kind of the length, beautiful already.

809
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:28,500
And then next up.

810
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,400
I am going to go ahead and divide it with my chicken tinga.

811
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,000
For having one of these spoons here.

812
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,600
Super Saucy.

813
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,800
This adobo Chipotle blend.

814
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,000
That just coats.

815
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,800
All of this chicken just makes it.

816
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:52,200
Absolutely amazing smells so good.

817
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,100
Make sure you get all that sauce from that pan.

818
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:03,100
And I am just going to finish with my absolutely beautiful Carnitas.

819
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,200
Now, for me.

820
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:11,200
The best tool is going to be the tongs because there is a decent amount of that rendered fat still.

821
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:14,700
So just give a nice dripping on top of your plate.

822
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:17,600
Oh, yeah.

823
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:22,200
Guys, I am salivating so bad right now.

824
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,600
It's hard for me to talk.

825
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:27,500
Oh Lord.

826
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,800
This is unfair that we get to eat this way.

827
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,200
Seriously guys.

828
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,000
Fluff up some of those herbs.

829
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,900
Let us get our beautiful platter coming back together.

830
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:41,600
Strong.

831
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,400
Introduce these beautiful Salsas.

832
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,400
Look at this spread, good Lord.

833
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,300
Here we have it.

834
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,900
He will even get a little Margarita left.

835
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:00,700
Look at that.

836
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:01,700
So guys.

837
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:05,600
Once you're at this point, we're going to jump again into another breakout room.

838
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,100
Of course.

839
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,000
I want to hear.

840
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,100
I am going to eat a taco with you guys.

841
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,300
I want to hear any questions.

842
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:11,900
You guys have.

843
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,000
Oh my God, Emily.

844
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,500
Can we get Emily hired for assembly here?

845
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,900
I need some help on these events.

846
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:22,600
All right, that looks freaking amazing.

847
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
She's got my vote.

848
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
By the way, if there's a winner for this, I am sorry, everyone else.

849
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
She beat ya will to it.

850
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,100
Emily seems to have won this contest.

851
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:37,900
Are you food?

852
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,800
Are you actually like a food stylist on Instagram or something or no?

853
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:46,300
But you missed and we all did beyond that.

854
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:57,300
It's giving you guys a hard time for not having all the like plating, but I think it turned out.

855
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,600
I love The Cutting Board.

856
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,700
It looks amazing for that Final Touch.

857
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:02,500
No, Emily here.

858
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,500
I want you to do this live with me, right?

859
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,400
Go ahead and grab them.

860
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,400
Maldon salt.

861
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,400
We sent you yet.

862
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,500
We got to get our salt day on.

863
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:11,800
All right.

864
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:15,600
So maldon, salt is going to be a larger flake salt.

865
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,200
Right?

866
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:24,900
So, the reason we put this on at the very end is because we want to tie in all these intense flavors at the very top-level, right?

867
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,000
So when we get that salt just on top.

868
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,400
Oh wait, use your hands.

869
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,000
There we go.

870
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,300
Yeah, beautiful.

871
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:36,400
So we're always seasoning from above because we want to capture as much surface.

872
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,600
This area right as possible.

873
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:42,800
We don't want real small pinches of salt, all over the place.

874
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:46,000
We want to sporadic almost like a shotgun blast, right?

875
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,200
All of that, seasoning, right onto the plate.

876
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,000
Fantastic, everyone do yourself a, get it going on.

877
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:52,400
All right.

878
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,000
Amazing.

879
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,600
Hopefully, it smells great.

880
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,700
All these plates are looking fabulous.

881
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:13,000
Fantastic, we're definitely going to have to post some of these on our Instagram and my Instagram is well, I would love that.

882
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,100
Producer throwing on Instagram in the chat.

883
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:27,200
Hopefully everyone's coming to the fruition of their platter being assembled Zachary house.

884
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,800
The house the vegetarian coming along.

885
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:41,900
Should get some nice color on the butternut squash or excuse me in this, sweet potatoes as carrots should have a nice Grill touch to them as well.

886
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,900
Perfect out.

887
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,000
He's already finished.

888
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,800
Those mushrooms are, I wish everyone could have those mushrooms.

889
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:59,100
So, in the mushroom mixture, we add with called wila coche.

890
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:04,600
Now, we get this also weekly and this is going to be a raw corn truffle.

891
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,300
Unfortunately.

892
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:13,700
We don't get this raw beautiful product in the States because of our corn being so genetically modified, which is a whole other issue.

893
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:17,900
That's the whole thing, but you're able to enjoy that real authentic.

894
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:22,000
Fresh probably a new ingredient that you have been having fourth, which is amazing.

895
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:25,700
Man, all right.

896
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:26,900
I am a dive in on a Taco.

897
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,300
This is been staring at me too much.

898
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:32,000
What's the consensus?

899
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:32,600
What is everyone?

900
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,500
Starting with carnitas steak Tanga?

901
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,200
Let us see what they got going on.

902
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,300
I think I might I am just it's probably eating right now.

903
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,700
So they can't take things in, right?

904
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,400
That's fair.

905
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,500
Everyone's Max are going to be all greased up.

906
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,100
Yeah, right.

907
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,800
Wow, Lee.

908
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,600
That's a gorgeous plate.

909
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,300
Look at that.

910
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,100
Andrew.

911
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,700
Very nice.

912
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,600
Jesse beautiful, man.

913
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,600
These plates are gorgeous.

914
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,700
So let us start dropping in some questions.

915
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:12,400
We have got a few questions here in QA with Linda's.

916
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,500
First question.

917
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:18,700
Okay, Chef, what is neutral oil?

918
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:26,600
Yeah, so neutral oil, as we said before, is a neutral oil.

919
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,600
It doesn't have a very Bold Flavor like olive oil does, right?

920
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,800
Because olive oil is made of Olives.

921
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:45,100
It tastes like all this neutral oil is just kind of plain Bland Flavor now, I don't want to say Bland and a negative term because to me, it does technically have a flavor for instance.

922
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:50,400
I use it to pop popcorn and I really love the flavor of grapeseed on my popcorn.

923
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,300
Which I guess I am just weird about that.

924
01:26:52,300 --> 01:27:12,900
I am not sure but this oil allows you to heat up your pan a little higher than other oils, like olive oil allowing you to get a better texture on your food without burning that oil which could potentially, you know contaminate and make your food taste a little bitter, you know an onslaught of things.

925
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,000
Good question though.

926
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:14,900
Gotcha.

927
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:20,300
So is are there particular oils that are considered neutral?

928
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:44,900
Yeah, so I use grape seed oil, grapeseed oil is my favorite oil to use for cooking when it comes to sauteing our, you know, like shallow frying, something olive oil more, so for salad dressings, or finishing a pasta, so you're not, you know, really abusing the oil on its temperature, but we're actually using it for the flavor of the oil itself.

929
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:58,900
And then of course, like shortening for frying, even higher smoke point, so, Able to you know, fry things at 400 degrees getting that super text crispy texture on wings, you know, tater tots things like that.

930
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:03,700
Is canola oil, considered neutral and was Askin?

931
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,300
Yes, technically I use canola more.

932
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:12,500
So for frying, just because it does have a higher caloric intake, right?

933
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:16,700
And if you're frying, something like might as well just take it all.

934
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:17,100
Anyway.

935
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:23,200
So yeah, I use canola a little bit more for frying, really, really love grape seed.

936
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:26,900
Oil for my main use of personal cooking.

937
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:28,700
Good to note.

938
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,400
All right, we got a question from Ali.

939
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:36,000
Could you remind us which toppings are supposed to pair with, which proteins?

940
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:44,700
Every year, every topping goes with all of these proteins, honestly, we're inviting you to kind of figure out your own blend, right?

941
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:58,700
So for me, as you can see, I really love the salsa verde with the Carnitas and just avocado, but that's not to say that you shouldn't try the salsa verde with the chicken and, you know, carrots.

942
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,900
It's all really just for you to explore.

943
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:05,000
We give you a decent amount of these tortillas.

944
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,100
So you're really having a full deck to play.

945
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,500
But yeah, just figure out what your favorite combination.

946
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:11,400
Like.

947
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:17,300
I love the steak and the SHINee Peck together, but that's not technically the exact way.

948
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:18,900
We encourage you guys to eat it.

949
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:25,000
So play along, feel free to dive in on different garnishes until you figure out your favorite.

950
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,800
Another question here from Danielle.

951
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,800
Do you prefer a flavored Marg or a classic?

952
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,900
A flavored.

953
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:36,300
Yeah.

954
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,800
Here in Austin, Texas.

955
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,900
I feel like I live on that Tex-Mex aisle off South First Street here.

956
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:45,900
So for me mango frozen.

957
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:56,700
Margarita is just like, you know, just hits it a different spot than a, just a traditional line, but I really love just a nice traditional one on the Rocks.

958
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:57,000
Yeah.

959
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,000
Nice.

960
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,900
Emily's all about the spicy bars.

961
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:03,600
Honestly, that's the thing for me is, I don't necessarily like The Salt Room.

962
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,600
Interesting.

963
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,600
Alright, well, we're opening it up.

964
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:16,900
If anyone wants to jump on stage and show us your plate or your empty playing or just come on up and ask a question to Chef.

965
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,500
You're welcome to Joey.

966
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,300
Yes.

967
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,400
I agreed Sean.

968
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,500
That plate, looks amazing.

969
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:33,900
I hope half of that is gone already, but this is a video to delicious everyone's off chowing down there.

970
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,900
Down anyone who wanted to shout down with us on stage?

971
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,100
I am only a taco by tense.

972
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:42,500
Okay.

973
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:45,100
If not, oh, here we go.

974
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:45,900
Andrews.

975
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:47,700
He's intrigued.

976
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,300
Alexis is getting right off the stove.

977
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:51,900
Got it.

978
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:54,100
That is the my, a professional chef move.

979
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:55,100
You can possibly do.

980
01:30:55,100 --> 01:31:00,100
I do that twice a day, three days on our three times on Sunday.

981
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:02,200
I guarantee it like that is such a chef thing.

982
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,000
So wait and be right in line with me.

983
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:05,600
Good job.

984
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,300
Alexis you want to come on stage?

985
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:11,300
He said you're confused about how people were plating.

986
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,200
Well, we will invite you with totally up to you.

987
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:16,900
If you want to join us.

988
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:18,300
I in the meantime.

989
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:21,400
Andrew, is down to jump on up.

990
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,200
Hello, Andrew.

991
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,400
Hey, how's it going?

992
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:25,600
I have got my tortilla.

993
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,300
Nice.

994
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,000
I am gonna get this one.

995
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:29,800
Is this?

996
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:32,100
This is the Andrew song special here.

997
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,900
Yeah, so I am going to try to make a Korean.

998
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,500
Taco, because I am Korean love it, ingredients.

999
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:49,700
Little bit of a talk.

1000
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:50,300
Okay.

1001
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:53,900
Talk to your right.

1002
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,700
What are these leaves again?

1003
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:06,000
Yeah, so that in particular the bundle that we do send you is just a field medley of herbs.

1004
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:14,400
But that one in your hand was a Malabar spinach leaf lettuce.

1005
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,300
Got more kids coming on my side.

1006
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:23,100
So you will start hearing some kids screaming, but I am going to top this off with some salsa.

1007
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:24,900
Love it.

1008
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,000
Nice.

1009
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:28,100
That sounds like my taco.

1010
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,100
Cheers.

1011
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:34,800
Cheers Alexis, so how's it going with plating?

1012
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:40,100
I mean, you're just diving right in the drink.

1013
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,200
I didn't know the artistic plate was part of it.

1014
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:55,700
I was like very much building, right into a taco in my mouth, kudos to all providers out there.

1015
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:56,800
That wasn't me.

1016
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,100
What's yours do you Alexis?

1017
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:03,800
It looks like Zachary Smith is down.

1018
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,300
Eat on stage with us.

1019
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:06,400
Yeah, take me off.

1020
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,900
I don't want to see me anymore.

1021
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:09,900
You're welcome.

1022
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:10,500
Today.

1023
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:13,600
We're all just hang it right through Andrew.

1024
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,000
Thank you Chef.

1025
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:15,800
That was wonderful.

1026
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,300
Thank you.

1027
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,200
I would love to ask.

1028
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,800
What's everyone's favorite.

1029
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:22,200
Salsa.

1030
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:27,400
You guys lean towards the Verde like myself, or do you like this month pregnancy or bit more?

1031
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,400
The answer is yes, Emily.

1032
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:32,600
You have a fourth Taco.

1033
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:33,700
Maybe even if it.

1034
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,100
All right, I gotta say, my favorite.

1035
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:45,900
I think out of the three meats, I have here, the fork with the soft rubber dogs.

1036
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,700
Yeah, it's clutch.

1037
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:51,300
Shelby boy, gets it.

1038
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:53,400
I really eat.

1039
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:54,800
One of the meat straight up.

1040
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,400
Probably go for the steak.

1041
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:03,300
But when you put the toppings with the Carnitas, that's the best.

1042
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,000
It's a magical feeling.

1043
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,200
It's a Magical pair.

1044
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:10,300
That's what we're here for, right?

1045
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:13,800
I felt all my good brain controls released.

1046
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:22,600
Once I get into that when we got to feed the Sous chefs to, so make sure you feed your for making some shots.

1047
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:42,600
Swallows it, they do the sweeping, you know, they have come through and especially my line in my kitchen is always nice and clean my little Hoover vacuum suit sous-chef over here.

1048
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,300
Keeps it tight.

1049
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:49,100
Yeah, whenever she's not around, they drop something on the floor.

1050
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:51,400
What do I do now?

1051
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,100
I know it's like, so I do I have to pick this up?

1052
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:54,900
This is not fair.

1053
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:58,000
Starting work, Chef.

1054
01:34:58,300 --> 01:34:59,000
Great job.

1055
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:00,200
Great job.

1056
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:13,800
All right, so we're going to move to lounge and Continue the remainder of this time together and lounges are there.

1057
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,200
Any final thoughts?

1058
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:28,100
Chef that you have for us any like tips, best practices, a Twitter, quote, anything, keep those fingertips tucked in?

1059
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:28,700
All right.

1060
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,200
Next time I see you guys.

1061
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:33,000
I better see all everyone with 10 fingers.

1062
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:34,300
Keep on cooking.

1063
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:39,100
It's, you know your own expression, and we're here to eat.

1064
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:40,400
So Enjoy the food, guys.

1065
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,600
It was really such a pleasure cooking with all of you.

1066
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:44,700
I am looking forward to the next one.

1067
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:45,700
So I will see you then.

1068
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:47,800
Thank you, everyone.

1069
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,200
Enjoy your food idea.

1070
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:09,600
We grow primarily Greens on here and I wanted to have more land because gardening was a hobby that got out of control.

1071
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,200
So we practice permaculture principles out here.

1072
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:21,100
The way you can Define permaculture is that get is a way to design an ecosystem that is beneficial to plan.

1073
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,700
Soil and humans.

1074
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:28,100
One of our primary missions is to lead the land in better shape than when we found it.

1075
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,800
A lot of farms, don't practice that we have these tunnels.

1076
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,100
We have hundred-foot tunnels.

1077
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:36,600
We have five of them on our farm right now, and they are great.

1078
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,200
Protectors from extreme weather star Greenhouse.

1079
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:50,100
And then we transplant by hand, all of these letters, heads that we have grown in our Greenhouse from seed.

1080
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,500
So, everything we grow here, we have grown ourselves.

1081
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:57,200
I love, love, love growing lettuce.

1082
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:07,900
What you'd be enjoying at your event or lettuce is from this bed and most likely this bed for the folks who are going to be part of this event.

1083
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,100
I think you're going to really like this lettuce.

1084
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:18,300
One of the things that I really love about Austin is how food-centric it is.

1085
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:22,900
So many great restaurants in Austin by local and local farms.

1086
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,900
There's a really nice healthy diversity of farms.

1087
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:34,800
And that wouldn't exist if restaurants and school districts, grocery stores, weren't supporting those local farms.

1088
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:41,300
The more you keep your money local, the more you're growing the economy and the more you're Growing the future health of your own community.

1089
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:44,500
And that's, it's great to see, Austin.

1090
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,300
Not only talk that talk.

1091
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,400
I really walk that walk.

1092
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,500
She knows what's coming.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Put it in all caps so that I hear it better.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,000
That's that doesn't make any sense.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,600
Anyways, that's what we're going to do.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,600
We're going to use the chat for any questions.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,400
If I need to slow down, please let me know.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,700
I am going to go ahead and try to like, slow it down.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,300
Come back checking on everyone and give everyone a break to make sure we're all caught up.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,100
I do want to go ahead and let you all check in with each other.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,200
A little bit of connection.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,100
Just a moment.

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,400
We're going to see that pop up.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,200
That Linda was telling us about appear on your screen.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,900
Inviting you to the breakout room.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Just hit except and I will see you back here in about seven minutes for the plant-based kit.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,500
Remember before you go on that.

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Breakout Ro room.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,400
Turn your oven up to 400°.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,300
Now do that now so that way we're not playing catch-up.

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,600
All right, get your plates ready.

20
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,800
Get your knives ready.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,200
Sharpen those knives up.

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,000
We're not going in the microwave tonight.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're going on the stove or using fire.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, okay.

25
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:52,400
Owner of Olden, Food, Forest a sustainable Farm in Rogers, Texas, we grow primarily Greens on here, 2016 started, Urban farming in South Austin, and I wanted to have more land because gardening was a hobby that got out of control.

26
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,000
So we practice permaculture principles out here.

27
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:06,200
The way you can Define permaculture is that it is a way to design an ecosystem that is beneficial to Plants soil, and humans.

28
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,200
One of our primary missions is to lead the land in better shape than when we found it.

29
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,700
A lot of farms don't practice that we have these tunnels.

30
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,000
We have Hundred-Foot tunnels.

31
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,500
We have 5 mm on our farm right now, and they are great.

32
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,100
Protectors from extreme weather star Greenhouse.

33
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,000
And then we transplant by hand, all of these letters, heads that we have grown in our Greenhouse from seed.

34
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,500
So, everything we grow here, we have grown ourselves.

35
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,100
I love, love, love growing lettuce.

36
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:49,900
Well, you'd be enjoying at your event or lettuce is from this bed and most likely this bed for the folks who are going to be part of this event.

37
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,000
I think you're going to really like this lettuce.

38
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,200
One of the things that I really love about Austin is how food-centric it is.

39
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,800
So many great restaurants in Austin by local farms.

40
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,900
There's a really nice healthy diversity of farms.

41
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:16,700
And that wouldn't exist if restaurants and school districts, grocery stores, weren't supporting those local farms.

42
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,300
The more you keep your money local, the more you're growing the economy and the more you're Growing the future health of your own community.

43
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,400
And that's, it's great to see Austin.

44
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,300
Not only talk that talk, don't really walk that walk.

45
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,100
Awesome, and that's Austin or whatever Community you're in.

46
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:53,200
We have truly believed to support your local food community and to keep the food economy, booming that you must put your dollars back into that and enjoy the freshest, most delicious foods because I guarantee you wherever you are.

47
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,100
I saw some cities, you're in San Diego.

48
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,400
Has one of the best farmers markets in the world.

49
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,900
You're going to find these great products and it really great that we can bring this Central Texas.

50
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,100
Mostly Austin Centric, But Central Texas ingredients to you.

51
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,300
Now, you don't have salads out.

52
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,200
You don't have that lettuce.

53
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
That lettuce is out of season until early next year.

54
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:23,900
However, and that there's a small part of the video where the onions are sticking up and those onions, take about eight months to grow.

55
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,400
And we're actually using those sweet Texas onions today that were growing.

56
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,800
When that video was filmed pretty cool.

57
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,300
Alright, so at a certain point, too, Two or a few points this evening.

58
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,400
I am going to break away and say, okay plant-based kit standard kit.

59
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,400
This is one of those moments.

60
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,900
I want to be really clear about that.

61
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,500
Alrighty.

62
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,900
So here we go.

63
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Plant-based kit.

64
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,400
I had said earlier to go ahead and heat up your oven a little preheated 400 degrees.

65
00:10:52,700 --> 00:11:00,900
One thing I like to do just for cleanliness sake because I always like to kind of line my baking dishes casserole, pan, cookie pan with foil.

66
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,800
When I am cooking these Foods, you Savory Foods.

67
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,300
So that when I am done with this, I can use my agrees.

68
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,600
I can just pull that foil off, give it a quick rinse, and my pot is now clean.

69
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,700
I am going to go ahead and put this in the oven.

70
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,900
I have combined.

71
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,400
Both the sweet potato and the carrot.

72
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,300
But I have not put those mushrooms in there.

73
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,600
Again.

74
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,200
This is for the plant-based kit.

75
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:34,100
There's about 10 or 12 of you who have that kit, the carrots and the sweet potatoes are in the oven.

76
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
Your mushrooms are sitting next to your stove.

77
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,900
All right, you are taken care of for a minute.

78
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:47,300
I am now going to go over to the standard kit and talk about the proteins that we are going to cook in those pans that I told you earlier to have on the stove.

79
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,800
I have already heated them up.

80
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,900
Because I like to get a little bit of a jump start.

81
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,800
So go ahead and start heating your pans up at this point.

82
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,400
And for the plan base, we are also going to do a little sauteing.

83
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,900
So you two will have a saute pan for your mushrooms.

84
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,000
But let us get your pan heated up.

85
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,200
Now.

86
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,700
One thing I like to do is I like to take my three proteins back to the standard kit.

87
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,000
Now.

88
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,900
I am going to take my three proteins.

89
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,300
I have a chicken tinga.

90
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,100
I have a pork carnitas and then I have some carne asada made with this delicious pea, Loretta.

91
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,600
Strip steak.

92
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,200
So I have those three proteins.

93
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,100
I have taken my knife, and I am cutting this almost like a book.

94
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,800
So that I can open my compostable packaging up all the way.

95
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:43,600
I am going to use this packaging, not only as a tool, but when I am finished with it, I am going to put it in my compost, and I am going to use it to go back into the Earth.

96
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Okay, we're very proud of the fact that we have figure out a way to Source.

97
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
All compostable, packaging.

98
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,900
I am moving to the stovetop now.

99
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,800
All right, I have my chicken team.

100
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:02,400
You're going right into the pot for the little lid on it.

101
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,300
Would put this on low heat.

102
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,700
This is my Kamala talking about earlier, or my flat top or griddle top.

103
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,400
Sometimes it's called a Plancha.

104
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,400
I have this on a very low heat.

105
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,900
I am going to cook some tortillas here.

106
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,400
I am also going to heat up my chicken.

107
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Get I have chicken in there.

108
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
My sauce pots.

109
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:27,900
Now, I have started my cast iron and then for those who have the plant base, I have a saute pan here.

110
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,200
I am just going to put a little bit of fat and you have a package it says new.

111
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:40,700
True loyal in your kit, and we're going to put some of that neutral oil onto our heating up pans.

112
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,500
Well, hands aren't super hot yet because I just asked you to turn them on, but they're going to get there in a minute.

113
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,600
You're going to start to see some of this oil start to smoke.

114
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,600
That is good.

115
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,300
We're at that smoking point.

116
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,500
A little bit of white or gray smoke or light colored gray.

117
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,600
Smoke is great.

118
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,600
We're scared of black smoke, but we like gray smoke.

119
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,000
Okay.

120
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,100
First, I am going to eat see here, my carne asada.

121
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,400
Am I pants since I saw that smoke?

122
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,300
I know it's hot enough to do what I needed to do here.

123
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,500
All righty.

124
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:30,100
Now my other saute pan, I am just sort of waiting for that when that oil, when the viscosity of, it turns into more like a water texture, will know where they are.

125
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,100
All right.

126
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,600
After the sear on this.

127
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,100
I am going to use the same pan to heat up my carnitas.

128
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,400
So that's just going to go for a minute.

129
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,800
I have that at about a medium to medium-high heat.

130
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,700
Yes, you can.

131
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,800
It's a home packaging compostable it.

132
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,700
Is it takes a little longer, right?

133
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,200
I wouldn't like, lying here rose with it, but you can put it straight into your compost.

134
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,600
I am going to go ahead and open up my tortilla packaging because I like to get a little bit of air in those tortillas.

135
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,900
All right, I am starting to smell the aroma of that steak.

136
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,900
I am going to come back over here.

137
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,100
Let me grab my tongs.

138
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,800
Now remember, this steak is already fully cooked.

139
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,900
All we're doing is we're getting a sear on it.

140
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,800
For a little bit of texture and flavor, and we're heating it through.

141
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,700
I also see that my own oil now is this shimmering around the pan?

142
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:53,800
So I am going to put plant-based kit, my mushrooms in here and start to saute these Now, these are mushrooms with a mixture of aromatic.

143
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,700
Some of those delicious onions from Bolton Food, Forest and Wheeler coche.

144
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,500
Does anybody know what we look on chairs?

145
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,300
No, takers on the wheelchair.

146
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,900
Will it talk to an is a fungus that grows on the outside of corner?

147
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,600
So that is correct.

148
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:24,900
Chris.

149
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:32,200
It is a corn fungus and it is a delicacy in many parts of the world, especially in Mexico.

150
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,500
And some of the other Latin American countries.

151
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,600
All right, when we come back over here and give this a flip.

152
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,500
If you see, I have some nice caramelization on my steak.

153
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,900
When we go ahead and lower my heat down to medium-low.

154
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,100
Let that heat through.

155
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,600
I am also checking my mushrooms here.

156
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,700
Giving them saute with your cooking.

157
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,600
Those mushrooms are going to get also very aromatic or going to start to smell.

158
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,000
This is not a pepper in there.

159
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The garlic, the onion.

160
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,099
Now, there is a little bit of chili in there, some salt and pepper, but it's not too spicy.

161
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:05,700
I promise.

162
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,900
We're probably at about a two or three on a 1 to 10 scale.

163
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,300
Okay.

164
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,500
Now I am going to check my chicken.

165
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,800
Give it a little stir.

166
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,000
Make sure that's heating up.

167
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,500
I see some steam coming out of there.

168
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,599
So I know it's doing what it's supposed to do.

169
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,099
Again, that chicken is fully cooked.

170
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,900
So I know that all I have to do is get it warm.

171
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,700
All right.

172
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
I am going to go ahead and pull my Stakeout.

173
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,200
Looks.

174
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,700
I love good.

175
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,100
Caramelization on both sides.

176
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,400
I am gonna let that rest.

177
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,900
We nearly didn't need to cook it for long since fully cooked.

178
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,500
And now I am going to put my pork carnitas in that same pan.

179
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:58,200
There's already enough residual fat from the stake, plus the Carnitas themselves are cooked and a delicious aromatic flat.

180
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,000
So we don't, we don't need to add anymore.

181
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,800
It's going to do what it needs to do in this pan.

182
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,400
Give another saute on these.

183
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,000
Flip of the saute pan on these mushrooms.

184
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,000
Got my steak resting.

185
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,900
My Carnitas a pop in here.

186
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:24,500
I have my chicken tinga heating up, and if I am a plant-based, I have carrots and squash in the oven.

187
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,400
Now.

188
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,500
I am going to slow her down.

189
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,600
Let my Carnitas pop and cook.

190
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:34,600
I am gonna put my mushroom pan on very low, and I am going to check in and make sure everyone.

191
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,100
MK, would you not put the Carnitas in the pan?

192
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,900
The mushrooms were in because you should not have both.

193
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,300
Yes.

194
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,700
The one that steak was in.

195
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,200
So pull out that stage.

196
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Let it rest Carnitas go into that pan.

197
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:56,900
That is correct.

198
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,300
Rachel.

199
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,900
That is correct.

200
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,500
M'Kay.

201
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,600
You are good MK.

202
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,200
I am curious.

203
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,400
You have mushrooms in your kit.

204
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,100
Okay, good.

205
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,900
So that's why I would have been confused too.

206
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,500
Okay.

207
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,300
So the next thing I am going to do is I am going to start to grab my tortillas, and we have sent you a lot of tortillas.

208
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:26,500
This Taco kit makes 12 different tacos for of three different kinds of finding out how you want to build them.

209
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:36,500
Now, if you aren't going to eat 12 tacos tonight, what I would do, little Pro tip, the save about half of your tortillas and eat them maybe with breakfast.

210
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:46,100
Bones, some of you, especially the Texans may know what breakfast tacos are you, you few people in California.

211
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,700
There are a lot like breakfast burritos, but smaller the burritos aren't really a real thing.

212
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,600
So yeah, 12 Spencer.

213
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,900
I am eating 12 to, I am right there with you.

214
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,400
All right.

215
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,300
I am going back to my stovetop.

216
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
My Carnitas have been going for about 2 minutes.

217
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,300
I am going to give them a flip.

218
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,500
Look at that.

219
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,800
Have caramelization.

220
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,100
I have crispiness.

221
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,900
That is exactly what we want.

222
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,000
I am going to drop for tortillas on my flat top or my go Mal.

223
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,300
I am going to check my oven.

224
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,300
You know, I am going to turn my oven off because I know.

225
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,200
That my veggies are done and they look awesome.

226
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,300
I see some delicious.

227
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,600
I have a delicious Aroma.

228
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,300
There's some steam coming off of them, and I am now heating up tortillas.

229
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:51,400
Alright, the next thing I am going to do is I am going to lower my heat of my Carnitas to a very low.

230
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:59,300
Now, I have everything on low heat except for my tortilla and my chicken, which I have on a medium heat.

231
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,400
I have turned off my oven.

232
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,600
Okay, we have gotten through the hard part.

233
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,300
We have gotten through the cooking part.

234
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,400
Let me heat up a few more tortillas, and we're going to start doing the garnishes.

235
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,000
I am going to slow down, just slow it down just a bit.

236
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,800
See where everyone is.

237
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,000
There're any questions that need to be answered Eileen.

238
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,500
Look at that.

239
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,800
That looks amazing.

240
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:21,800
Breakfast.

241
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,500
Tacos on the bottom.

242
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,300
That is correct.

243
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,700
And okay.

244
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,600
Where do you live now?

245
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:35,100
Actually, if you have your sous chef working for you, smart, that's what we do to.

246
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,700
Wow.

247
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,800
You just went for it.

248
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,800
Andrew from Dallas, okay, in case oh, you know, you know about breakfast tacos.

249
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,200
Okay, I am going to bring my steak over got my chicken over.

250
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,600
I am flipping.

251
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,400
Tortillas that's going.

252
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,000
Well.

253
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I have got my veggies.

254
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,200
I have got my mushrooms, right?

255
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,600
We're on the same page.

256
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:10,500
I am going to go ahead, and we have my tortillas this first round of tortillas is hot, which is awesome.

257
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,100
I am gonna put them in my tortilla warmer.

258
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,400
Remember if you don't have a tortilla warmer and you just have some linen, that works very well.

259
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
What's happened is that linen?

260
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,400
The steaming of that is going to continue to cook the tortillas.

261
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,100
Alright.

262
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,400
Now, we're going to build our Taco plate.

263
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,700
Does anybody have any questions before we start going on this mise en place?

264
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes.

265
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,000
How do we save the tortillas?

266
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,300
Good question.

267
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:55,800
I would keep some of this parchment paper that we have between them and if we're just going to save him for a day or two just put them into like a nice pork side, zip lock bag and kind of just try to get most of the air out of there.

268
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,200
The less air or oxygen in the packaging, the better.

269
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,600
If you don't have a Ziploc bag that these will fit in, it's best to keep them flat.

270
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,700
Just use some plastic wrap and wrap them very tightly, then put them in the refrigerator.

271
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,300
You want to save them in the refrigerator.

272
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,700
All right.

273
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,800
So before this meat or veggies get cold.

274
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,700
I want to start building out my taco plate.

275
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,100
First things first.

276
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:24,600
We have this oaxacan Cassio, this cheese that is made for us, in Oaxaca by a family that's been making the cheese for generations.

277
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,700
And you may see a hawk and queso in the grocery store and the markets.

278
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,200
But I guarantee you, when I can say this with complete certainty, none of it tastes like this.

279
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Mrs. The most delicious.

280
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:47,000
Well, how can Castle you Had I promise next, I am going to open up our chili Diablo, which is a grilled.

281
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,700
Jalapeño.

282
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,800
I am going to leave mine.

283
00:23:51,400 --> 00:24:03,000
Well, you may leave your toll because I like to do is take a bite of my taco and then take a bite of my pepper, but you can also cut it into an aha, which is the shape of roasted peppers like this.

284
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,400
When you come this way, put that right in the middle.

285
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,000
Next.

286
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,500
I am gonna open up my schnee pack which are these pickled onions.

287
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,600
These are pickled, the red onions that are pickled with habanero.

288
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,600
So there's a little more heat to this element.

289
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,100
There's some fresh garlic and Mexican oregano in there.

290
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,100
These are delicious.

291
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,700
Addition.

292
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,800
Next, I am going to open up my avocado.

293
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,900
Texans.

294
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,100
The avocados and Texas are out of season.

295
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
So these are California, avocados.

296
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,700
Thank you, California.

297
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,600
I don't know what you would do with avocado without avocados.

298
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,100
I don't know what I would do without our kados.

299
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,800
You're welcome.

300
00:24:50,600 --> 00:25:00,900
All right, I am gonna put take a spoon, and I am going to just four separate this from the skin like to do that and kind of flip it over, and we will show you a fun little trick here.

301
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,900
So you do that, do the same with the next avocado.

302
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,800
Just take your spoon kind of scoop it out.

303
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,700
Like so, flip it over.

304
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,100
Now.

305
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,100
You have two nice habit, avocados, right?

306
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
I am going to take my chef knife.

307
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:26,500
And I am just going to slice them like this if your knife sharp and you can move your knife pretty quickly on this go in and out like that.

308
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:38,100
And then I am going to take my hand and go like this and create this little avocado spread here, which looks really beautiful on the plate like this.

309
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,400
And that is a trick that's pretty easy to do.

310
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,100
If you try a few times.

311
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,000
I am only going to do half my avocado to start, getting to the next piece later.

312
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,600
I have some of that charred onion.

313
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,600
We were talking about earlier from the farm.

314
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,600
I like to put that right next to my grilled.

315
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,800
Jalapeño.

316
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,500
I will take my fresh cilantro.

317
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,300
If you see, I am kind of building everything on one side of the plate right now.

318
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,800
That's intentional.

319
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:22,000
We will take some of my mold own salt, give it a little sprinkle of the over the avocado because we love salty avocado, and we cut some lime wedges.

320
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,800
Just cut them.

321
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:30,800
However, you want the build some more of the plate with my line, like so right?

322
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,500
Okay.

323
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,600
My steak is rested.

324
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,700
It's still warm.

325
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,100
My chicken is still in the pot on the stove.

326
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,700
So I know that's warm by Carnitas are on very low heat, then their cast iron pan getting nice and crispy.

327
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:52,400
So I know those are warm if you have, if you have veggies, and they were still in your hot cookie tray.

328
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,800
We can go ahead and start placing your veggies here like to do is the mush mushrooms here.

329
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,300
Maybe the squash, the carrots.

330
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,800
Okay, let us go back to the stake.

331
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,500
If you see here, I am slicing Against the Grain.

332
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,200
You can see that national natural thread Asian of grain of the meat.

333
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:19,200
If you slice against it, you will get a month, tender much more tender bite of meat and if you see this should be cooked.

334
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,900
It's nice and crispy on the outside and cook to a perfect medium-rare medium.

335
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,600
Say that again.

336
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,000
I was fully cooked when you got it.

337
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,600
We're just heating.

338
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,300
It's Ruth.

339
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,700
I am gonna grab some carnitas when we put these on the plate as well.

340
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,900
These have gotten crispy textured.

341
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,000
They're so anxious and flavor.

342
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,600
You see little pockets of fattiness.

343
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,600
And then I am going to take my chicken tinga.

344
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,600
Because with an adobo Pepper marinade that will put that right here.

345
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:03,700
Now.

346
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,800
I have all my proteins.

347
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:14,900
Maybe you have all your veggies on your plate like, so I would go ahead and stick your finger in there and get a little case because it's so delicious.

348
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,500
I am gonna go to my last few ingredients.

349
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:29,200
All right, I have some of these Market vegetables, which are also grown in a local Farm, not the food force that you saw on the video.

350
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,300
These are grown at government Acres.

351
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,900
Then I am going to slice my radish.

352
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,800
You may have radish, you might have turnips.

353
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,000
Maybe Abby.

354
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,300
It's all seasonal.

355
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,400
All depends on which Farm.

356
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,100
It's coming from might have carrots.

357
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,900
They might be yellow.

358
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:52,700
The might be, or I am just going to use these to garnish here because I know when I built my tacos.

359
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,800
I like to have this fresh peppery crunch of radish.

360
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,200
Maybe this fresh crisp, textured of carrot.

361
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,200
So I am going to slice these really thin.

362
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:18,400
On a bias like, so, If these Cuts aren't available to totally cool, you can do a die, you can do a julienne.

363
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,800
You can take a mandolin and slice them really thin.

364
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,200
If you have one of those at home, let me again, I am just building.

365
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,500
I am building the taco plate.

366
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,100
I want to eat.

367
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,400
I am thinking about putting meat in my tortilla or vegetables.

368
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,100
Maybe some cheese, some jalapeno, some avocado.

369
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Some of these, nice fresh crisp vegetables.

370
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:50,700
I am gonna take I was might have my lime wedge that have this package of fresh beautiful herbs, and we're just going to garnish more of our plate with these.

371
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:59,200
You may have some chrysanthemums flower, maybe some diaphanous.

372
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,100
I have here some kale Leaf.

373
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,700
You might have mirror gold.

374
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:14,100
Everyone has something a little bit different, and I am just putting those beautiful garnishes on my plate.

375
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,100
I have already put my smoke.

376
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,700
Fresno, salsa into one.

377
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,700
My Verde sauce into another.

378
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,700
Your avocado didn't go like that actually.

379
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,100
That's alright.

380
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,700
You will do it again.

381
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,000
Your avocado money Bells.

382
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,600
Perfect.

383
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,300
Awesome.

384
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,900
Cool.

385
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,100
I have my tortillas my salsa verde, which is made with tomatillo.

386
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:52,100
It's also made with some aromatics and garlic and onions, how the finial, sodano then we have our smoked Fresno.

387
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,500
Salsa.

388
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,900
Make the to Fresno pepper.

389
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,100
Grilled tomatoes.

390
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,500
How's everyone else deal with their taco place?

391
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
Are they coming along?

392
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,500
If so, I would love to build a taco with you.

393
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,800
Anyone want to build a taco with me?

394
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
All right, I am gonna grab one tortilla.

395
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,600
We're going to build a taco then we're going to go into our taco party lounges, right?

396
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,400
All right, Elizabeth looking hyped up.

397
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,200
Danielle Ashley.

398
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,000
Hello.

399
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,000
Actually, your avocado didn't go this way.

400
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,000
Yeah, so my avocado doesn't look anything like that.

401
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,200
I will give you some footage here.

402
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,100
You can 300 pretty close.

403
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,700
That's what do you think?

404
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,400
It's close?

405
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:22,900
You did a much better job, but I definitely don't think it has some work to disclosure.

406
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,900
I browser working on a sushi restaurant.

407
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,600
So we have done a lot of that I did too.

408
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,700
So that's even more embarrassing like with the plastic wrap on the top of the Dragon Roll.

409
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,100
Yeah.

410
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,600
Yeah, right.

411
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,500
Never for me is what we're learning.

412
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,600
Thoughts of well, I like the effort.

413
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,700
How's yours?

414
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,800
Come out Elizabeth.

415
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,200

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,200
This Con Neal not slide.

417
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,100
You know.

418
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,300
This stays just came off.

419
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:05,400
So I am running a little behind but this is awesome.

420
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,400
Maybe you're going a little fast, but you have everything hot.

421
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,900
It looks like your everything ready to go.

422
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,000
It's all going to come together and have been a delicious Taco hard to you.

423
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,700
All right, I am gonna go out and have my first taco from then.

424
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:28,000
We're going to go into our taco party lounges, but anybody who's available to make their Taco now as well.

425
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,000
Let us go ahead and have a bite a toast, a taco toast, if you will.

426
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,600
Oh, yes material, that looks awesome.

427
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,700
Aaron.

428
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,700
That was great.

429
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,500
What's up, bro?

430
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,300
Stock of you build.

431
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,500
I built carnitas.

432
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:09,000
Did you guys build the charger Carnitas and somebody build their veggie tacos, or they love those?

433
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,800
What's a salsa that you like on that?

434
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,500
I like to smoke.

435
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:21,900
Fresno with my car meet this, the red one, put in the chat, your favorite salsa, red or green?

436
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,000
That's a very good point.

437
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,500
Spencer.

438
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,600
You don't need this first.

439
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,000
You're not going to anything else.

440
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,900
We got green red all day.

441
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,900
Verde green.

442
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,199
Yes.

443
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:34,800
Yes.

444
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,500
Yeah, the red is so Smoky, right?

445
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,000
That smokes.

446
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,600
Fresno.

447
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,000
Hmm.

448
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,300
Save some tortillas for your breakfast tacos.

449
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,800
That red salsa goes so good with eggs.

450
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,600
All right, so we're going to move to the taco party Lounge.

12
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,800
And Dave car is going to be joining us here on stage in a moment.

We're going to dive into a lot of these questions towards the end of our time for today.

18
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,500
Now, I saw a poll that we threw up here in a moment.

19
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,299
And before we bring up that pole, let me introduce Dave because I need to find out from Dave.

Great, great to have you here.

31

We're bringing all the stuff.

32
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:29,400
It's such a timely topic, is what I have been spending so much my own time thinking about both internally at lattice and then you're also working with our customers and folks, in the industry.

33
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,300
Yeah.

34
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,600
Yeah.

35
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Well, thank you for making time.

36
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,000
I know that we linked up a couple weeks ago about this event and you were like, right on, let us get after it.

37
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,900
And we were just riffing.

38
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,600
And so this is going to be a lot of that, that conversation.

39
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,600
We're going to be pulling out like, what are we learning?

40
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:53,500
You know, in the space and you guys being on the front lines of driving Employee Engagement as a company.

41
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,900
I know that you guys are investing a lot of work.

42
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:03,300
Not just to enable and equipped the industry and leaders, but also internally, right for your organization.

43
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,200
And so would love to cover both of those sides.

44
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,800
I will before we do that though.

45
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,400
Let us go ahead and bring that pole on stage about the favorite holiday, drink looks like hot.

46
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Chocolate is the winner here.

47
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,000
Dave.

48
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,400
What would you have voted here?

49
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,300
I voted for eggnog.

50
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,400
I am for me.

51
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,000
It's like not.

52
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,300
I feel like I can get hot chocolate.

53
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,700
Any time of the year, but eggnog.

54
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,300
That's right.

55
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,100
This is true.

56
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,400
This is true is funny because I have my warm drink here.

57
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,700
It looks like Starbucks.

58
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,800
Skip Thanksgiving and went straight to Christmas, but my vote here and it looks like it's starting to Trend up go.

59
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,500
Keitel is coming right behind egg.

60
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,400
Not I am in Puerto Rico right now.

61
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,700
Uncle Keitel is a Puerto Rican, coconut.

62
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,900
Nog, and it's fantastic and it has a little bit of spice in it.

63
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,900
That gets you sort of ready for the holiday conversations as well.

64
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,300
So if you haven't tried that, go ahead and give that a shot.

65
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,800
My team was laughing at me because I have never had hot toddy.

66
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Now is s in my alone in that Dave.

67
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,100
Do you know what hot toddy is?

68
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,500
I feel like I have had it.

69
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
I can't remember.

70
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,600
Where is it sort of like a mulled wine or like a mule or something?

71
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,000
I have, I have no idea, but folks would have to educate Us in chat at some point, but it's not.

72
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,000
I am gonna have to try it.

73
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,500
I am at the try.

74
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,000
So, I will try hot toddy.

75
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,500
You guys try coquito this holiday season, and I think we will be good to go.

76
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,800
Alright, alright, so now, pull number two.

77
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,500
Let us bring phone number two on stage.

78
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,200
This one's actually going to help us drive conversation here.

79
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,900
So what is for the audience?

80
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:51,300
What is your biggest priority right now, when it comes to employees and there's a lot of different things here, right?

81
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,200
Employee Engagement is a retention.

82
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,700
Is it Talent acquisition?

83
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,500
Is it d?

84
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,000
E and I am belonging.

85
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:04,800
Is it Learning and Development go ahead and place your vote by clicking directly on the stage because this is going to help guide the conversation, right?

86
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:14,300
Dave you and I can go into a lot of these different Pockets, but it's important that we actually speak to what people are looking for here as well.

87
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,100
Okay.

88
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,300
All right.

89
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,600
Looks like Employee Engagement is the front-runner here?

90
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,700
And, you know, under Employee Engagement like Dave.

91
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,100
Okay, you help us understand that, right?

92
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:34,600
From a lattice perspective, Employee Engagement seems to have its, there's a lot of things that go underneath that.

93
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,700
How would you, how do you define Employee Engagement from a lattice perspective just to level set the conversation?

94
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,600
Yeah.

95
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:54,100
I mean, I think fundamentally I think about engagement as Being defined our, how much are people committed to staying at the company and really willing to give everything.

96
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,700
They have to the group effort.

97
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,200
But how does that created through a whole range of things?

98
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,400
I think belonging is at the center of it, and we have seen that in the data over time.

99
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:13,500
I have seen it both at the companies that I have worked at, and we look at customers and work with them.

100
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:24,000
Someone's, like, Just fundamental understanding of hey, is this a place where I am part of the team where I have a future is just core driver of that.

101
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,300
Yeah.

102
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,900
Yeah, you know, I resonate with so much of that, you know, leading the charge here.

103
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:44,700
Welcome top of mind for me is, you know, our people, we treat our people, good to help us, hit the milestones, we need as an organization, but it's a hard thing to do to really know the heartbeat of your people.

104
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:44,900
Whoa.

105
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,900
Quarter by quarter week by week, especially in this, in this current sort of situation that were in today.

106
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,500
Where, you know, like we're all like from a society perspective.

107
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,800
We have been hit hard over the last two years, and we're learning new ways of working.

108
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,700
We're trying to navigate, you know, all these different things.

109
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:16,700
And, so I would imagine even lattice as a company is supporting companies in very tangible Ways by the tools and such that you offer.

110
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,600
You know, not, I don't want to make this infomercial, but I do know the power behind the platform because it's amazing.

111
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
So, yeah, thank you for leading the charge there, on that front.

112
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:35,000
But yeah, what's your when you think about the conditions of Employee Engagement given to certain landscape that were in today?

113
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:46,500
However, you saw the shift and leaders before covet and now during and going to post, covid-19 been the shift there on the investment, on employee engagement.

114
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,800
Ain't ya.

115
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,900
So it's I think definitely really top of mind and I think we have seen it in our own recent surveys.

116
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:03,200
How much it shot up the priority, you know stack ranking of for HR leaders.

117
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,800
I think you know, you go back obviously to a year ago.

118
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:16,900
Everyone was thinking about just even job stability and how do I how to whether through this downturn and recession and it's obviously changed.

119
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,100
Changed huge amount.

120
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:26,000
I think we have seen things shift from pre covid environment, which is also really pretty hot labor market.

121
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:42,600
One is that everyone is figuring out their hybrid model and as much as we're to all talking about attrition right now and the risk of it, like there's a lot of companies that when they have their final actual.

122
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,100
Okay.

123
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:50,800
Now you're supposed to return to the office date whether that's At the end of this year or, you know, various companies have kept pushing it out.

124
00:15:51,300 --> 00:16:01,000
It's La, I think a real Reckoning as some of those approaches that are lower on the flexibility Spectrum.

125
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,500
We're going to are going to run into reality.

126
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:11,600
And so there's going to be also a whole I think wave of attrition that comes out of that for companies to yeah, no doubt.

127
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,100
No doubt, you know, this was interesting and it's just a fascinating time.

128
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,400
We're in, we're from Work.

129
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:24,800
It's been normalized over the last 18 months because we have seen the world continue and still give people the flexibility.

130
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,400
They were looking for to live where they love and love where they live and vice versa and still get the job done.

131
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:39,100
And, so I agree is going to be really interesting to see, you know, the next couple of years as companies are grappling with the right policy, the right flexibility.

132
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:51,400
And we're going to get into that because I know that you guys have are going through that yourself, and we have our own perspective as well, and we will Dive In Before we do that, let us go ahead and talk about the state of people report.

133
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,900
You know, you guys put together a survey and you serve it over 700 HR professionals, right?

134
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:03,900
Click at 2021 Rapport and it offers a lot of different insights what?

135
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,900
We're going to be pulling some of those insights on to the stage to help anchor and inform Us in the conversation.

136
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,700
Me included.

137
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,700
I selfishly in love these conversations guy.

138
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,400
Get to learn from some of the best people, right?

139
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,800
And the findings that they have.

140
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,300
So let us go ahead and bring one of those stats on stage.

141
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,900
It's shows.

142
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,500
Absolutely.

143
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah, one of the biggest perks of becoming a lattice employee for me was getting early access to the results coming out of these surveys.

144
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's been so helpful communion and doing my own 2020 planning, 2022 planning.

145
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,900
Yeah, no doubt.

146
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,100
So let us bring some of those insights to the stage, so we can actually have a conversation around it.

147
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:52,400
You know, it seems like more than half of respondents saw an it's in the poori departures over the last few months and it's tea and up a little bit of what you're saying.

148
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,100
Right.

149
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,000
Which is policies are starting to be rolled out.

150
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,100
People have changed human behavior change the way they do things.

151
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,800
Like for me personally.

152
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
I have a little girl.

153
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,600
She's she just turned to.

154
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,200
I saw her grow up throughout this pandemic.

155
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,700
Like I am here in the office and then I can go and see her first step.

156
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Those things.

157
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,800
You can't put a value on and it's going to be interesting to see how these things continue to.

158
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,700
You to drive forward now.

159
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:28,000
What do you think is the main cause for folksy and his level of quote-unquote?

160
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,300
Greg's resignation now as opposed, to when the formal policies come out?

161
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,000
Do you feel like some of these policies are starting to hit some of these companies now, and people are reacting to that?

162
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I think that's one aspect of it for sure.

163
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,400
I think that there's an interesting mix, both of some like, real enduring factors.

164
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:58,200
Like we look at it and a lot of the drivers come back down to things that we know are really important.

165
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,400
What's my career development?

166
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,100
Like whose my manager?

167
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,700
What sort of connections do I have with, with my co-workers?

168
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,700
So there's a whole range of things that are actually.

169
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:17,400
We really consistent from what we would have seen 12 or call, you know, 24 months ago.

170
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,600
I think what's new is and I think you spoke to it there.

171
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:22,900
Right?

172
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:32,800
Like you have had this like really personal experience with your family and how that's affected you.

173
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,500
I have gone through some things like that.

174
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:43,900
Myself just being able to spend some time with a couple of parents who are getting older that you know, maybe pre covid.

175
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:51,300
I wouldn't have been able to spend so much time with people are we considering a lot of Life priorities?

176
00:19:51,300 --> 00:20:01,900
And so that's shifting how much Focus people are putting on sort of holistic wellness, and how am I feeling supported and how companies that respond that?

177
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,100
No doubt, no doubt and just being remote.

178
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,400
It makes things a little bit more complicated, right?

179
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,300
As a leader.

180
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:22,200
You're not really getting the face of face, the walk around the office, and kind of see that this person that was always eating in this area is no longer there.

181
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,500
So you want to just check up on that individual.

182
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:30,700
A lot of that goes unseen, which means that we have to be even more intentional, right?

183
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,300
As leaders.

184
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:36,100
And as companies to Car people write the perks of, you know what?

185
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,900
I was back at Google.

186
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:43,700
The Perks of like the massage table or the snacks and the micro kitchen, or the scooters to like, get around.

187
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:50,600
The campus are no longer going to be the things that keep your people hooked into the company.

188
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:59,900
What are you seeing, like, even in the early stages of companies and what they're trying to do to invest and their culture remotely.

189
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,000
Yeah.

190
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,100
It's been something that we have fermented with a lot.

191
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:13,600
I think that it's impossible to go into this and just know exactly how it's supposed to be done and how it will work best in your own company.

192
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:24,700
I think the thing is that I am seeing one is just getting away from just really generic virtual happy hour, big, big group and figuring out.

193
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,400
How do you get participation?

194
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,100
Either it in that larger setting internally.

195
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,100
We are all about the chat and being really Lively and active.

196
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:43,600
They're breaking out in small groups, mixing, different ways of engaging and then how do you break it down?

197
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:57,600
So at one point you just said, I look, we are done with virtual happy hours, just basically like ban them and let us to take all of that energy and invest it in creating.

198
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,900
Small group events for teams and cross-functional partners.

199
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:08,000
And let us get 5 or 10 people together and do a really cool event for them, where they can, they can engage with, with each other.

200
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,400
Mmm.

201
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:16,300
So, I think those are the, those are the things that we have had great reaction on and get people dancing.

202
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:16,800
Yeah.

203
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,700
That she has to, like, actually build a connection with each other.

204
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,600
Yeah, now, I love that.

205
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,500
I love that and date.

206
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,400
I promise, guys.

207
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:36,400
I did not pay Dave to say that we are, you know, for us, that's what we drive, you know, welcome drives these different type of experiences vary, whether its high production like this or small groups who are wood and what have you.

208
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:49,900
And what we're seeing just to speak on, like the patterns that we're seeing on our side, we're seeing exactly that right companies are saying that, you know, the things that we're first, first of all, we have taken this approach.

209
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,200
Where will use to do in the room like, in office in person environment?

210
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,300
We're trying to replicate that in the virtual environment.

211
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:06,200
And that's where we get in trouble versus saying, you know what, we're going to take a remote first approach and say what is really an engaging experience.

212
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:13,100
Is it really just bringing people into a gallery of all of our faces from meeting to meeting immediately meeting?

213
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:19,700
And then we're going to try to inject an experience or do we take a remote first approach and say You know what?

214
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:33,100
We're going to actually change it up quite a bit and do things that were not even possible to do in the real world because now we're in the, in the remote world, and we can do things that were not possible.

215
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,800
Easy for some companies to get you, get caught on the wrong side of this, to where it was getting me.

216
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:49,000
A lot of companies who are trying to add in a little bit of flexibility and one or two days a week from home or a couple of remote people and our understanding.

217
00:23:49,100 --> 00:24:15,500
Are estimating, still what that means when you put it all together, when you have 10% remote and a bunch of other people that you will still need to be operating with much at different norms, and communication Styles and ways of engaging because you will come into the office, even though you think that you're mostly in office and you're going to have half the people dialing in.

218
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,800
And so it's just going to drive a lot of different engagement there.

219
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:27,400
No doubt and that's sort of like drives a good segue into like a remote and hybrid work challenges, right?

220
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
I think that.

221
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,900
I mean, you're starting to peel back.

222
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:36,900
What could be like an entire for our conversations, and we can make turned it into a conference to talk about the learnings.

223
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:45,900
But really, that's what it is, is really learning and iterating, you know, in our conversation before we came on stage.

224
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:54,600
We're talking about how lattice had a plan and say, you know what, After certain amount of months, we're going to bring people back to the office and then this and then Delta came.

225
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,700
And then what were some of those learnings for you?

226
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,900
I mean, you're sitting, you're sitting with leaders at ladders, you're saying, okay, like let us figure this out.

227
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,500
Let us roll it out.

228
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,600
But what's the power of iteration and learning in that?

229
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,500
Oh, yeah.

230
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,500
We had the perfect plan.

231
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:24,500
It was, it was all, it was all baked out, and we had the, we had the five-page FAQ Dock, and it was all very Like well organized, it was all going to be our people come in on these days.

232
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,900
And this is what it's going to look like.

233
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,600
We rolled it out before any of us actually set foot in the office again.

234
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,200
And as soon as we did, I mean, even all of us who debated it and written it up.

235
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Like, I don't know.

236
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,500
I feel different about some of this stuff than I thought.

237
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:42,900
I would.

238
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:49,400
Like, I thought I was a really want this person and actually turns out I want more flexibility or these challenges.

239
00:25:49,500 --> 00:26:00,700
We thought that the one that always comes to mind is we have no meeting Wednesdays and yeah, so we And this out and Wednesday, we're going to do two days at home.

240
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,500
Wednesday was going to be one of those days.

241
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,600
So everyone could do the focus work.

242
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,600
It turned out.

243
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:18,500
It was the complete opposite as soon as we opened up the office, optimally, everyone came in Wednesday's because they didn't have meetings, and they wanted to actually be able to engage with each other and that made total sense expensive.

244
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:28,300
But It was the come on, what we thought and then Delta came and the combination of those things.

245
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:38,400
I think we have been doing a lot of real-time surveying like rolling pulse engagement surveys and Delta hit the next week on.

246
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,400
We had a question around like I agree with my company's approach.

247
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,400
On, on some hybrid related things.

248
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:55,300
We saw it felt fall 30 points in a week after Delta really, really took shape there and wow.

249
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,700
It was the dinner for us to say.

250
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,800
All right, we gotta do this over.

251
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,100
We came our and said, hey, we did this too early.

252
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:10,000
So we're going to put everything back on the table, and we're gonna, we're going to bring you along on the journey with us.

253
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,400
We're not going to, we won't have the 10-page, FAQ doc, ready.

254
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,000
And so know that there's going to be uncertainty but it's not.

255
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,600
Is right now hiding it like there're just things we don't know yet.

256
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:31,200
And here's how we're going to go through this Wireless together and that really, I think you built those with people and helped us help.

257
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,100
Just kind of bring people Along on that on the journey with us.

258
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Now Dave what do you think like lattice folks in general?

259
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,300
Are you guys going to see folks?

260
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:50,300
I stay remote or you guys always going to require two days or where's the current thinking that way right now?

261
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:04,900
Yeah, and I think everyone says they're you know, doing or so many people say they're doing hybrid and the no never defines what that is and you really do have to break it down to in the what's hybrid.

262
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:15,500
Of your in commuting distance of the office and you're coming in sometimes and not coming in sometimes and then what's remote.

263
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,500
And you know, and your part of a bigger organization that isn't necessarily all remote.

264
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:34,800
The way we are approaching it now is really trying to get often down more to the team by team level and allowing for a fair amount of flexibility in individual.

265
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:46,300
Um, so take like our engineering organization and our Tech teams, they will have a pod that is focused on this part of the product that will be default.

266
00:28:46,300 --> 00:29:02,800
Remote, people know if the joining that pod that team operates with total like remote first, mindset and norms, and they will be another pod that, hey, it's people, that actually like that, that office collaboration, and they will come in one or two days a week and be within commuting distance.

267
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,900
The thing that we were figuring out now.

268
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:15,100
Next is when and how do we do the virtual events in a way that's engaging for a hybrid team?

269
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,000
And when and how do we bring people together in person?

270
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:28,700
We're talking about both a like january/february big virtual kickoff and then also possibly bring all of the company together.

271
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:34,900
Like once in person later in the yeah really, you know, some of the in-person connection.

272
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:57,300
It's, you know, was mind-boggling day is that, who would have thought 24 months ago that every company across the world is thinking about these things and that remote is normalized and that people can work from home and companies are like, yeah, maybe you can just come to the office once a week.

273
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,100
Like, it's a complete s***, 24 months later.

274
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,900
We're living in a place where we're putting employees first, and we're saying that.

275
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,500
You know what, we can still get the job done, and we want to have flexibility.

276
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,900
But we also want these kind of things.

277
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,400
Now, these kind of things are the things that feel that are still evolving.

278
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:22,300
And we're learning from a business perspective, what they are and the example that you had, which was fantastic.

279
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:29,400
People came into to actually build connection with other peers on that Wednesday as opposed to a no meeting.

280
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,800
And it seems like that's a pattern that companies are taking where when folks do come together.

281
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,900
We want them to connect in ways that you can't do over screen.

282
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,300
And so for us, for instance, we gathered our entire company in person, and we focused on doing no screen time.

283
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,500
It was a couple days, and we said no screen time.

284
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,900
We're actually going to do things that are almost impossible to do remotely and build that relational Equity.

285
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,400
So that when we jump back on here, I am connected to date.

286
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,900
Because Dave and I we broke bread and I got to know him his story.

287
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:14,600
Re and we went on a walk and talk and it felt right and I think that's a pattern that we're seeing also company sake is that resonate with what you're seeing?

288
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,500
Definitely that I think getting much more intentional around?

289
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
What do we want to use this time?

290
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,600
Whether that's the in-person time or the virtual time?

291
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,400
What do we want to use it for?

292
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,800
And there is actually there's really good research that backs up exactly what you're saying.

293
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,900
A virtual team actually perform.

294
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,300
Much more highly.

295
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:47,000
If they have been able to meet even once in person and been able to go through some of that relationship building that they might not have been able to.

296
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:56,500
Otherwise, the other thing we're seeing and I spawned the chat, someone mentioned across functional scavenger hunt that they set up the cross.

297
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,100
Functional piece is really interesting.

298
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:30,000
There was actually there was a study that Microsoft actually just did and released in nature, they analyzed all of the like Communications and meetings that were happening when people went into a remote or hybrid in environment, what they found is that the total amount of communication stayed the same but it tended towards being much more within the team with a decline of lots of cross functional connections and communication.

299
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,600
It was something that we saw internally or even myself when I joined I am boarded in June.

300
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:55,800
So I was onboarding remotely as we're all still figuring it out now, and I am actually surprised how easily I could connect with other execs with, with my team with folks that I had the opportunity to work with a lot and repeatedly.

301
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:04,400
And when I realized I was missing is like hey that person that I don't have a specific reason to talk to, but maybe I would admit it.

302
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,300
The lunch table, right?

303
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:12,900
And like that's our bill is sort of cross-functional empathy, you know, somewhere else in the organization.

304
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,400
That's what's breaking down.

305
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,900
Yeah, and that's it.

306
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,900
I think, I think that's right.

307
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:38,000
I think that's a challenge even for us right at, welcome to we're 100% remote food to distribute it and I think it's those opportunities to see a new employee that, you know, joined two weeks ago and See him her walking down the hall and you're like, hey, you know what?

308
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,800
Let us have five minutes right now.

309
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,700
Let us just catch up and I want to hear your story.

310
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,800
And how was your week going?

311
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,300
And let us go for a coffee.

312
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:46,800
Right?

313
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,300
I think that those are the things that we have to figure out pretty quickly.

314
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,800
To continue to build that.

315
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:59,600
Every lease from Equity, that drives us segueing into creating a culture of belonging, right?

316
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,400
You T that up how important that is on the retention side?

317
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:19,400
How people would have feel Connected to not just a company but their co-workers we have a stat here from the report that says 43% of HR professionals here at that Employee Engagement was the number one top priority over the next 12 months.

318
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,800
It's true with like the folks that we surveyed here at this event as well.

319
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,100
It's like the top priority for folks.

320
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:33,199
Like how are you seeing folks boost retention in the current landscape, right?

321
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,400
We have this complexity of Figuring out hybrid and strategies.

322
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,199
What are you seeing some actual things that you are actually working?

323
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,500
Are you starting to see some patterns from this report?

324
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,199
And from your peers in the space?

325
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,300
Yeah.

326
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:55,500
So I think one of the big patterns is happening, I think there's a, there's been a real shift.

327
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:07,800
Unfortunately over the last six to nine months, of a lot of companies really actually D prioritizing d&i, and that was one of the changes that we saw between or last year's survey.

328
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:34,900
In this year's survey was, you know, I am falling really far down the agenda, both your business and HR leaders and I think that when you dig below a lot of times a headline stats around engagement and attrition what you realize underneath people having really different experiences and you know, like this is its something that I try and keep really like Forefront in my mind.

329
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:49,200
A white male, like I will have a certain experience, and a certain like, way that I see myself represented in around the company, and take signals from that around where I do, or don't belong.

330
00:35:49,200 --> 00:36:00,300
And so, if you're not thinking about these aspect, when you're approaching something like Employee Engagement, really going to be missing.

331
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:05,400
The reality of the, many different experiences that people are having.

332
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,600
So I think we're seeing a bit of a split where there is a subset of companies.

333
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:22,300
That is, he's keeping to unite as much higher on the priority list, and I think see those folks have greater success on the retention side.

334
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,500
Overall, as a result.

335
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,500
No doubt, I, you know I have to dig into that.

336
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:33,000
You open up a door that I am super passionate about almost to a default.

337
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:52,400
It's, it's, I am pretty bullish on the fact that remote work when done, well can lead to a richer culture, you know, diverse culture, but it doesn't mean that it's necessarily, just going to happen.

338
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Like, it's not Just going to happen.

339
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:10,200
Just because now you're a remote company, you're going to reap the benefits of that and build, a very inclusive culture and a culture that within the company that builds for the world because it is diverse.

340
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,100
What do you seeing the implications of that?

341
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:21,500
So we're going from 0, folks are putting when, when folks don't prioritize there's there're some problems with that.

342
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,600
Obviously, but also, what are the benefits?

343
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:33,100
That you're starting to see and what kind of intention is needed to diversify the workforce in this new landscape that we go stepping into.

344
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,300
I mean certainly really right in that it opens up a lot of opportunities.

345
00:37:38,300 --> 00:38:08,500
We spent a lot of time internally talking about our own location strategy and having our location and hybrid strategy, actually be an explicit part of how we plan to recruit and compete for talent and thinking about diversity as one of the specific and explicit aspects that we're considering if we're opening up a new office or recruiting in different locations and what teams were opening up to do remote first.

346
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,300
So I think it opens up a lot of opportunities.

347
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:17,200
I think you're totally right that the intentionality in this is critical that.

348
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:44,400
Yeah, I think, you know, we know that we're talking about unconscious bias that Is not something that just quickly or easily shift, you know, it's something that we have been saved our leader just companies working on in different ways for a long time and there will be ways that I think it opens up opportunities for more inclusivity.

349
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:53,300
I think there will be new challenges that we figure out to, you know, what happens when your hybrid.

350
00:38:53,700 --> 00:39:02,800
And you start to get say there's a fairly large actually demographic, breakdown on, who's coming into the office or spends more time in the office or not.

351
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,400
What might that lead to and how are you thinking about that?

352
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,800
Yeah, now yeah, it's a build the culture around that.

353
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,900
This is, I mean, this is a right on Deva.

354
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:24,500
I love that you're speaking on this because, you know, we talked about leveling the playing field, and we talked about providing Equitable experience.

355
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,500
What does that actually mean?

356
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:27,900
Right?

357
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:32,200
Like these are hot terms and it's like, yes, I am gonna do this and yes, we're going to do this.

358
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:42,700
What does that look like as we're stepping into remote first, you know, one of the things that, that I have been having some conversations about with other leaders around this way.

359
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,800
Thing to say that.

360
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,600
Exactly what your tea and up to say that, okay, we're going to level the playing field.

361
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,800
We're going to do remote, it gives us access, and we can provide more opportunity.

362
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:06,100
That means if you want to live in Puerto Rico and you want to work from Puerto Rico and like have a yard with your roosters and your chickens and your family's there, but you can still work for a fast-growing, Silicon Valley company, then you should be able to go do that.

363
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:18,800
Now that person shouldn't feel like there's an unfair Advantage between where they're sitting and the people that are in the office rubbing elbows with people and grabbing the Fee, with that leader, that's walking down the hall.

364
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,600
What?

365
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,300
What, goes through your mind and that challenge?

366
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:30,500
And I know I am not, and I am not asking for the right answer because I know we're all learning in this fast-changing environment.

367
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:37,700
But what goes through your mind in that from an equitable experience, for employees that are going to be remote, like, we're going to be hiring remote employees, right?

368
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:43,500
If you want to live in Alabama, or in Iowa or importer Rico, go ahead and do that.

369
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,800
But how do I work as a leader to make you feel?

370
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,700
Feel included and feel like the Plainfield, like your voice.

371
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:57,300
Is as loud as the loudest extrovert that sitting in the town hall?

372
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,500
In front of the executive.

373
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,000
What does that look like?

374
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah.

375
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:12,500
I think the two big things that we're trying to do one is that we're really explicitly treating remote as an office.

376
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:19,600
And so we got Seth is an office York is an office blending, his office and remote as an office and got it.

377
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
We have a site leader.

378
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:28,000
We're setting up a site leadership team in the same way that we think about annually, what's our benefit strategy.

379
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:37,600
For the UK versus the us, we're talking about what is our benefit strategy for remote and bring it in as a layer.

380
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,100
Anytime.

381
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,300
We're thinking about our employee value prop, our employee experience.

382
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:57,800
I think that creating the platform then have some of those leadership voices, will be really important and also being able to cut our engagement survey data and all of these other data points that we have.

383
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:08,700
And looking at that, that cut of it, the other OB this investing in person and being able, whether it's all at once?

384
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:20,400
Or basically, we take a lot of the money that we're saving potentially on off a space over the years really intentionally, bring that back into combination of employee travel.

385
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:26,600
Like and like the actual events and different ways of enabling that hybrid experience.

386
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,900
Fantastic, you know, I love it.

387
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,500
Looks like folks are resonating as well with remote as an office, right?

388
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,900
That's a simple framing, but it's important.

389
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,500
Like, if remote weren't office, who runs that office, who's driving the culture within that office.

390
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:50,700
How are we handling spaces for people to connect and engage with, in that office is super helpful?

391
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:57,000
Let us go ahead and segue into some Q&A and guys go ahead and start flooding.

392
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,800
The Q&A tab.

393
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,400
We want to hear your voice, and your questions won't bring that.

394
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,600
First question up on stage from Robin.

395
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,200
What are you most excited about in 2022?

396
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,000
Dave, who most excited about?

397
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,100
I mean, so there's so much.

398
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,400
I make, I am excited, but I will say, actually, the very biggest thing.

399
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:29,900
I mean I am excited about is Possibility of bringing the whole company together in, in person will be at like six or seven hundred people.

400
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,700
And as interesting window of time before we're too big to do it, but after a lot of, you know, we're still covid Z, /.

401
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,100
So I would say that.

402
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:39,300
Yeah.

403
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:40,800
Okay.

404
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:52,300
The other thing I would say is, we're coming out with a comp product and I have always been a comp geek and so just getting a chance to work with the teams.

405
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,900
Internally on like product division around that has been much fun.

406
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,800
Fantastic.

407
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,200
Okay, I will be looking out for that.

408
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,900
I think we all need more tools as people leaders.

409
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:18,700
You know, the Gathering of folks is pretty magical in person, when we had our people come together, like it felt like we have been together the entire time, like people connected.

410
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,000
I mean, they were tears.

411
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,300
It was like, there's a like, what is happening right now, but it was so much richer when we came back to be a remote.

412
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,200
So Yeah, you know, that struck me too.

413
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:42,400
I had actually a similar experience, it surprised me because I have been in the office a couple of you number of times before, but we had a, we had like a Halloween party.

414
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:55,600
Like I literally almost broke down in tears because there were all these people, I felt like I had worked with but was getting a chance to connect with on a deeper level and I realized how much I had.

415
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,400
I have been missing that like it's been Yeah, really, really long 1820.

416
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,200
So like we need those connections.

417
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,600
Now that no doubt.

418
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,100
Okay, cool.

419
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:10,900
So I am looking forward to that for you as well, and we will get our people together in year two at welcome.

420
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,900
Let us go ahead and bring up a question from Emily.

421
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:21,700
What if employees don't engage show up or the same people show up for the event?

422
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,000
Okay.

423
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:35,600
So I think the additional framing here is like right now, you know, we  thrown internal town halls or a prg event and like how Like, how are you seeing folks, engaging?

424
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,100
And what are you guys doing to bring that up?

425
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:50,100
Yeah, so I think, and I remember having this challenge actually before covid as well, you throw the, you know, the office happy hour and often the same 20 people would show up.

426
00:45:50,500 --> 00:46:06,900
I think you really understand the diversity of your employee base and what people are interested in and what's going to get them excited and the thing that's going to get, you know, the account, exactly excited actually problem.

427
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,600
May be really different from what's going to get some of the engineers excited.

428
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:21,400
So just I have really tried to embrace like a wide range of different types of events and then also empowering groups and teams.

429
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:32,600
So we have really upped our ERG budgets and empowerment of leadership since their able to do more events giving budgets and an environment to department leaders, all of that.

430
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:33,900
Bring more folks in.

431
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:45,800
No doubt, no doubt, you know it's interesting as I am getting more and more into the space because I am you know, we're obviously part of the space and tooling the space.

432
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,700
What we're finding is that urg groups not just is not just the right thing to do.

433
00:46:52,200 --> 00:47:00,000
In terms of representation making people feel like they belong, but is actually a big culture driver and people, feel empowered to say.

434
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,500
Yes, you have a budget.

435
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:01,900
Yes.

436
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:02,700
You have space.

437
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,900
Yes, please go do.

438
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,000
And you have executive support.

439
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,700
To go do that matters tremendously.

440
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,100
I am glad that you brought that up going to the second.

441
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,600
The third question here from Casey.

442
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:27,100
What do you recommend for folks who are feeling unhappy with their current work set up, you know, she's 100% remote right now, but don't know what our tentative solution would make them happier.

443
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,200
Yeah, I think.

444
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,100
It's going to depend on by individual.

445
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,800
I think it is probably getting to the root of it.

446
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,800
Like, is it, is it a company that is just not remote friendly, right?

447
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:54,000
Or is it hey that actually want to be, but they're struggling on how to build certain types of connections and operate in this new world.

448
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:08,400
I do think that there're some folks like I know a fair number of people that just Personally, our office folks, and they really prefer to work in an office.

449
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,000
And that's okay too.

450
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,800
And I think so mix of really understanding the company and knowing your own desires to figure out.

451
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,500
Hey, is this, is this a match long-term?

452
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,400
I mean, this goes back to what we were two talking about earlier.

453
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:29,400
There's gonna be a whole reshuffling of folks as each company moves into their model.

454
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,500
Opting in or opting out of that, that company based on it.

455
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,500
Yeah, you know, it's just a tough one as well.

456
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,400
I Casey I think that it's for some folks.

457
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,900
They're loving the remote for others.

458
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:58,900
It's like I love it, but I don't at times like it's like this love-hate relationship where like the I love the flexibility but I hate this actual room setup because it's super echoey and I don't have the nice coffee shop right down the street because I am in The Burbs.

459
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,700
And every time I used to go into SF, it was not only good.

460
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:10,400
For me to listen to my podcast decompressed but also engage with people and I think that's super important.

461
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,800
I have some team members, and we're going to be working in 2022.

462
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:34,400
The idea of PODS and saying that for cities in which we have a larger concentration of people, we're going to have like, these co-working spaces where people can drop in and go connect and even looking at like stipends to say, you know what, like, if you want to actually go to co-working, Space.

463
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,900
So you can get your fix with people and all of that we're going to be looking at ways to make that available.

464
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,600
And I think Dave, I think that companies would love to hear your thoughts on that companies.

465
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:49,600
Need to be thinking in that kind of way, for the cases of the world where it's like, hey, I am here.

466
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,800
I like it, but it's not optimal.

467
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,800
Something's not right.

468
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,600
Like what's your, what's your take on that?

469
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,000
Our people?

470
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:03,800
What you're hitting on there is something we hadn't thought of it internally, but I have been hearing it pop up, isn't it?

471
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:57,500
What?

472
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,100
Idea, and I love it of.

473
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:06,900
All right.

474
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,900
Look, what do we do?

475
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:16,600
We didn't open up an office in Atlanta, but it turns out now that we have 20 remote workers all in Atlanta.

476
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,600
Like, why are we missing that as an opportunity?

477
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:28,100
And, so I think, you know, yeah, or even our idea of whether or not, there's an office in a certain city will evolve.

478
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,300
Is it going to be more of a, more of a spectrum?

479
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,600
I think there are a lot of people who are looking at that.

480
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,400
Yeah, no doubt.

481
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:36,700
Are.

482
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:43,000
We got a last question here as we're coming in for a landing from Spencer was the most engaging employee experience.

483
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,200
You have been able to execute in a remote world or in your case, the remote office.

484
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,600
And how, how are you measuring impact of that?

485
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,900
Someone one we did.

486
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,700
This was it was so much fun.

487
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:05,300
So we set aside three hours and I think we have been doing some different more like social events.

488
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,900
And so we wanted to do something a bit different.

489
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:17,100
We'd also been talking about like ideas of conflict and decision-making and communication with, with the company.

490
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:40,100
So actually, we brought in a group and it was it Like a business case study that they turned actually into like a gamified climbing of Mount Everest with like a software that ran it and you went through a number of stages and you had to get to decide in each stage.

491
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:45,400
Like there were, you know, there were some quite problems to figure out there really judgment calls and ethics.

492
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:52,200
It was like this mix of things that You went through for about two hours and then, and we it was intense.

493
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:58,800
It was really surprisingly intense and like people really got into, we did this with and it was kind of in this idea.

494
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:05,200
We were talking about before we did this with cross-functional teams people that wouldn't normally be working together.

495
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:17,700
There's a way and people actually, like kept up some of the connections afterwards and it I think helped us have a broader conversation about then some really meaningful.

496
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:23,800
Ideas of conflict and collaboration that we were talking about while still being like really fun.

497
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,500
There's like both a lot of fun and engaging but had some real content people.

498
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:31,600
Amazing.

499
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:38,600
Yeah, you know, it's interesting you mention content and content is really important in driving these experiences.

500
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,100
Right?

501
00:52:39,100 --> 00:53:08,800
If you're delivering, your content is not relevant to what people are feeling sensing Desiring, then it's like you go get crickets pretty much regardless of what you do whatever magic show you put together, you know for us we have been able I remember one all hands where I did a poll survey and it was I was I was feeling like, you know, our people To connect because it feels like we're a lot of folks are sort of struggling with this like burnout and sort of the remote on screens meetings to meetings and meetings.

502
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,800

503
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,400
It was already booked on calendar.

00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,400
So that means that everybody's are coming.

505
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:21,600
So instead of like giving you a big company updating going through metrics and all these, if the things we say, you know what?

506
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:33,900
We're going to do an all-hands focus on self care, and we're gonna do it right now and this is what we're going to talk about, and we're going to go in groups and just have a conversation and Check in and do a heart check with each other as well.

507
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:47,500
And it was I think one of those riches and riches experiences, but it was drawn from a need and saying our employees need this and so therefore it's going to be relevant and relevance means right now, which means that we're going to skip this planned.

00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:55,200

36
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,500
So each of you has received the kit.

37
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,800
If you open up your kit and your kid, I am sure most of you have already opened your kits, but that's my experience.

38
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,600
At least, is that up to this point?

39
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
Everyone opened it, they want to see what's in the box, and they have already organized it.

40
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,600
That's great.

41
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,600
We're going to go through all those pieces, but first, I want to have a drink with you.

42
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,300
So I am going to use a rocks glass.

43
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,600
I have my RTD that's a little assembly slang that we have right there.

44
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,200
That is a ready to drink.

45
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:40,600
Margarita from of you have non-alcoholic version, which is my favorite version, but they're all delicious.

46
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,100
I have some lime salt.

47
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,600
So you do have a package of lime salt.

48
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,700
There are two packages of salt in your kit this evening.

49
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,300
The lime salt is the one we're going to use first.

50
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,900
Then I like to use a little plate so that I can Rim, my rocks glass.

51
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,600
And then I am going to use a line here.

52
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,700
To complete this whole process.

53
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,400
I have gotten some Iced Out.

54
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,000
And now we're going to begin making a drink.

55
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,599
And then we're going to have a toast first.

56
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,700
Let us go ahead and dump that line Salt right on there.

57
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,800
Next, I am going to take a little bit of this line because I am going to use this line throughout the evening.

58
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,200
I am going to run my glass like this.

59
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:33,000
Now, I am going to take the moisture from the lime juice and I Rim the rim with, and I am going to put it through the lime salt.

60
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,300
So I have myself here, a nice, beautiful rimmed glass.

61
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:38,900
Now.

62
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,700
Remember, this is two drinks worth.

63
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:50,800
Although, I am not going to judge you for how you drink your drinks, but I am going to put some ice in a rocks, glass saved my limes, salt, for my next dream.

64
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,400
Finish this drink, the pour about half of this in here.

65
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,800
Save the other half for later on in my meal, maybe even for dessert.

66
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:10,200
And there we have our Margarita the ready to drink made famous by our restaurant here.

67
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,600

68
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,300

This is actually kind of multi-course experience.

78
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,600
So while we have a drink in our hand, and we got our palate, nice and wet.

Or the top us to snack on, you know, for the 78 minutes.

84
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,500
We're in those breakout rooms, and we're gonna come back, and we're gonna cook our meal.

85
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,500
Okay, when we come back, it's going to go fast.

86
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,700
It's going to be fun right now.

87
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:34,900
Let us go ahead and let us pull out our bag of it says on there to topos which are our tips made of Masa, which is a corn flour that we grind every day from corn that we have sourced from different small farms in Mexico.

88
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,800
They come to us in the US.

89
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,500
Yes, we pay a premium for it.

90
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:54,300
That money goes right back into those small farms and in their communities, and then we have this delicious heirloom errant or Heritage corn that we see our process of mixed to Malaysian, which is a soaking calcifying process a little scientific.

91
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
It's pretty simple though, through that process.

92
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:03,800
We grind it into a corn flour, and then we make these chips, Ortho post, and I am going to pour those into a bowl.

93
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,800
So grab yourself a bowl, won't take long.

94
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,700

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,400
I like this for my salsa.

101
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:30,000
It's a perfect size, and I am going to put my salsa divorcee Otto's in there.

102
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,200
All right, just like so it's the only salsa that is in your kit.

110
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,000
And we're going to break out in this room to get to know each other a little bit.

111
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,100
Let me go ahead and walk you through that process.

112
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,400
I have separated the ingredients.

113
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,300
I have a bowl here.

114
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,700
This is going to be for our bean salad.

115
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:32,700
The ingredients that bean salad or A package of beans and hominy here in are compostable packaging of a package of Rebel tomatoes.

And that was just say herbs.

120

You also have a package of cilantro in your kit.

121
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,900
This is for a different part of the meal.

122
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,200
We're just using the herbs and there are two onions.

123
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,600
This is the Red Onion.

124
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,100
This is the ball.

125
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,000
I am going to serve it in.

126
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,500
I also need a mixing bowl.

127
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:13,300
Okay, that is The tools that I need for that being salad.

128
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,900
Next just so we get a little bit ahead.

129
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,500
I am going to walk you through this process.

130
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,600
I am gonna pull out my tortillas where we utilize that same corn today.

131
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,800
I have some blue corn.

132
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,600
Tortillas.

133
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,800
You could have any kind, you might have white, you might have yellow, you might have a red corn tortilla.

134
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,600
We're going to just pull those out.

135
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,200
Let them be a little life into them.

136
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,300
By take him out of that compostable Packaging.

137
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,200
I have some short rib video, short rib.

138
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,100
Now.

139
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,200
If you have a plant-based kit, this will be mushrooms.

140
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,600
Don't fret.

141
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,900
We're going to cook them the exact same way.

142
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,600
Okay, but we are going to use short, rib or mushroom.

143
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,900
I have cilantro.

144
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,600
I have some white onion and then some of our guests sealed that Oaxaca.

145
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:08,500
Okay, or oaxacan caps on beef, broth or mushroom broth.

146
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,200
Okay.

147
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,800
I have the rest of my life.

148
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,800
I am going to use a cutting board.

149
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:21,200
My knife last but not least my platter that I am going to use these.

150
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,300
Do these tacos are now?

151
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:22,700
Remember.

152
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,700
We're going to do eight.

153
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,900
Small tacos.

154
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,500
So, you want to play big enough for the tacos to fit around?

155
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:38,500
We also need another container for vessel for the consomme, which we will pour into this.

156
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,700
Once, we are finished building the tacos, right?

157
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:50,700
Large platter, couple, consummates about 6 ounces of consommé, if I start putting numbers out there and that means nothing to you.

158
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,400
That's fine.

159
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,700
That's going to hold about half a cup to a cup.

160
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,200
Okay?

161
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,400
Now I just want to walk over to the stovetop.

162
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,000
Tell you what we need here?

163
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,000
I am going to use a small sauce pot.

164
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,600
It's got about a 3 inside.

165
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,700
It's got about a 3-inch side here, and I am going to fill this is one thing.

166
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,100
I am going to use.

167
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:25,300
I am also going to use A saute pan here, or I am going to use a cast-iron.

168
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:37,700
I am going to use this to heat up our beef or arts or our excuse me, mushrooms, and then I have With me at the mall.

169
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,400
Now, you may not have one of these, that's fine.

170
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,600
We're going to do on that is we're going to heat up.

171
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,800
Our tacos.

172
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,700
Are for p as we're going to, like melt the cheese into the tortilla.

173
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So if you don't have a Kamal or a griddle top or something of that sort, just think about something that you might cook like eggs on or pancakes or bacon like a nonstick.

174
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,800
Something pretty large cause we're going to cook multiple Tacos on that.

175
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,600
At the same time.

176
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,900
I am going to cook, you know, two or four to time.

177
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,400
You could do.

178
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,200
Depending on the size of your pan, you can you all?

179
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,900
I ate it once, but you likely don't have a pan that big unless you have maybe a built-in flattop.

180
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,600
We will just do a couple of the time and it's going to be super fun and super easy.

181
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,400
All right.

182
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,600
So one more time, when I go through all of that, we have our chips and salsa.

183
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,100
We have our poor drink.

184
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,200
All right, we have all the ingredients in a bowl for being salad.

185
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,300
We have our platter Consul make up here.

186
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,800
We pulled out the ingredients for a tacos.

187
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:45,300
I have here one pan to heat up my Beef or mushroom one pot to heat up my broth.

188
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,600
And then I have my Surface in which I am going to continue to cook the tacos.

189
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,300
Now, if you don't have multiple pans, you can actually make one pan work.

190
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:01,200
It will take a couple extra steps of pulling the meat out, putting it into a container and then wiping that pan out, but that's totally fine.

191
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,900
If you want to kind of cut down on your dishes.

192
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,400
All right, so they're going to give everyone a few minutes to kind of In fact, going to a breakout room.

193
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,200
And from there, we're going to come back, and we're going to start cooking.

194
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,300
All right, so you will see a screen inviting you to your breakout room?

195
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,600
Just hit except and I will see you back here in about seven eight minutes.

196
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,700
All right, they all get out of here.

197
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,000
Do you have put me into the big homes?

198
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,300
Alrighty, welcome back.

199
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,100
I hope everyone was able to connect a little bit, the breakout rooms.

200
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,400
Enjoy your Margarita and have some of your to do post and your salsa.

201
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,700
Need a little bit of smokiness from that red salsa.

202
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,000
It's so delicious.

203
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,200
And you have tanginess from the Verde sauce.

204
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,300
It's in there as well.

205
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,700
Maybe forger, second drink.

206
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,300
I don't know.

207
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,500
Again, not here to clock your drinking, but if you have it.

208
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,300
Now might be a good time to do.

209
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,500
So, we're going to make this salad.

210
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,400
What I want to do with this salad, those I want to give it a little bit of a marination period?

211
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
So we're going to start the salad.

212
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,300
We're not going to finish it all the way yet.

213
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,200
We're going to let the beans marinate for a little bit as we heat up our tacos.

214
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,700
Okay.

215
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
So the first thing I want to do is I am going to take my mixing bowl.

216
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,100
I am going to take my beans and hominy and before the package right in the bowl.

217
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,800
Just like so, super simple.

218
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,300
Okay.

219
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,800
Next, I have some red onion here.

220
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:40,100
I am just going to slice thinly, right across the grain like this.

221
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,500
I like to use about.

222
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:52,900
Half of what you're probably had in your kit personally with this amount of being.

223
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,100
So, you see how I have very seen that ratio.

224
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,700
I am going to save this onion for some stock or something.

225
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:08,800
Alright, next, I am going to take our Tomatoes these Rebel Tomatoes.

226
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,900
It comes from Marfa, Texas, and I am just going to cut the bigger ones in like third recorders.

227
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,000
Maybe the smaller ones and just halves like.

228
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,500
So we have some nice, Red Onion.

229
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,300
Excuse me.

230
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,500
You do have the red onion.

231
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,900
You also have some nice, red, tomatoes, and yellow tomatoes.

232
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,400
Some are sweeter than the other.

233
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,800
The yellow tends to be more.

234
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,900
Heart, right.

235
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,300
I am just going to start to give that a toss.

236
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,400
Next, I am going to take so you should have most of your line left.

237
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,700
You take a bit of that.

238
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,700
Give this some lime juice.

239
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,100
This is going to help the marination process.

240
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,100
I am going to take some of my mulled own salt.

241
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,800
You may not have open that package up yet.

242
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,200
That is the other package of salt.

243
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,800
You have.

244
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,700
I am going to season my salad a bit.

245
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,400
Now.

246
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,900
There has been some seasoning added.

247
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,700
So we're just adding a touch more really to taste.

248
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,400
I just have a pinch and I season from hi.

249
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:13,600
All right, so it gets nice and Incorporated, and then we take about two-thirds of my Paseo oil.

250
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,300
I am going to put it right on there.

251
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:22,800
I am only going to use two-thirds of it or so because I am going to use the rest of it to garnish when that time comes.

252
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,400
I have a kitchen spoon, give this a nice stir.

253
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,900
So what's happening?

254
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,700
Is that Smoky plescia.

255
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,700
All right, which is the Smoky lockable pepper.

256
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,900
The Red, Onion, the black beans, and the harmony.

257
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,400
With those Tomatoes, the salt, the lime are going to marinate and really impart a bunch of flavor.

258
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,600
Just going to put that aside.

259
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:59,600
I do have my herbs and my queso fresco and rest assured if you have a base hit York as a fresco is also plant-based.

260
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:06,300
We're just going to save that for when we plate our salad.

261
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,800
Okay.

262
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,400
It's just going to marinate for a bit.

263
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:15,000
— I would put my bowl back on my side, put the spoon and its place.

264
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,800
And now we're going to start cooking.

265
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,100
All right, step 1.

266
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,300
Let us take our beef broth, or you may have a mushroom broth.

267
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,600
Let us pour that into our sauce pot.

268
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,900
We nice and thick.

269
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:36,300
There's some good viscous bone broth in there.

270
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,100
You have the short rib broth.

271
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,700
Well, I am going to turn my burner on.

272
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:47,000
I am going to put that at about a medium-high heat, and we're going to let that heat up till it gets to about a simmer.

273
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:48,900
Now.

274
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,100
I am going to take my cast-iron pan.

275
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,900
I am going to put that on a low heat.

276
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,200
I have already done so personally so you go ahead and do that.

277
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,800
Put on a low heat.

278
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,100
We're just going to use this to heat.

279
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,400
Up our, our beef have that on a low heat.

280
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:04,700
Now.

281
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:16,600
I have my coma which I sorry about earlier or my flat top cooking surface here, which I am going to heat my tortillas and sort of do the finishing of my tacos on now.

282
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,100
This works very well-to-do multiple tacos.

283
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,000
If you do not have something like this cool.

284
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,500
We will get through.

285
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,600
It will use something else.

286
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,700
I do encourage you to buy one though.

287
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,900
If you cook often, it's great for bacon pancakes.

288
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,400
All To do eggs on it like to fry potatoes on it.

289
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,300
They usually on the other side have like a griddle, like a grill marks, you can grill fish on it.

290
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:43,000
So I am going to sort anyway, if you don't have any like this, a large pan, that you would cook Crepes or pancakes anything like that.

291
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And we will work like a big non-stick pan works really?

292
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,300
Well.

293
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,500
This is cast iron.

294
00:41:47,500 --> 00:42:00,000
It's nice and seasoned, but I am going to like take a little bit of my neutral oil and just give it another little seasoning oil so that when that time comes, I was ready to go.

295
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,200
So this is already on a low, to medium Heat.

296
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,800
I am just letting that heat up and get ready.

297
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:17,100
When the time comes we're going to turn the heat up a little bit more to a low medium to like a medium to medium-high, but for now, it's just heating slowly.

298
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,600
This pan is heating slowly.

299
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,200
My stock on my Quantum, an is heating slowly.

300
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:28,700
I am gonna check the chat and make sure that I am not missing any questions if we can go over to the chat.

301
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:33,900
Most Wanted.

302
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:39,800
Awesome.

303
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,000
I see a big dog.

304
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,100
Well as a cute dog.

305
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,500
All right.

306
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,100
It doesn't look like we have any real questions about the food.

307
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,700
So that's great.

308
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,400
But I do love that.

309
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,800
You're sharing your hearing your photos, showing your dog picks.

310
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,800
There's your canine sous-chef if you will.

311
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,900
Okay, so we have that on going up there.

312
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,000
Any questions, please, ask them now.

313
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,900
Next.

314
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:09,600
I am going to open up my short rib video.

315
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,400
And what I am doing is I am giving this three nice cuss like this, and I have kind of opened it.

316
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,100
Just opens up like a book.

317
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,600
So I am going to use this packaging to help you.

318
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,700
If you have the mushroom.

319
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,200
You cannot really do that with the mushroom.

320
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,800
Just give it one cut, but if you do have a short rib, this is a great way to do that.

321
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,800
Kind of put it aside.

322
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,000
We're not going to use it quite yet.

323
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:51,400
I have my guess, you know, that Oaxaca oaxacan to co which is made by hand from a family Oaxaca that makes us this cheese, and we get it at all of our restaurants a couple times a week.

324
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,700
It is amazing.

325
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,600
It is delicious.

326
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,000
Look how much that breaks up.

327
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,800
I would give it a little bite just to taste it.

328
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,400
It's creamy.

329
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:11,100
It's tart or Tonight, it's a rich and cheesy and also like that perfect amount of like funky cheese taster.

330
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,200
I am going to put that there and I will give up that are a little bit.

331
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,900
I am going to open up my white onion.

332
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:21,900
All right.

333
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,300
This is going to be to garnish our Taco.

334
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:33,500
So, often a street Taco, this video Taco sometimes like it's Aqua past or like a good carne asada.

335
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:49,600
You will see like a typical accompaniment or Darkness to that will be cilantro or, and lime wedges and diced up onion, white onion.

336
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,200
And so, we're going to prepare that typical.

337
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,100
Mint right now, so I have the cilantro.

338
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,200
It's already picked for you.

339
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,800
So we're not really have to do anything with that.

340
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,200
Besides things on the package.

341
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,800
We have the line we're going to make lime wedges shortly.

342
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:15,000
And then I am just going to give this a nice Dice and I like to do a small dice because I don't want to bite into too much onion.

343
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:15,900
Okay?

344
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,600
And again, I am going to use about half of what I have here and save the rest of this onion for a nice stock layer.

345
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,300
And that's what I am going to use.

346
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,200
Now, depending on what your tastes are, what your flavor profiles.

347
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,700
You love is.

348
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,500
You may want to be more.

349
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:39,900
You may want to do less, totally cool, Choose Your Own Adventure and that one, go ahead and open up my cilantro.

350
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:47,700
All right, and let us keep this lime and give ourselves some wedges.

351
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,500
Well, I just do a little wedge, maybe one wedge for every couple tacos or Doom, really small.

352
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,700
I am going to put that aside.

353
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,700
So basically this is going to be our garnish and that time comes.

354
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,100
All right.

355
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:06,200
Bye.

356
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,000
Now, pot is hot.

357
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:20,600
Looks like my consomme or my beef stock, or maybe a mushroom stock is heating up nicely that congealed Ridge.

358
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,800
Bone marrow in there as it's often doubt.

359
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,700
Give it a little taste of this.

360
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,500
Very delicious.

361
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,400
It's nice and hot which is how we want it.

362
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:41,600
So we're going to put that down to a low heat and then I have my Kamal heating up Now's the Time when I am probably going to put that on a medium heat because we're going to cook on that.

363
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,200
All right, I am gonna take about 5 Seconds, 10 seconds.

364
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,200
Check the chat.

365
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,900
Make sure there are no questions.

366
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:59,600
Make sure that everyone has confirmed that everyone has hot heating cooking vessels on their stove because once we get going, we got to go pretty fast.

367
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,500
I don't want anyone to fall behind.

368
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,000
All right.

369
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:05,900
Cool.

370
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,500
Good evening.

371
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,400
I am glad Pieces.

372
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,000
Good.

373
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,800
Yes, the cheese is so goofs.

374
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,000
Pete agrees.

375
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:18,500
We can good.

376
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,400
All right, looks like we're ready.

377
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,200
So, enjoy and chips and salsa.

378
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,600
Yeah, you can have you seen that mean?

379
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,900
It's like, what do I do?

380
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,200
Do I just keep beating them or do I die, right?

381
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,800
That's how I feel like substance also to cool down my plate.

382
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,400
We're ready.

383
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,200
I feel good.

384
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:34,900
You feel good.

385
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,100
Yes, yes.

386
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:47,300
Alright if you have just the regular traditional kit with the beauty of short rib tacos, we're going to do a little bit of oil in the pan.

387
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,900
If you have the mushroom kit, you will want a bit more oil because it is more liquidy.

388
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,900
Whereas the beef is more fatty.

389
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,600
I am going to open up the flip that down like that.

390
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,800
Remember, this is all compostable packaging that goes into my compost.

391
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,500
Now, this short rib and as well as the mushrooms fully cooked.

392
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,800
So we're really kind of just heating this up.

393
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,800
We're not really, we're not, we're not looking to get a sear.

394
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,900
Let me a little bit of a Sears, always great because it imparts some texture and flavor.

395
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,100
But this is cooked.

396
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:30,200
We want this heated up enough, to be able to break it up into are eight different top of.

397
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,900
Remember, this is enough for a taco.

398
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:37,200
So keep that in mind as you're building the tacos, now, there may be some pieces of the body.

399
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:37,900
Short rib.

400
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:43,400
That is, you know, that fattiness really just needs to be broken up with a spoon or spatula.

401
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,100
Go ahead and do that.

402
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,600
Now, a pair of tongs will work.

403
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:56,400
Right, let us just break that all up now, so that we go to build the tacos, ready to go.

404
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:58,700
Okay.

405
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,600
Now I am going to turn my heat off because I am hot, that's all it took.

406
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,400
If you see here, Mike, Lonesome a, let us come to a full boil.

407
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,800
I do not want it that hot because inevitably, I am gonna stick my fingers in it, and I am gonna burn myself.

408
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,700
So let us turn it down.

409
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,800
Hot me or if you have mushrooms?

410
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,300
It should look about the same hot stock.

411
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,300
I have my hot Kamal from now.

412
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,600
I have my tortillas right here.

413
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,700
I brought the cheese over.

414
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,700
And we're going to start building tacos, you already.

415
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:47,900
Okay, as you do have we seen the video Taco on the internet, the Instagram sensation or tick-tock?

416
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,600
Yes, doc.

417
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,300
We have seen it.

418
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,200
Oh, I see what you're saying about talking to me.

419
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:55,700
That's fine.

420
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,700
Yes, but he had tacos.

421
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,200
I will give you a little background.

422
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:08,000
We go in the big breakout rooms of where but it came from traditionally, but now this internet sensation is like this.

423
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Ew, e, gooey Taco.

424
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,200
You dip it in the sauce.

425
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,200
You needed some food trucks all over Austin.

426
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:17,200
I don't have my blessing country because you haven't been traveled as much as normal, right?

427
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,100
But they're delicious.

428
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,500
They're made with here.

429
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,300
They're going to maybe be made with these delicious scones with you.

430
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,200
Is that we grind.

431
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,600
Yeah, super, super stoked, okay.

432
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
I am going to take one tortilla.

433
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,600
Just going to let me I would be counterintuitive to some of y'all.

434
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,300
I am a dip it into my consomme.

435
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:48,300
This is one of the reasons that it's important to have a seasoning or a fat on your cooking surface because when we put this 40 on the cooking surface, we don't want it to stick.

436
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,100
See what it's doing right there.

437
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,900
That's great.

438
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,400
That's perfect.

439
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,300
That's what we want.

440
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,600
I am going to do for tacos to start.

441
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:06,100
Again, we have give me enough for eight depending on how hungry you are, or who you have there with you, you can decide how many to cook.

442
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,400
Want to make sure?

443
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,400
Free and then let us go with the fourth one.

444
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,500
Okay.

445
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:24,500
Now I am going to go back to my first one because it is now ready for slip.

446
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,200
We hope that we have enough fat so that it doesn't stick you see.

447
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,000
I have a little sticky notes here, but that's okay.

448
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,400
I am gonna use.

449
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,200
Well today.

450
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,800
I am going to use the spoon but if you have a spatula you can use that too.

451
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,400
Get up off.

452
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,900
Give it a nice flip.

453
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,200
I am going to find a spatula real quick.

454
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,800
You should as well.

455
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,400
And you give the second one, the flip.

456
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,700
Again.

457
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,900
This is why it's important to have a decent amount of fat on your pan.

458
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:04,800
But if you have a little bit of a rip like I do, I am going to show you an incredible way to incredibly delicious way to fix it.

459
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,500
Even some of you may already know what I am going to do a tour to fix it.

460
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,100
All right, and I am going to give this next flip on the last one.

461
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,800
Like so cool.

462
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,600
These look great.

463
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,800
I am totally cool with this little bit of a rip here.

464
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,600
I am just going to throw some cheese over it.

465
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,300
Remember, this is enough cheese for ate tacos.

466
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:34,500
I know you're going to want to put so much of this delicious cheese on there.

467
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,500
But a little goes a really long way.

468
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,900
And if you have the Basically, you do have a plant-based cheese.

469
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,500
Alright, so we have now our meat.

470
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:53,100
Okay, when you put that right over the cheese again, this is enough for eight.

471
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,500
So each one is just a little bit of really rich meat and really rich cheese, okay.

472
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,400
I have another four tacos ready to go.

473
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,600
I have my mean I have my cheese on my garnish.

474
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,500
Ready, will take this spatula.

475
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:23,400
I am going to go ahead and fold my first Taco like, so again for my full my second Taco, like, so and you see right where I have that.

476
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:23,800
Rip.

477
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,900
No Freddie.

478
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,200
No worries.

479
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,000
I tacos are coming together.

480
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,000
This is not one of those like super.

481
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,200
This is, I mean, it is beautiful.

482
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,400
It's delicious.

483
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,000
It's not one of those super like high-touch fancy meal things right?

484
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,200
We're just making some delicious food.

485
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:48,400
Here are making sure that cheese is not kind of binding that taco down, and then we take some more of that consomme.

486
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,800
I am just going to put it over my tacos.

487
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,800
I want to keep that taco.

488
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,000
Nice and gooey.

489
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,300
Right.

490
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,000
Look at that.

491
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,500
And you see the heat is just making that evaporate.

492
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,900
You got the cheese coming off the side.

493
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,900
That's exactly what we're looking for.

494
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,100
Let that cook for another minute.

495
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,500
Even split.

496
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,700
Give a flip.

497
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,200
Another flip.

498
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,500
You got crispy cheese.

499
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:24,900
There we go.

500
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,200
I am going to start with my next tortilla.

501
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,400
So I can do four more.

502
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,700
Put these tacos up to the side of us.

503
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,200
Lower heat side of my Kamal.

504
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,800
Make sure have some more fat down there because I didn't have enough to begin with.

505
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:51,300
If you remember, that's fine, less and learn can always fix that.

506
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,400
Take my soaps for Kia.

507
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,800
Remember this consomme we're going to end up using it as our dip.

508
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,400
All right.

509
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,600
All right, we're going to pull that first few tacos off.

510
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:19,500
They're going to stay nice and hot and start putting them on my plate.

511
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,100
Like so.

512
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,000
The first one here.

513
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,000
I told you this part.

514
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,900
We're going to start moving a little bit fast.

515
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,000
But again, we're just making tacos.

516
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,800
This is fun.

517
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:46,200
This is not rocket science or super fancy food.

518
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,000
This is delicious and miliar.

519
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,100
Homey style Homestyle food.

520
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:57,400
All right.

521
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,900
Where to go Keys down on that?

522
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,000
First one, I flipped.

523
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,900
Put into that meat in there.

524
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,300
Go to the next split.

525
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,900
So let us get a little bit of color on it.

526
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,400
Like a little caramelization.

527
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,500
That's great.

528
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,400
We want that.

529
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,000
Please rest a cheese for the last few tacos.

530
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,700
Make sure evenly.

531
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,400
Throw s***.

532
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:45,000
A couple tacos in the meat.

533
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,400
Or mushrooms.

534
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,900
Now, I will get let you in on a little secret.

535
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,700
I actually this means great.

536
00:56:54,700 --> 00:57:06,800
This is from a local Rancher here in Texas, high quality delicious free-range beef and I just, I love eating it.

537
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,000
I have no, you know, have no aversions to meat or beef.

538
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,700
But this kit, I actually prefer the mushrooms are so good.

539
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:18,400
So if you ever offered an opportunity to eat, Mushrooms in this way.

540
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,800
I highly recommend it.

541
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,600
I give a little fold here.

542
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,700
The fold on my next taco.

543
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:32,100
And then my last fold, I am going to let that cook for a minute.

544
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:40,700
It unfolds, go ahead and come back and just kind of force it uses that cheese to help find it.

545
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,800
Okay, see that perfect.

546
00:57:51,700 --> 00:58:03,500
I give it one more spoonful of consomme like so, Make sure that these are nice and gooey.

547
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:10,200
It's almost like, you know, into ladas aren't super common in Mexico.

548
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,900
And the way that you see them in the u.s.

549
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,700
You're more actually more like this.

550
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,300
We just have a fold over a little bit of sauce and some filling.

551
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,900
Okay, cool.

552
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,400
All those last few cooks.

553
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,700
Let us go ahead and finish our bean salad because this will just take a minute.

554
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:33,000
We have that marinated Bean that's going to go straight into the bowl.

555
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:45,900
We have some of our honey do queso fresco, which is a local cheese will go to Austin.

556
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,500
We have our fresh herbs here.

557
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,300
Let us hear some of them up there.

558
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,000
Different herbs in here and there might be some frilly mustard.

559
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,000
You might have some amaranths wood.

560
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,200
Sorrel, even all these are grown just for us at our farm.

561
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,000
Okay.

562
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:13,100
What Charleston, dianthus Leaf Samara gold leaf, and then we just want that to look really beautiful to take a little bit more of that Paseo oil.

563
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:16,000
We had just finish it.

564
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:25,000
This number, that's a fully compostable bag.

565
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,300
And that is finished, and we go back to wear the clothes.

566
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,100
They did great and turn all the heat off on my stove.

567
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:37,400
Now.

568
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,600
I am going to finish building out my taco platter here.

569
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:43,400
Look at that.

570
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,600
Nice crispy side Bowie.

571
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:57,900
Let us just Yes, I am right.

572
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:03,800
And she's here, and I am going to take you as my consomme looking for it, right in?

573
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:12,100
Think of if you want to compare to something think of like an Azu sandwich, right?

574
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,200
Where you take your sandwich and take a bite and dip it in your broth.

575
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,500
Take these onions.

576
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,900
So she long throw?

577
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,600
How to fold the tacos?

578
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,800
Now, you can't really you're right.

579
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,100
Danielle mess up a taco too poorly.

580
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,300
How to fold the taco.

581
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,600
I just, you know, I use the tongs it's bad.

582
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:48,400
So I am sure we're past that point now, but I just saw that in the top here.

583
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,700
I have some lime wedges.

584
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,800
Take the rest of this onion.

585
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,500
All right, we have it.

586
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,200
Like so.

587
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:12,400
Even a little bit into the consummate is how I prefer that, because some of that onion flavor, starts to come out, oil starts to come out like that.

588
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,500
And there we have it.

589
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,100
The Vessel Margarita, we have already eaten our chips and salsa.

590
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,600
You probably you may have drank and had a drink of all your Margarita by now, too.

591
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,600
How does that look for y'all?

592
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:31,100
I know.

593
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:33,700
Are you enjoying it?

594
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:34,200
Are we?

595
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:35,900
All right.

596
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,800
I would love to have a first bite with you.

597
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:43,500
But I want to make sure that everyone catches up who everyone who's cooking tonight.

598
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,400
And if you're not cooking tonight, and you do have your kit rest assured.

599
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,300
There are instructions in the kit are super clear.

600
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,700
You have a little bit of some structural video on our part.

601
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,800
And so now you have a good idea of how it's supposed to go.

602
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,300
And yeah, you can just follow those instructions, but I am gonna go ahead and have this first bite.

603
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,200
So I like to use like to grab the taco.

604
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:10,000
Okay, I have some lime, make sure I have some of that cilantro on there, some of those onions.

605
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,900
And I am going to dip it into that consomme.

606
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:13,700
Get that.

607
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,900
This is a little messy.

608
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,500
That's okay.

609
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,500
This is how we do it.

610
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:28,700
That's so delicious.

611
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:30,700
What do y'all think?

612
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,100
Is he one having a bite yet?

613
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,900
Yes, you can drag and drop a picture into the text.

614
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,800
I am gonna go have a bite of my bean salad.

615
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,300
Now sometimes a bean salad may seem kind of boring, but I show you.

616
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,000
This means I was really delicious.

617
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,500
I encourage you to have a bite now.

618
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,200
What do y'all think?

619
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:19,600
Danielle.

620
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,800
Did you do delete all your tacos?

621
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,600
I sure hope not.

622
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,000
I hope they left some for you.

623
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:32,900
Awesome.

624
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:45,000
So I assume there're any questions because everyone's still cooking when I hope that everyone's having a great experience with the cooking or you're eating and enjoying it so much.

625
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:50,300
What I would like to do is know if there's no more.

626
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,800
No more instructional questions.

627
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,400
Let us go into these breakout rooms to have a taco party.

628
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,000
And I would love to come in and out of those rooms and check in.

629
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:05,900
And you all, maybe tell you a little bit of story of how this came about, maybe share a chocolate with you, because, you know, I am ready for dinner as well.

630
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,400
All right, now to go into the breakout rooms, you're going to have a little prompt.

631
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,700
On your screen will say join.

632
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,000
Join the taco party.

633
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,000
Go ahead and click on that and join that taco party.

634
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,900
Yeah, I think that's how they want to do.

635
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:36,800
She knows.

636
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:46,500
Booster, you know, stuck out.

637
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,100
She knows that guy.

638
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:57,400
Does he ever belong here?

639
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,900
Baby, I omentum and no doubt.

640
01:07:44,900 --> 01:08:02,500
Cuando me outside your so don't chose a Bulgari.

641
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,000
Not by your the what I do anymore.

642
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:30,600
Is he do my dear to permit, the September of daughter?

643
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,600
I am using gonna look into a mirror.

644
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:31,700
I am 42 years old, but that is impressive.

645
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:34,300
She knows what's coming.

646
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,000
You know, Stackhouse.

647
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:51,900
She knows that guy that she ever belong here.

648
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:44,700
McConnell owner of bouldin food Forest, sustainable Farm in Rogers, Texas, we grow primarily Greens on here, 2016 started, Urban farming in South Austin, and I wanted to have more land because gardening was a hobby that got out of control.

649
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,200
So we practice permaculture principles out here.

650
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:56,000
The way you can Define permaculture is that get is a way to design an ecosystem that is beneficial to plan.

651
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,400
Since oil.

652
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:03,100
And humans, one of our primary missions is to lead the land in better shape than when we found it.

653
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,000
A lot of farmers.

654
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,800
Don't practice that we have these tunnels.

655
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,100
We have hundred-foot tunnels.

656
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:11,600
We have five of them on our farm right now, and they are great.

657
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:16,200
Protectors from extreme weather star Greenhouse.

658
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:25,100
And then we transplant by hand, all of these letters, heads that we have grown in our Greenhouse from seed.

659
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,500
So, everything we grow here, we have grown ourselves.

660
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,200
I love, love, love growing lettuce.

661
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:42,900
Well, you'd be enjoying at your event or lettuce is from this bed and most likely this bed for the folks who are going to be part of this event.

662
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,100
I think you're going to really like this lettuce.

663
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:53,300
One of the things that I really love about Austin is how food-centric it is.

664
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:57,900
So many great restaurants in Austin by local farms.

665
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,900
There's a really nice healthy diversity of farms.

666
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:09,800
And that wouldn't exist if restaurants and school districts, grocery stores, weren't supporting those local farms.

667
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:16,200
The more you keep your money local, the more you're growing, the economy in the You're growing the future health of your own community.

668
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:19,500
And that's its great to see often.

669
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,200
Not only talk that talk.

670
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:21,800
That really walk.

671
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,400
That walk.

672
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:29,500
Awesome.

673
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:34,300
Well, I hope that you have all had a great experience.

674
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:39,100
I know some of you may come from the breakout rooms, and he may be cooking still in front of making into your room.

675
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:39,700
I am sorry.

676
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:41,800
I am here.

677
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,400
Now for any quick questions.

678
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,800
You may have or anything that goes into the chat.

679
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,700
I would be happy to answer.

680
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:53,000
And if we rather just enjoy your food, put your, put your kids to bed.

681
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,400
Totally great.

682
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,300
But I hope you were able to pay attention that last video.

683
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:03,900
One thing that makes what we do, I think so special is that we are fully committed to using.

684
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:13,400
You know, obviously I said over and over again Nico packet and go friendly packaging and you have some literature in your box about what that Eco packet, eco-friendly Packaging.

685
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:23,100
Entails, but we also Source locally everything we Source other than the things that we get from Mexico, which one we get two things from actually make sure that we're all so.

686
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:28,700
Thoughtfully sourcing getting organic making sure that our dollars are going back into communities.

687
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:33,300
That better those communities and it's very, very important to us.

688
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:56,000
But also when we do Source locally, which is probably the other 70% of what we have, it's always, you know, thoughtfully grown in a thirty to sixty mile, radius of the front door of assembly from the beef to if you have any of our kids that have seafood, we get everything from the Gulf from day boat, Fisher's, as well as all the produce is grown locally.

689
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,200
Obviously, if you have a kid that has pineapple in it, we do that.

690
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:07,200
Sometimes we don't get the pineapples locally, but for the most part like again, it's always thoughtful practicing?

691
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:11,900
Or make sure way we are getting those products is somewhere that we know.

692
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,600
We're not only in the best product of Using the best practices.

693
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:18,700
Awesome.

694
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:19,800
Yes.

695
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,700
Thank you, Amy.

696
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,000

So let us see here.

All right, have any of you been on a safari?

25
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,100
This is in real life or virtual.

26
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,600
Wow.

27
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

I haven't either.

29
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,400
I haven't done a virtual Safari yet.

30
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,000
So this is going to be a fun experience.

31
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,900

It's going to be great.

35
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,400
All right.

36
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:53,300
So with that, I would love to introduce our partners on the panel today, Suman from Marco experiences and Aaron from Bonus, Lee.

37
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,400
Would you join me on stage?

38
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,000
Hallo.

39
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,900
Hey everyone.

40
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,900
Hello.

41
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,500
Hello.

42
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,100
Well II am so blessed to have you graced our stage, both of you.

43
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:17,300
It's wonderful to be with you all before we jump into talking about some really cool team building ideas because I know each of you have golden insights to share with us.

44
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,600
Let us go in with some fun facts.

45
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,300
So fun facts, right?

46
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,800
All right, so fun facts.

47
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,400
Just about me is that, when I was early in my twenties way, back in the day.

48
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,400
I was on Ugly.

49
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:30,800
Betty.

50
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,300
Believe it or not and 7th Heaven and see.

51
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,200
Yes, I did.

52
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Adam Sandler movies back in the day.

53
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,700
So yeah, that's my fun fact.

54
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,400
I am going to hand it over to you Suman.

55
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,900
What's your fun?

56
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,100
Fact fun fact is I have a twin brother.

57
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,000
His name is Vig.

58
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,400
He's on the west coast, the better-looking twin as you can see in this photo here with this beautiful dog that I am embracing.

59
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,300
So as my fun fact, very cool.

60
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,400
Aaron.

61
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,700
Your fun fact.

62
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:05,200
A fun fact is one of my tweets made it into an Atlantic article ton of high C codes had been learning French.

63
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,200
Each and he asked if anyone could explain the subjunctive tense, very cool.

64
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,300
And I am super curious about how to cook objective.

65
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,300
That's good.

66
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, both of you have some really interesting insights around creative team, building ideas, and just things that you have been implementing with your companies and with your own teams.

67
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:43,600
And so before we jump into that though, can each of you just tell us a little bit about like Marco and even bonus lie, What are you guys seeing as, like, really interesting trends of your customers and I will start off Aaron with you?

68
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:44,900
Yes.

69
00:07:44,900 --> 00:08:02,400
Well, I think bonus lead is the perfect app for, you know, the times that we have in remote work and everything like that because it really encourages engagement and recognition and it really brings employees together and you don't necessarily have to be in the same room.

70
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, I will hop in so Marco.

71
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,600
I guess the trend is where our company is literally focused all around connectivity in a more distributed kind of flexible world.

72
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,500
So Marco, I am the CEO and co-founder of Marco.

73
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:33,299
We cultivate culture and connection through extraordinary experiences virtual and person off sites, but really excited to be sharing kind of one of our virtual host today with you and talking all about how we think about Marco and how we build our own distributed team, which is kind of all over the world.

74
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,600
So Very cool.

75
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,299
Thank you for sharing.

76
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,400
So, Aaron just go on, talking about your own team right now?

77
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,000
You are a people leader of an engineering team.

78
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,800
And over this pandemic.

79
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,100
You have identified some really cool ways to keep your team connected and interacting.

80
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,700
What are some of those things?

81
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,200
Well, whenever I started as an engineering manager, we were all pretty new to each other.

82
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:09,500
So, the first thing I did was created an about me page is basically a page online that, you know, I feel about questions.

83
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:16,400
Like, where did I grow up how to support me at work or, you know, how I prefer to get positive and negative feedback.

84
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,000
And, so I filled that page out but I also asked my team to fill those out, too.

85
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
So it's been very helpful.

86
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,400
Very cool.

87
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,200
What platform or how do you guys?

88
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:34,600
Fed up, you just put up a WordPress page or, you know, we actually use Confluence as a tool for documentation.

89
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,500
And in our space, we put it in.

90
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,900
Very nice.

91
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,900
Okay, and what are some other tactics?

92
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,600
I mean you were mentioning a few of them?

93
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:57,100
Well, I think the first thing I did that really helped the most was done a Clifton strengths finder survey of strengths finder, by the way, it's great.

94
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,100
We all talked about what we were good at and, you know, that actually informed our about me pages to.

95
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,500
And we talked about what the team was good at collectively and You know, we have a cross-functional team.

96
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,700
So our team includes members of design and product.

97
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,000
So, you know, generally the engineers were very analytical.

98
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,300
They have very analytical strengths in our design and product Partners had great relational strength.

99
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,200
So that kind of balance the team out.

100
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,800
That's great.

101
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,500
I could speak to the strings fine.

102
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,900
I have been using with various teams for last 10 years and it is awesome.

103
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,500
It's a really fun team building opportunity to when you bring in a coach.

104
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,200
I have done it virtually with our team as well.

105
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:52,100
And we hired a coach to come in, and we had everyone take their strengths finder prior to the coach coming in and I created an Excel doc that just Maps out the top-10 strengths of each of the team members.

106
00:10:52,300 --> 00:11:06,600
And then we started to analyze Eyes as a team and have a really healthy discussion of our strengths and you know where we default to in times of great stress or Joy or flow, you know what I am saying?

107
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,900
So it really helped us a ton Suman.

108
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,800
How about you all your Marcos?

109
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,700
Also, remote team.

110
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:19,400
I mean, of course you guys are the pro experiences, but how are you keeping your own teams engaged?

111
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,700
Yeah, I mean so our team is in New York, San Francisco.

112
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,700
AOL a Seattle, Miami Atlanta in the Philippines, and we're subbed 20 people.

113
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,600
So we're quite distributed.

114
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,200
I think one, there's a couple of themes that I would touch on one, is just proactivity.

115
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,100
So we create for ourselves as well as for our customers, what we call, like a culture calendar.

116
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,300
So instead of just being reactive and saying, oh my gosh, we haven't seen each other in a while.

117
00:11:43,400 --> 00:12:08,300
How do we actually create a way for folks to look forward to meeting whether it's kind of virtually more frequently in person less frequently, and we talked a lot about intentionality of So one of the interesting things that both of y'all touched on which is experiences can be fun, which is we're going to have fun today on this virtual Safari, but they can also be meaningful and really provide an opportunity to get to know one another and allow us to kind of do our best work.

118
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:14,800
So, even today instead of a normal team meeting, we're doing something called the super story, which is a friend Sarah runs.

119
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:22,700
It's kind of similar to the strengthsfinder exercise, but it's really about who you are your life thread and kind of your new your unique powers, your super story.

120
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,200
And so Experience is its a new experience since it will be on our platform soon.

121
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,800
But those are opportunities where you can really understand, like, who is Aaron, for example, get to know her.

122
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
Why is she?

123
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,600
What is she motivated by?

124
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:43,100
And I think if you think about why we do experiences, it's really, so we can provide that context and I think it allows us to do our best work.

125
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,500
So that's how we kind of approach it in our team.

126
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,300
So I love that.

127
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,300
And so far just the common theme of what I am hearing, just the for the initial team building.

128
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,500
Idea, you know, is really their exercises that help one.

129
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,000
Another get to know each other at another level.

130
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,400
I mean we can have amazing safaris happy hours and all these things.

131
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:14,700
But at the end of the day if we're not feeling that connection and deeper understanding of one, another than those things aren't as meaningful.

132
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:23,700
So can each of you speak to that a little bit of just like how you have been able to create some of those deeper connections.

133
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:31,400
And, you know, I think we're missing out with the in-person water cooler like bum pins and, you know, all the way to the kitchen.

134
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,100
Hey, want to grab some coffee?

135
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,900
Like we missed that these days.

136
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,300
So, how are each of you accomplishing that within your team's today?

137
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,300
Yeah, I can, I can jump it.

138
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:49,500
I think one important thing is, we're living in a world that's been pretty crazy for the past two years.

139
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,600
And even now there's another outbreak of covid or a geopolitical kind of Crisis.

140
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,000
And one thing is just acknowledging the stress that people are going through.

141
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,700
And there's this concept of bringing your whole self to work and just allowing for a space where you can talk about mental health.

142
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:14,400
You can talk about how you're stressed out whether that's kind of your personal life or your work life, and I think creating the Safe spaces, and you can do that through experiences.

143
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,000
You can just do that through a check in and whether it's, you know, through report and saying, hey look like how are you doing?

144
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,500
Maybe we take a moment to breathe together, that sort of thing.

145
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I think is really impactful and allows folks to open up when they might not be able to you know on board and meet everyone.

146
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,000
Now, they can provide a safe space to kind of get to know one another in a real way.

147
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,700
I think so good.

148
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,500
I completely agree with that.

149
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
How about you Aaron?

150
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,800
Well, I think I, once I read a study that mentions that parallel communication or side-by-side communication Foster's cooperation.

151
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,900
And it also Fosters's more intimacy than when you sit across from each other.

152
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,400
So it's kind of like a sports team.

153
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,600
You face your opponent and your next to your teammate.

154
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:03,400
And what we, what I do a lot is play video games actually, so we have to coordinate.

155
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
We're kind of team.

156
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:19,800
There's a lot of (Mario) Kart a lot of jackbox games, but Yeah, I think that kind of breaks down the barrier of defensiveness or self-consciousness, and then, you know, it creates a little bit more of a Teen Spirit.

157
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,400
I love that and we're seeing some folks.

158
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,300
Drop some insight Samantha.

159
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:32,600
I completely agree that it's on the leaders and managers to set the tone MJ looks like you agree with that too.

160
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:41,800
And I think that's, that's really important as people leaders and managers that, you know, were able to maintain Suman.

161
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:49,300
Some of what you're talking about that empathy during times such as this were, there's uncertainty, and some volatility.

162
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:56,200
Even how do we Continue to keep that balance of vulnerability to those things?

163
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:03,700
Yet also strength and resilience, you know, it's such a fine line of a balance, but I believe it can be done.

164
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:14,600
Yeah, I think going on what Aaron said, providing kind of talking about, a lot of Studies have been published recently McKinsey published a study in September about kind of the great resignation.

165
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,600
One of the things they found was one of the biggest reasons why people are leaving their jobs is because they don't have a sense of belonging.

166
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,100
Longing.

167
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:27,600
And, so I think investing in creating that sense of belonging is actually super, super important.

168
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,100
It actually provides business results.

169
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:45,400
So I think people sometimes think about events and experiences which we're doing now and it's kind of it can be a Band-Aid and just kind of something that you need to do, but I think approaching it with a different mindset with intentionality and saying, oh, how do I actually Foster a connection belonging and also still maintaining kind of strong business results in strength.

170
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,500
And that balance that you mentioned Gina is super effective important.

171
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,200
Yes, love that.

172
00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:00,100
And as far as the strengthsfinder, it's a great tool to help you get to know the team members.

173
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,300
Now.

174
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,200
It's only a tool.

175
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,400
All these things were talking about experiences, even strengths finder.

176
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:14,800
If you don't use those insights to actually get to know your team, spend the time, get in the trenches with them, ask the hard questions and really engage with them.

177
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,000
Then none of these tools and experiences mean anything.

178
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:27,700
So I think to your point see you in about Belonging like how that's ultimately like I think of Maslow's hierarchy of needs that's like the Pinnacle right?

179
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,500
Of having everyone feel that outcome.

180
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:41,300
But there's some basic layers of things that we can provide our team members to get to that sense of belonging on a daily basis.

181
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,600
Totally thoughts to that.

182
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,700
Yeah.

183
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,700
I mean, I think the, there's actually two me.

184
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,500
I feel people are really stressed, and it's been kind of challenging couple of years.

185
00:17:52,500 --> 00:18:01,300
I will be the first to acknowledge, that's been the case for me, but I think the opportunity we have now is to rethink our relationship with life and work.

186
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:07,600
And so there's this opportunity to actually reset and hopefully we can emerge from this time and say, well, what do I actually?

187
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,000
I mean, I spend a lot of time at work, how do I, you know, get the most out of it?

188
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:21,400
And how do we Structure kind of you know, the Cadence and frequency and kind of how we all kind of show up and connect them with one another to where it's actually positive.

189
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:31,900
And, so I am actually super excited about kind of the future in the next few years and the like, we now have a lot of flexibility, but how do we maintain that flexibility?

190
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
But still retain this connectivity.

191
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,800
We can do that virtually.

192
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,000
We, that person we can do that.

193
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,400
A bunch of different ways, but that's, I think the natural tension the challenge, but also kind of the opportunity that we have.

194
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,100
Love that.

195
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,000
And just a tack on to the idea of belonging.

196
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,400
There's actually a framework called biceps and belonging is the be and biceps.

197
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:59,300
So it's sort of being includes like equality or Equity, predictability, significance and things like that.

198
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:09,800
So I think that, you know, factoring all of those factors into sort of building a team or creating a culture on the team can really help.

199
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
That is nice.

200
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,700
So biceps like that.

201
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,000
Could you drop that in chat for us so that we can see what you have is the acronyms?

202
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,500
That's pretty powerful there.

203
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So we got it some of the deep stuff and that's really the meaningful thing is everything we're talking about right now.

204
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:49,400
It's that over communication connecting its vulnerability, you know, really it engages with our team members in times like this and then There's that layer above it of will, there's a fun experiences and video games to amazing virtual safaris.

205
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,600
I mean, with welcome.

206
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,400
We're actually playing with this idea of creating our environment as a cafe.

207
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:12,500
And so we have been doing a cafe on a weekly basis where we invite all of our team members to just hang out, and we have got some nice Lounge music, and we have created the environment to feel very like, bring your coffee cup and on us, you know, kind of moment.

208
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,000
So let us talk a little bit about those creative ideas and experiences.

209
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,500
I know Aaron, you mentioned some Suman.

210
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:26,200
What are you guys doing these days and why are companies pull in from you all?

211
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,900
Well, the cool thing is a bit of a backstory.

212
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,300
I have had traditional careers until this point and now we get to have a lot of fun, right?

213
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:45,400
So I worked in finance prior to Marco and now we're finding new hosts and empowering them to, you know, bring their creative passions to new customers such as the folks here.

214
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,000
And so, just a few.

215
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,300
I mean, by the way, I am all for kind of having fun.

216
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,500
We just had a meeting with our team and everyone put on a different ridiculous hat just for no reason.

217
00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:01,900
And that kind of stuff is like silly, but people, you know, got some smiles and you can just bring a little bit of levity to what is normally kind of perhaps a stressful meeting.

218
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:14,700
But, I mean, just a few in addition to the one that you will see, so I won't cover that one, but there's a brand called Marco ice cream and I found Marco ice cream through a Friend, and they have this kind of global culinary Feast, where they ship you ice cream.

219
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,500
It's delicious.

220
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,100
All the flavors are super interesting.

221
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:28,500
I am actually going to drop Marco ice cream in the chat, but we just love the name because I love Marco obviously, but that kind of stuff is we have the opportunity.

222
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:35,000
Now to Shameless plug, we have the opportunity to go find the founder and say, hey, why don't you do an experience?

223
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,100
Tell everyone about the founding story of Marco ice cream, and they kind of play playlist for each.

224
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,000
Ice cream.

225
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:49,000
And so that's one example, we do everything from kind of plant conversations with this, with this hose called free Plants.

226
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:54,700
Everything that you would think of we get the opportunity to from that the heavy stuff to the super light stuff.

227
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:00,900
We get we have the opportunity to bring those hosts on our platform and allow them to show their passions to the world.

228
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:08,700
So Ryan's asking if every one of us gets a pint of your ice cream there, we should have hit some ice cream.

229
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,100
I think it's the Maybe the next experience event is like will just totally ice cream and ice cream experiment.

230
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,400
Ice cream is absolutely delicious.

231
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,900
And so it's for us was we met we joke with the founders like what a great partnership.

232
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,000
We both love the name worker.

233
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,800
We both love ice cream.

234
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,700
So super fun.

235
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,800
Aaron, are there any other things that your teams are doing?

236
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,500
Yeah, well, obviously we use bonus lie.

237
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,000
So I think that really factors into, you know, feeling of being recognized and rewarded at work.

238
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:47,300
So another thing that we do we have very active slack channels, you know, we have a dog chat cat chat, hiking chat.

239
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,300
Things like that.

240
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,000
Hmm, and that's good.

241
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,700
Yeah.

242
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,700
It's a we try to get together whenever it's safe and also have any person happy hours.

243
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,000
But yeah.

244
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,600
So good.

245
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,700
Alright, let us move right into Q&A because I can see our virtual Safari guy.

246
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,300
Nate is in the green room.

247
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,100
So let us pull up that first question there, Josh.

248
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:22,700
From cat, how do you create a sense of belonging and engagement in the workplace without affecting the employees work-life balance?

249
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,700
Good question, answer that.

250
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:47,900
I think work-life balance has been very important on our team because, you know, it's a time when everybody has a lot of going on outside of work and I think that one of the most important things is to model work-life balance.

251
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:58,200
So things I do, you know, I try not to work late or I tried to get all my work done within business hours.

252
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,300
And if I do work afterwards, I don't think my team on slack.

253
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,500
I usually schedule the messages or, you know, save it for tomorrow.

254
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,200
Yeah, I guess for us.

255
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,800
I think we try to, and we're still working on this boat leading with flexibility.

256
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:26,000
So I actually think that now you might, you know, be in Tahoe and want to take a half-day to go skiing and then work late or work on a And to me, that's completely fine.

257
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So long as the work product is great.

258
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,600
And I think there's also an element of not kind of overreaching.

259
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:41,200
So we started this by talking about, you know, sharing and having the sense of belonging, but also respecting people's boundaries and what they want to keep within their personal life.

260
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,400
They should be able to write.

261
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:49,300
And I think now there's blurred lines between, you know, personal and professional life because everything's working all the time and every can jump on a zoom meeting whatever.

262
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,900
And, so I think just respecting boundaries is super important as well.

263
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,300
I think that's great.

264
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,200
Great points.

265
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,500
There.

266
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,900
Let us jump right into Kylie's.

267
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,700
Question.

268
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,200
Everyone on our staff is completely covered up by workload.

269
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,100
How can we create bonding connectivity when there's no time for activities?

270
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,700
So, I will jump right into this one.

271
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,000
Actually bonus.

272
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,400
Lee has been an amazing tool for our team, as we're cranking on our work and going meeting to meeting at times were able to recognize one another.

273
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,300
In a really easy way.

274
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:33,100
So, all of those recognitions actually go into our values, shoutouts lap Channel, and we're always looking at it.

275
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,500
And then what we do is actually call out those shout outs at our weekly all hands.

276
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:46,700
So we have our All Hands meeting on Friday and part of that run is show is to be able to recognize our team members and some of these things.

277
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:59,900
So, you know, being able to just get the asynchronous mentions and Figuring out where it's appropriate to bring up the synchronous mentions.

278
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
If that makes sense.

279
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,800
Am I think a really good way to cover that?

280
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Any other thoughts.

281
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,800
I guess one thought is for me making the time and prioritizing it from leadership.

282
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:23,900
And so as an example, we have our company Retreat, coming up in May and in previous Retreats, we have actually worked too much and not that enough creative time or kind of fun.

283
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,600
One time.

284
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,700
And it, what I, what I think is those moments in taking the time, actually pays a lot of dividends because it could be easy to say.

285
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,400
Oh my gosh.

286
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,700
I actually have to, you know, let us push the kind of connectivity experience.

287
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,900
And let us instead just focus on creating the slide deck, but I think it ends up creating business value to do this stuff.

288
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,500
If it's done in the right Cadence, right?

289
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,000
It shouldn't overwhelm folks.

290
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,900
That should be done at the right Cadence, but it actually I think will pay dividends for kind of company and kind of business value and showing that from leadership perspective.

291
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,600
Important.

292
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,600
Awesome.

293
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,100
That I think that's right on.

294
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,400
You know, I think yes, we can get overloaded with work, but we need to make time as Leaders as managers.

295
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,300
We have to make time.

296
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,300
If it's an off-site and your team needs that connectivity, fly him out.

297
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,600
It's worth the investment of that focused energy and time whether it's in person or whether it's virtual, so that is right on?

298
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Okay, we're starting to wrap up with time before our safari guide, but we could take one more question.

299
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,400
Shiloh because it's upvoted.

300
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,100
So high.

301
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,300
How can you comfortably include introverts in culture?

302
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,300
Oh, this is a good question.

303
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
I think I have a team of introverts.

304
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,000
I am an introvert myself.

305
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:52,000
So I think going back to that idea of not necessarily having direct engagement or forcing direct engagement with each other.

306
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:03,200
I think that you know, kind of creating a space where people can talk to each other or be as open as they want to be or as create the boundaries that they want to create.

307
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,700
But also, you know, making it very known that You know, Association is possible.

308
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:22,600
It's encouraged whenever you want it and just creating those spaces where we can work as a team together without needing to be in a sort of defensive position.

309
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Yeah, I guess it's funny.

310
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,600
I start off my fun fact because I am a twin brother.

311
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:36,500
My I am a super extrovert as you write tell if you know, I imagine your expert as well, and he's super introvert, so I can kind of challenge have this challenge my entire life.

312
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,500
It's really kind of, I think having respect for how people operate best.

313
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:47,500
I think the cool thing is now in this more distributed World, providing spaces, where introverts can speak up if they, if they want in the right.

314
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:55,800
Setting is perhaps easier because in a purely, we're in a world where you're always in person together the It's might shine, right?

315
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,000
They might be the ones who are always ready to order gold.

316
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,300
So they might only be the ones that are developing on their relationships and extra introverts by not.

317
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,600
So I think creating structuring the space methodically.

318
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,500
I think I totally agree and I think being in a virtual or hybrid circumstance, actually, empowers.

319
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:24,500
Introverts, to be able to chat to be able to ask the questions that normally if the extroverts in person are like overbearingly asking all the questions, they're able to have their voice heard.

320
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:30,700
Hurt in a virtual environment and I agree with Samantha what you said, you know, ask people what they want.

321
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,100
And that's where activities like strengths finder.

322
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,700
And getting to know your team members and how they're wired.

323
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,700
Myers Brigg, Enneagram.

324
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:43,700
All of these personality tests can really help, you get to know your team members and vice versa.

325
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,200
It's important for them to get to you as their leader as well.

326
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,400
So it goes both ways.

327
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,900
Well, these are awesome questions and answers.

328
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,100
Thank you so much.

329
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,500
Sue me.

330
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,700
Aaron for all your insights.

331
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:03,500
We're going to now bring up Nate our virtual Safari guide.

332
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,900
Join me up on stage to urinate.

333
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,800
He's coming up.

334
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
He's coming up.

335
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,400
All right.

336
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,300
Well, if the Beats eyeball waiting for Nate of there you are.

337
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,600
Hello, the flamingos.

338
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,500
Yep.

339
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,300
We're here at the Flamingo Pond.

340
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,100
I love it.

341
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,900
Wow.

342
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,300
So Nate, how long have you been guiding these virtual safaris and maybe in real life safaris as well?

343
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,600
Yeah.

344
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:43,400
Well, I started here at Safari West in, you know back in 2016 and virtual safaris were something.

345
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,800
None of us ever thought of until last year, of course.

346
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:55,800
And you know, it's not been an easy time for any of us, but zoos have a very specific problem in that, their overhead can't go.

347
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,900
Go down, you know, we have animals, we have to feed and care for at all times.

348
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,600
And a lot of that.

349
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,200
We do funded by guest experiences.

350
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:17,800
So when we had no way to bring people to our animals, we decided to bring our animals to them, and that's when we created this virtual Safari program last year.

351
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,900
I love it.

352
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,600
Well, we're all very excited for you to guide us through.

353
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Before we jump into your guide.

354
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,800
We do have a pole So Josh, if you could pull up bar Pole.

355
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,900
What is your favorite animal?

356
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,100
Let us just get a quick feel here to see what everyone's favorite animal is.

357
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,000
I am just going to say my name out loud.

358
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,500
I think I know what my vote would be.

359
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,900
What's yours?

360
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,100
I am glad we started here.

361
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,800
Oh, it's giraffe.

362
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Nice.

363
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,700
All right, what about the elephants?

364
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,100
I have.

365
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,800
We do it.

366
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,500
Tell if it's didn't make it to our poll?

367
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,300
But yeah, it looks like we have got a lot of draft fans and a lot of I love them all fans.

368
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,800
So this is going to be a treat for us.

369
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,100
That is the best answer.

370
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,500
Yeah.

371
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:09,900
All right, cool.

372
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,600
Thank you very much.

373
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,200
So we're going to profile, three animals that live here at Safari West.

374
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,700
Today.

375
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,500
We're starting off strong with a personal favorite of many of you.

376
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,600
It looks like according to our poll, the flamingo.

377
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,600
Now.

378
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
This is a live.

379
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Look right now.

380
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,700
I have got my camera posted right behind us.

381
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,600
Right here, pointed straight into the flamingo habitat.

382
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:42,100
These are African lesser, flamingos a little smaller in stature than the Caribbean, flamingos that you might see down at Florida, certain time.

383
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,400
Of year, but much more vibrantly colored.

384
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,300
Look at those fluorescent legs.

385
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,100
They're absolutely beautiful.

386
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,700
Now, flamingos.

387
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,200
They get their color much the same way.

388
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,000
A lot of bright red birds.

389
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,100
Do they convert beta-carotene in their diet into paint?

390
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,100
Pigment?

391
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,700
A lot of you may have heard that flamingos are pink because Eat.

392
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:35,800
It's a beta carotene and them and their bodies can express that beta-carotene as beautiful pink, that Flamingo sticks, its beak.

393
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:49,600
It's there's a filter inside its peak, the going to catch all of those tiny Christian I mention and that's the way it easy thing else.

394
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:55,400
Except okay.

395
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,600
That their legs appear to bend backward.

396
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,600
Go in the middle of his leg.

397
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
There were it is an ankle.

398
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:23,400
It's not an e, it's an ankle and it's kind of like when you stand on your tiptoes and your heel is right off the ground.

399
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,199
That's like the joint in the middle of their leg.

400
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,600
Yeah, but let us see.

401
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,199
From here.

402
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,199
It looks like we might have some questions coming in.

403
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,900
I can take some questions on flamingos, if anybody's got some.

404
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,199
If not, if we don't have any questions, I can roll right on through to our next animal.

405
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:55,600
Here.

406
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,900
We have another one that I want to feature today.

407
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,900
Its habitat is brand-new.

408
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,300
We just built it.

409
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,700
I will give you a hint.

410
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,400
What they are.

411
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,600
What is the pig with the longest legs in the world?

412
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
It's the warthog.

413
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,000
We have a beautiful habitat that we just built right over here nigiri and her daughter.

414
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,400
Lucy.

415
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Just moved in, and I am going to go ahead and pivot my camera, and we're going to do something really.

416
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,500
Fine, we're going to feed the warthogs together.

417
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,100
So just a moment here.

418
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,700
We're going to Pivot the camera.

419
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,300
All right.

420
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,100
There's our habitat.

421
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,700
We're going to head right over to that fence, and we're going to try to feed some warthogs today.

422
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,800
A big help.

423
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,600
They're going to move to the other side for me.

424
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,800
All right, here are our beautiful warthogs.

425
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,100
Again.

426
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:33,700
This is nigiri and Lucy right here mother-daughter pair, and we're going to step right up to the fence here.

427
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,800
We're going to feed them together.

428
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,000
Hey ladies.

429
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,300
Are you a little frightened?

430
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,300
Let us bring it back over with some of their favorite treats here.

431
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,700
We have got some romaine lettuce, which is an absolute favorite of theirs.

432
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,800
Nigerien Lucy.

433
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Only moved into this habitat about a month and a half ago.

434
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,800
Previously.

435
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,100
They were living back off stage another out front and center where I guess can come and see them.

436
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,800
You guys back for some tasty treats?

437
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,300
There we go.

438
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,200
One of the things that makes warthogs different from other.

439
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,400
Pigs is a Tusk where hogs have these big gigantic tusks.

440
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,700
You can see them right here.

441
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,300
They are modified teeth.

442
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:32,100
That grow way out of the sides of the mouth, that can be used to defend themselves from big predators.

443
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:46,000
They are one of the fastest members of the hog family top speed on these little warthogs is about 35 miles per hour, which I know blew my mama, and when I first heard it, because that's just crazy fast.

444
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,000
They are.

445
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,300
Well fast enough to get away from things that might want to eat them, which is a really important thing for him.

446
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,900
Oh, hi Lucy.

447
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,900
I am glad you guys warmed up to me.

448
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,700
There, you made me nervous for a second.

449
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:02,800
Now.

450
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,100
One reason.

451
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:15,300
I always feel the need to stand up for the warthog, is I think they get a pretty bad reputation as being animals, that are not cleaned and I don't know why people look down on them for this.

452
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,000
Yes, they spend all day rolling around in the mud.

453
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,900
But you might do, if you were a hog.

454
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,600
You see members of the hog and pig family.

455
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,200
One thing that makes them all similar is that they Cannot.

456
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,500
They're very, very happy with their new home over here.

457
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:55,300
And if they will stay by the fence, I will come back to my station here and see if we got any questions coming through.

458
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,300
All right.

459
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,200
I will look at those adorable pigs.

460
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,100
Lucy and particular is very energetic.

461
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:07,700
You guys might notice.

462
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,700
They have a sort of Moe.

463
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:43,600
All together, I think they deserve a little more credit than they get who do parents and children separate or do they stay together their whole life, you know that the female Offspring will stick around with the family for a while.

464
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,300
The male offspring will typically go out and do their own saying once they reach adulthood.

465
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,600
So yeah, great question.

466
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,500
Thank you, Kylie.

467
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,400
All right, let us get over here.

468
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,100
Elizabeth I am glad the Lion King's is popular in your house as it is in mind.

469
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,200
Love that movie.

470
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,900
Absolutely Lucy.

471
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,900
Where'd you go here?

472
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,400
Let me get her back on camera.

473
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,800
Oh, Lucy went and hid behind a tree, but we can get her mom.

474
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,600
This is nigiri.

475
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,800
She's beautiful too.

476
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,800
Let us get nice and close.

477
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,200
Now nigiri and Lucy are going to get a neighbor very soon.

478
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,800
In the next couple of weeks.

479
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:33,300
I Love Lucy to Colleen and that new neighbor is going to be our male warthog, whose name is pig Nuit.

480
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:40,900
I wish I could show you guys him today, but sadly, he still lives backstage, and he's getting introduced to the new habitat and very, very soon.

481
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,900
I know great name, right?

482
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,500
Yeah.

483
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,800
The girls came out here first, and they're doing great.

484
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,300
They absolutely love it.

485
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,100
That what they really love is they have a lot of new neighbors, you know.

486
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:56,800
Backstage.

487
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,200
It was just warthog town.

488
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,700
But out here they live next to a lot of really neat creatures.

489
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:15,600
One of their neighbors being The giraffe, some of my personal favorites.

490
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,500
The giraffe now.

491
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,100
Did you guys enjoy feeding the warthogs with me?

492
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:20,800
Was that fun?

493
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,900
Cool, would you guys like to do the same with the giraffe right now?

494
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,300
Awesome.

495
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:28,800
Okay.

496
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,300
I have got some of our giraffes favorite food, leaves of the acacia tree.

497
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,500
I have a very large bundle of it actually.

498
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,200
And we're going to go see if we can get their attention.

499
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,700
Alright.

500
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,700
Hey everybody.

501
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,300
I got your favorite snack.

502
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,900
Let us see here.

503
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,000
Oh, well, hi there.

504
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,900
This is little o.

505
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,100
Be obese about a year and a half.

506
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,500
Two years old.

507
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And this is little baby Leon.

508
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,800
Who's not a baby anymore?

509
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,200
Guys.

510
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,700
She's got to be close to two now as well.

511
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:27,500
And I am you have got to see me next to them.

512
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:27,800
Right?

513
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,100
For one and two year olds.

514
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,300
These are gigantic giraffe are never small.

515
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:37,700
At any point in the life cycle, giraffe are born, six feet tall and about 100 pounds.

516
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:46,700
They are huge gigantic enormous babies and their wobbly little things, but they usually up and walking in about 30 minutes or less.

517
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,700
For their born.

518
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,900
And then after that, you may have guessed.

519
00:42:51,900 --> 00:43:00,300
They almost double in size and the first year Gotta Be This Tall making me feel real short over here.

520
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,300
Now again, we do have their favorite food over here.

521
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,600
These are leaves of the acacia tree.

522
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,500
We grow this here at Safari West because we know how much the giraffe love it.

523
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,000
Of course, you know, we have about 900 animals here.

524
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,700
We can't grow enough on our 400 Acres, defeat everything.

525
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,500
But as many of their favorite treats that we can grow.

526
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,500
We do try to hear that guys.

527
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,200
Look at that tongue.

528
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,400
Did you guys know that the giraffe has a tongue?

529
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,900
That is almost an inch long for every foot tall that they are?

530
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,900
That means a full-grown giraffe at you know, 15 to 18 feet.

531
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,300
Tall has a tongue that is 15 to 18 inches long.

532
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,800
It is also prehensile, which means they can wrap it around things and pick them up.

533
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,500
Kind of like you're seeing them do with our branches here.

534
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,100
We want another one.

535
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,600
I am still chewing up there.

536
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,500
Something that's always blown.

537
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,100
My mind is the number of bones that the giraffe has in its neck.

538
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,500
You may know this, but human beings us, we have seven vertebrae in our neck.

539
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:08,200
That these little bone discs, that hold our spine together and shockingly, enough giraffe have the same.

540
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,200
Number giraffe, also have seven vertebrae in their neck.

541
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,800
Only, whereas ours are these little bone discs.

542
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,200
There's are these giant Antic phone logs.

543
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,700
Well, it looks like we might have a third coming to join us.

544
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,700
This is tarah over here.

545
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,300
Hey, Tara, how we do?

546
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,100
Would you like a snack?

547
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,800
We're going to think about it.

548
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,300
We're actually doing this a little bit special.

549
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,500
I am not sure if you notice they're a little hesitant.

550
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,900
We have actually not done giraffe meetings in this location before.

551
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,100
But special for our presentation today.

552
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:56,900
We thought we'd try this out and at least a little one, the one and two year, olds seem to be enjoying the new spot over here.

553
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:04,000
I should mention, the giraffe has one of the largest hearts of any land mammal on planet Earth.

554
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,300
A giraffe heart is on average.

555
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,800
Around 25 pounds, which is absolutely gigantic.

556
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,300
But there's a good reason, it's that big.

557
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,900
What is the hearts main job.

558
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,900
It's pumping blood throughout the body and particularly from the chest to the brain on this animal.

559
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,800
That's a distance of six to seven feet.

560
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,000
That's a big job.

561
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
That requires a very big heart and that's part of the reason why the drafts heart is as large as it is.

562
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,700
Alright, I am going to try to stick some of these in the fence here.

563
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,400
Keep them occupied and step back to you guys and get some more questions here.

564
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,800
Let us just make sure they get plenty of snacks because they certainly deserve it.

565
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,200
They have been great.

566
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,800
All right.

567
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,800
Excellent.

568
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,100
All right.

569
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,000
Okay, it looks like we did have some questions role in first one.

570
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,100
I am seeing here Colleen would like to like me to explain the nubbins.

571
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,600
If you're referring to the little things that stick up out of the top of the giraffe's head.

572
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,000
Those are called ossicones.

573
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,400
And you know what I should do zoom out just a little bit.

574
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So you guys are seeing them.

575
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,100
Let us see here.

576
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,900
There we go.

577
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,300
That probably ought to do it.

578
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,300
There we go.

579
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,400
So the giraffe has a horn like structure that sticks up out of the top of their head.

580
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,300
It is called a gnostic own, which is a word.

581
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,000
I didn't know.

582
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:56,700
Before I started working here, six years ago, but also cones are like a horn, but they're covered in skin and fur giraffe.

583
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,700
Were one of only two animals on the planet that have them.

584
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,500
The other one being called the Okapi, lesser-known forest, animal.

585
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,400
That comes from like deep in the Congo rainforest.

586
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,100
Now.

587
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,200
What are they useful for?

588
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,100
Have you ever seen a giraffe bike with one another?

589
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,200
If you haven't it's absolutely wild.

590
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,600
It's called necking to giraffe.

591
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,300
Will walk up side by side.

592
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:35,600
They will press the sides of their bodies against each other, and they will swing their heads in next to each other, as hard as they can use their head, almost like a wrecking ball to strike one another and that's as far as we know what they're useful for.

593
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,700
Now along with that, I always love to mention this fighting style might be.

594
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,200
Why giraffe or so Tall part of me.

595
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,900
If you grew up like me in school, you learned that giraffe or tall to eat leaves from the tallest trees.

596
00:47:51,700 --> 00:48:02,600
Well, that might not be the reason you know, the funny thing about animal Science Biology is that the new research comes out every single year and everything?

597
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,000
We learn about one animal changes, what we thought we might have known about another.

598
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:15,800
So a few years back, biologists noticed this really cool Critter called the gerenuk and the gerenuk are an antelope that has learned to stand on.

599
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,100
Its hind legs to reach higher.

600
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:28,300
Branches in a tree not as tall a branch is a giraffe but still higher branches by standing on hind legs if that's something that's possible for a four-legged animal.

601
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:34,800
Why then would the giraffe develop a 6-foot neck Instead, This one seemed easier than the other.

602
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,300
So we don't For sure, but it led us to start questioning.

603
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:44,900
Could there be another reason why the giraffe has such a long neck and that fighting style might be it?

604
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,900
You see male giraffe fight over taxes to female giraffe by swinging their necks it each other.

605
00:48:50,400 --> 00:49:03,500
If that's the case, doesn't it stand to reason that the Giraffe with the longest, strongest neck might win the most fights and if that's the case, wouldn't the Giraffe with the longest neck produce the most Offspring every generation.

606
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,900
Maybe that's why giraffe are so tall.

607
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,300
Or maybe it's the eating leaves from trees thing.

608
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,600
Or maybe it's a third thing.

609
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,200
That some young person today will grow up to learn about them to be teaching.

610
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:13,700
All of us.

611
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,200
One day.

612
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,400
That's the fun thing about studying animals.

613
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,000
Let us see.

614
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,800
Oh Ryan, you nailed it.

615
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,400
Ossicones right there in the chat.

616
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:23,900
Thank you.

617
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,100
Let us see.

618
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,300
Alexandria.

619
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,300
Okapi, babies are the cutest things I have ever seen.

620
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,100
They are great.

621
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,700
Danielle do asks a great question.

622
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,800
Do they sleep standing up?

623
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,100
Yes, director.

624
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,200
Do sleep standing up, can they sleep sitting down?

625
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,100
Sure, they can but it puts him in a really vulnerable position.

626
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:59,600
Giraffe takes so long to exit a seated position that if a lion comes Upon A seated giraffe that giraffes in really big trouble, right then and there but giraffe are capable of sleeping standing up.

627
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,400
So in most cases, that's what they're going to do because that's what safer.

628
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,700
All right.

629
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,100
Boo, and it looks like MJ managed to share some footage of giraffe necking.

630
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,200
Thank you so much for that.

631
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,600
It's always great to have a visual representation.

632
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,500
And sure Danielle.

633
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,800
You can keep calling them nubbins.

634
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,600
That's fine.

635
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,700
How did they not get tired sleeping?

636
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,100
No one's ever asked me that question.

637
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,300
That's a good question actually.

638
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,900
All right, cool.

639
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,300
Well while we're here, I am just going to share a couple more my favorite giraffe facts with you guys.

640
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,900
And if you have any other questions, please feel free to put them in the chat here.

641
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,200
One thing I always love to share is that the giraffe can kick tremendously hard.

642
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,900
If you just have what we did to go off of, you would probably consider the giraffe a gentle giant.

643
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,100
And for the most part.

644
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,300
They really are, but just like any other animal that's life is threatened.

645
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,000
The fight or flight response kicks in, and they're fast.

646
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,900
They can run like 35 miles per hour.

647
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,700
So maybe flight is the option but if fighting is the option, the giraffe delivers a kick.

648
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:08,400
So powerful that if it kicks a lion in the head, it will not just kill that lion.

649
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:13,700
It could very well shatter that Lion's skull which is just wild.

650
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,400
So don't ever think the giraffes a pushover.

651
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,300
They can take some pretty serious predators in a fight.

652
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,000
Now, let us see.

653
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,100
Jade asks, how do we tell them apart?

654
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,300
Great question.

655
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,500
Frankly.

656
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,100
It's because we have been spending so much time with them.

657
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,000
I mean, for one every giraffe has a unique spot pattern.

658
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,800
No, two are alike.

659
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,200
They're like human fingerprints.

660
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:43,200
So if you have a favorite giraffe, you could sort of memorize what its pattern looks like, for example, we have a giraffe that's got one.

661
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:50,100
Perfect heart-shaped spot on her butt, and we know that one is Kasia because of that.

662
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:50,700
Spot.

663
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,200
Now unfortunately, she's hanging out in the barn today.

664
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,500
So I can't show you guys her right now.

665
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:02,500
But yeah, if you have got a favorite spot, look for easily or a favorite drop, look for easily identifiable spots and that's a great way to figure out.

666
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,700
Who's who Samantha asks.

667
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,300
What is my favorite part of my job?

668
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,800
What I just did with you guys feeding the giraffe.

669
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,300
It is the most fun.

670
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:18,400
I think they're the most fascinating animals and I love getting to share my favorite things about them with folks, like you.

671
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,000
So that's probably my favorite thing.

672
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,400
Alicia asks, are they Anjali?

673
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,600
It's and have a modified me, it acts like a shelf allows for standing for long periods of time.

674
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,400
So yes, you know, I can't speak to the knee thing as much.

675
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,100
I am not quite sure how that works.

676
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,700
But yeah, you are, right.

677
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:39,300
They are Anjali.

678
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,700
It's and it sounds like you might know better than me how their knees works.

679
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,700
So, thank you for sharing that with the group.

680
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,100
What is the life expectancy of a giraffe?

681
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,000
We're talking about 18 years ish in the wild.

682
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,900
Longer under human care.

683
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:57,700
Our oldest giraffe right now is jamala, and she's about 26, and she's by no means a record breaker.

684
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,800
I think the oldest one in the United States right now is 31.

685
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,200
Alright from Pom-Pom.

686
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,000
How much do they eat in a day?

687
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,300
It's a lot.

688
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:15,000
I mean, they grow to what, like to 3,000 pounds by eating nothing but a beliefs that takes a lot of leaves.

689
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,500
I don't have a number on a deck.

690
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,300
Really?

691
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,100
How many pounds of food they eat a day?

692
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,300
I know our Rhino seat about 100 pounds of food every day, and I can't imagine.

693
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,800
It's nearly that much but it's a large number.

694
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,500
Let us see.

695
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,100
So, if the giraffe has a gnarly kick, would it be more dangerous for you to be in the warthog area or the De rap area?

696
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,600
That is an interesting question Jade.

697
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:45,300
It's probably going to be it depends on the individual, you know, just like in terms of people.

698
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:52,700
There's people that are a little bit, you know, shorter tempered, then others with animals.

699
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,700
There are some that are shorter temper than others.

700
00:53:54,700 --> 00:54:01,900
So if it's my choice between a friendly giraffe and a grumpy War Of course, I want to be out with the friendly giraffe.

701
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,300
If it's the other way around, then I want to be in the other habitat there.

702
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,400
So tricky question to answer.

703
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,400
I think it all would have to come down to the individuals temperament.

704
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,000
Not necessarily the species.

705
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,400
How much sleep do they need?

706
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,600
Not a lot, not a lot of sleep.

707
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,900
The in the wild.

708
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,200
They think they spent roughly 15 to 20 hours a day, eating and foraging.

709
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,300
That does not leave a lot of time.

710
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,200
I am left over for Sleep who names them.

711
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:37,900
Their Keepers, do the folks that you know, help them, give birth folks that feed them every day.

712
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,500
The folks that help them with vet care.

713
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,500
If they need it.

714
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:45,200
The ones that are here holidays weekends, all this time.

715
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,500
Making sure they're happy and healthy.

716
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:51,100
They definitely are in the right to name them and that's who gets to, alright.

717
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,700
Colleen will stick with flamingos.

718
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,800
All right, fair enough.

719
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,400
Well, thank you guys so much for your questions.

720
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:04,500
I had an absolutely great time showing you three of my favorite animals here.

721
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,500
I hope you enjoyed getting to feed them with me.

722
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,200
It's a lot of fun for me.

723
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,900

See that?

49
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,700
Taylor say something about?

50
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,700
They look awesome.

51
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,300
Well before we jump To the awesome tunes that you're going to be sharing with us today.

52
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,100
You know, some of us are just curious about your story.

53
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,100
Now, both of you are singer-songwriters from Louisiana, right?

54
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:03,900
Yes.

55
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,800
Tell us a little bit about your roots, you know, like Joven.

56
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,400
How did you get into music?

57
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:17,900
And we would love to hear the story of how you crushed American Idol auditions through the pandemic.

58
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,000
I mean, come on out.

59
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,600
That is it.

60
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,400
Incredible.

61
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,700
So, give us a little glimpse of your path.

62
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:32,600
How did, how did you get into music and how has Louisiana influenced you and Taylor feel free to jump into because I know you're from Louise, Louisiana as well.

63
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Um, basically my biggest influence would be Church.

64
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,600
My parents kept me in church when I was very young.

65
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:48,000
So just that's sold and culture of that from just Louisiana and general Inspire my soul to do the music I do today.

66
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,800
Awesome.

67
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,400
Awesome.

68
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,300
How about you Taylor?

69
00:10:52,900 --> 00:11:01,200
Yeah, for me, just being surrounded by the blend of country music and Soul music and gospel music, and southern rock music and all that things.

70
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,700
Just kind of came together into an amalgam of what I am doing now, rich.

71
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
So rich, we're excited to hear that.

72
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,600
So job and tell us a little bit about that.

73
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:28,300
Experience, auditioning for American Idol, through the pandemic, how, how that happened and have you been always trying to go after American Idol, like, we're their excellent amount of auditions that you had submitted before even getting to this.

74
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,000
Or was this your first time?

75
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,600
No, actually, I sent in an audition.

76
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:43,000
The year before is actually the year that lane Hardy won, and I was a little bit nervous to going from the judges or what the executives of that they had set forth.

77
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,900
So I sent in the video, and they actually liked it.

78
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:54,400
But at the time I wasn't really checking my email, so I missed that opportunity, but God had a plan to set me up for the next year.

79
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,500
So, I went in and just sing my butt off sweating, like I am doing now.

80
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,600
We're thicker email folks.

81
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,800
Basically check emails.

82
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,000
Well, yeah, that would that was not fun to miss that email.

83
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,900
I am sure I was crushed.

84
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,700
So then in 2020, how did you do the auditions?

85
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:24,200
Where you capture iPhone footage, selfie footage of yourself and submitting those like, what was that process?

86
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,600
Like, they sent those home from La.

87
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,400
Once they got the notice about the pandemic stuff, and they say, There's on the next day soon as we got there.

88
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,500
They start sending us equipment and start sending phone.

89
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,300
So we filmed the whole thing from three iPhone pros and that's how the show's made.

90
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,600
So I had to have family friends there just to help me do that.

91
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:53,100
Awesome about how many auditions did you do before you got in front of three, judges?

92
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,700
Oh God, I was like, at least for like six, at least.

93
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,900
Wow, so I did look, do a little traveling to went out to California.

94
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,500
First time.

95
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,400
I almost got left there.

96
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,700
That was interesting story.

97
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,800
What happened?

98
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:15,400
Basically my audition lasted longer than we were supposed to and I end up missing my flight and I had like a hundred bucks left to get home.

99
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,800
Yeah, that's another story.

100
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,300
Wow.

101
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,100
Okay, and what kind of tracks do you think?

102
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,500
You know, what was it about your sound that kept on advancing you through the auditions?

103
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,100
I don't know.

104
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,500
Thank you.

105
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,900
I guess everybody just kind of seen an and in heard of the pain in my voice and now he was authentic and it came from someone real, so they can relate to it.

106
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,000
So I am pretty sure everybody's been through a breakup.

107
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,400
So that's what the song was about.

108
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,300
Wow.

109
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:54,600
Yeah, I mean as a songwriter you have to pull from those deep experiences and emotions.

110
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,900
So with your sound that's what you have been able to.

111
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,400
Pull and really bring it out.

112
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,100
Well, that's awesome.

113
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,800
Are there any other questions from anyone in the audience?

114
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,100
Yeah, bring up some questions.

115
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:20,600
If you have any for jobin and throughout this event, if any of you, oh, who's the meanest judge?

116
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,200
None of them?

117
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,500
None of them.

118
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,000
They were, is that like you were dealing with Simon?

119
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,100
I mean, you did it with Katy Perry.

120
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,100
And she's like, bubbly, did see you got Uncle on an oh, that's kind of what it feels like to me.

121
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Uncle Lionel.

122
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:36,900
Right?

123
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,300
Right.

124
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,300
You look at Luke.

125
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,400
He's like, just a southern boy like us and feels like so, it was very a home feeling.

126
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,400
It wasn't like, I was meeting famous people even though they were megastars.

127
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:48,500
Yeah.

128
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,100
I mean, Katie had some pretty nice things to say about you.

129
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,800
And I mean, Lionel did to that one audition that you did in front of them.

130
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,200
What was that?

131
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,400
It?

132
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:06,400
What does that feel like just Going on to the American Idol stage, you have that, you know epic American Idol signage behind you?

133
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,900
How does that feel that whole experience?

134
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,900
It was a pretty nerve-wracking for what made the trip for me.

135
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,700
So crazy, just a whole journey.

136
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,200
I did the whole thing by myself.

137
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,600
So, when I traveled, I was by myself.

138
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,400
When I had to, you know, I was nervous.

139
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,100
I was by myself.

140
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
So, I was confiding myself.

141
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,500
Everybody else had somebody else.

142
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,900
So I was literally in a nutshell, freaking out, to be honest.

143
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,700
And something that didn't quite make.

144
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:46,100
The show was a I was outside a little nervous and I smoked the cigarette or something like that and I came in and I sing and I hug Kate, and she's like you a smoker.

145
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,500
I was like and Luke was that guy?

146
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,900
I think we need a smoker.

147
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,400
So that was like my biggest memories is like them asking me that it was like I was gonna need that grit that roughness.

148
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,100
So I don't know.

149
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,300
You just lied emotion that came out there one time and kind of blacked out for a minute.

150
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,500
Wow, that was a powerful audition.

151
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,400
Think a lot of us have seen that on YouTube.

152
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,200
All right, some questions here sod has asking what's your favorite City to play in?

153
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,500
Oh cool.

154
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,300
Is New Orleans.

155
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Alright flavor it?

156
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,400
Yes, the face is asking.

157
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,600
Who would you like to do?

158
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,700
A duet with and why?

159
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,300
I think we both can agree.

160
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,900
It will be Chris Stapleton.

161
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,400
Because Chris Stapleton is kind of like that guy.

162
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,100
That's helping bridge, the gap between country and blues, and soul rock and roll thing.

163
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,300
So when I, when I see him and somebody doing what he's doing, is almost a reflection of myself.

164
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
That's beautiful.

165
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
How about you Taylor?

166
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,100
Honestly, if I can do a duet with anybody, I wanted to do it with it.

167
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,700
Would either be Susan Tedeschi or Brandi.

168
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,300
Carlile.

169
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,900
Nice choices.

170
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,000
Wendy is asking.

171
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What was the biggest life learning from this experience with American Idol?

172
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,700
It's a good question.

173
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:24,300
Um, The basically where I took most from it was to start believing myself.

174
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,800
You guys don't know who I am.

175
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,900
I am a very known to be kind of timid and laid-back and shy and introverted.

176
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,500
But when I am on that stage, I am different and it's kind of thing.

177
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,300
I need to balance.

178
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,600
It's like I need to just learn to believe in myself in.

179
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,800
And that's where that show has.

180
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,000
Taught me is like up all hours of the night learning stuff and just pushing yourself to the limit.

181
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,200
So, Basically, I learned to keep going jover Duty.

182
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:09,500
So then I think all of us could take a little note, a tip from that as well as to believe in ourselves, you know, especially in such a time as this where there's uncertainty there's volatility and you know around the globe and you want.

183
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:17,000
One thing we can do is believe in ourselves and you know, be thankful for each day that we have and get after it.

184
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,600
So, I love that.

185
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:31,100
Christian is asking, what do you feel keeps upcoming musicians and songwriters for making it interesting question, what prevents them from making it?

186
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,700
Just I guess not being able to relate.

187
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,200
I mean if you don't have anybody that.

188
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:46,200
So the thing I learned singing gospel music and being in church is that you can have a really good singer sing a song.

189
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:59,600
But if they don't feel it, if people don't receive it that way, then it's not going to go over well basically, so if you're not writing something that's going to touch somebody, so make them cry or whatever that emotion that your time, projected ain't going to work.

190
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,600
It's good.

191
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,700
It's got to be authentic.

192
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,400
Yes.

193
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:14,300
That's why I think when you said pulling from a deep place and a an authentic experience like that, that shines through when you do that, when you tap into that.

194
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:23,700
All right, our last question here from semenko, how has your family loved ones and Friends, reacted to your newfound success.

195
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,800
Oh God, they love it.

196
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,700
But I am sure they over at this point.

197
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,800
I am sure the old a whole thing is like we can't.

198
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,300
I mean it's his home.

199
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:46,100
So I am very happy that people notice who I am but it can't get a little nerve-racking especially when they just try to enjoy our family time and somebody comes up and say something like this is what I signed up for.

200
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,800
So I think they love it.

201
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
They just like I broke.

202
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,400
Hmm.

203
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,600
And you have a little son.

204
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,800
Yes.

205
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,100
Name, how old is he?

206
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,400
Jayven will be Jamie.

207
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,900
Did Shane will be six years old.

208
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,200
He was born on my birthday.

209
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,300
Sal's my present.

210
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,600
Wow.

211
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,500
What a special kid.

212
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,000
Does he have?

213
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The same pipes?

214
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,800
Are you?

215
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,200
We don't know yet.

216
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,400
We're going to find out because you know, what are you doing in Rome?

217
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,500
I am not going to work with them.

218
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,800
We'd love to have the daddy son duet on one of our events.

219
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,500
One of these days.

220
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,500
All right.

221
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,600
Well, Everyone's waiting for this moment.

222
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,300
So Joven if you and Taylor could take it away.

223
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,200
It sounds like you guys have a few tunes that Taylor's going to be doing.

224
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,500
And then a few tunes that job and you're going to do.

225
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,000
So, we're super excited for this, take us away.

226
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:53,200
You made a killer point about, you know if you're not feeling it, it's not going to be real kind of whole thing about people resonate with something.

227
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,700
If it's, if it's something you lived in, you know, and you're singing from a Place.

228
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,200
And so this first song is called lion.

229
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,200
And it's about when you're being cheated on and, you know, it, but you can't prove it.

230
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,100
I have been there.

231
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:24,300
I got a feeling that something's wrong.

232
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,100
Once you're kissing me reeling.

233
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:36,000
But lately the magic song, I think there's a problem.

234
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:50,300
I can't seem to find that look in your eyes baby that I used to see all the it's cause you didn't.

235
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,700
I am here, she been lying.

236
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,800
Even lying next to my new Bridges to do.

237
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,000
Everything is alright, but I know something's wrong with you.

238
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Even lying next to somebody new and you're lying.

239
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:50,100
It don't take a genius, just see things to change between us and never will Hangzhou girl.

240
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,700
Something's missing love is not easy.

241
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:06,400
Hey, you gotta know where some levels, but somehow I feel like I am.

242
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:15,600
Yes, you have been lying even lying next to somebody.

243
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,000
And you're lying.

244
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:06,200
Somebody new and you lie to me.

245
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,700
So yeah, that's definitely a song.

246
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,600
I have lived through singing from that place.

247
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:43,100
Where you know something dirty is going on and you just can't prove it, but, you know, it in your gut, it's not a good place to be.

248
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,600
And this next one?

249
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,800
Is another one that I didn't live per se but I watched it.

250
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,000
I watched it being lived and it hurt deep to see it.

251
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,100
It's a song about my brother.

252
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:10,400
I got a little brother who's been in and out of addiction for a long time, heroin and different things and it resulted in him being homeless and I never know where he is most of the time.

253
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,700
And I wrote this song, kind of trying to put myself in his shoes.

254
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:23,100
And so what y'all think it's called water under the bridge?

255
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:38,800
I am through the smoke and I have drank my last bottle.

256
00:25:42,300 --> 00:26:07,000
I have spent 15 years old on this road because sometimes you choices and burn down your own, but that's what I have made my bed now, I will sleep in it when it rains it, pours.

257
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:18,300
It is what it is under and be it's a hard place to be.

258
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:32,000
Begging for change selling newspapers and who I am?

259
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,500
Sometimes the weather can't mess up.

260
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,600
You plant.

261
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:45,500
That's what made my baby sleep in.

262
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,100
Is world.

263
00:26:53,100 --> 00:27:03,800
It is the rain pouring down.

264
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:09,400
I try to drown out the sound under ayat.

265
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,800
I can't.

266
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:28,100
That's what water under the bridge time.

267
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,600
Made my bed.

268
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,200
Now, I will sleep in the when it rains.

269
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,400
It.

270
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,500
Pours.

271
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
It is what it is.

272
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,900
Under the wreath.

273
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,800
Now we're going to do one together.

274
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,100
Now.

275
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,500
It's another one.

276
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,100
I wrote in the kind of like my message to the world.

277
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
If I had just one thing to say to the world before I died.

278
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,500
This would be it and I think it's the vices and I love the way he does the other half of it.

279
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:30,100
And he just learned this like yesterday, like today last night, and he's, he did it.

280
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,800
He did a great job.

281
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,300
He nailed it.

282
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,600
So this one's called, just like you.

283
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,400
They all come into this world the same way.

284
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,400
We have all got Mama's to think when we were kids.

285
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,100
We'd play with anyone now, rage.

286
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:04,000
Didn't matter what Rings somewhere along the way.

287
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,400
We left things, people tell me more than people themselves.

288
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:17,500
If we don't turn off the news and find better things to do, life might be more like heaven.

289
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:49,100
If you say, we're all gonna die.

290
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:16,900
I have learned from the time cuz he — in the dark never way you do.

291
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:43,500
If you love me.

292
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,500
Yeah.

293
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,500
Jeremy.

294
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:30,300
I mentioned my love for Chris Stapleton, so this next song is about him.

295
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,400
Kick it off.

296
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Say my share of broken a Lowe's told you we that used they were gone wherever they go f****** hate it.

297
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,800
And just come down from the heavens.

298
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:22,300
Just to help her come to teachers and it helps a mother.

299
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,100
See myself walking a lows.

300
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,500
So, did we?

301
00:32:39,300 --> 00:33:08,000
If I go wherever they go looking Halos, that you don't go looking.

302
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:25,700
And for the reasons, why don't you lay eggs in diesel and I miss, you know, the answer they belong.

303
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,900
The Whitney.

304
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:01,700
Rockin a knows that he's working.

305
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:18,900
Late knows that he used to A little homage to the late great, Stevie Ray Vaughan, but I feel it.

306
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,600
If I could just talk about the soul and a route to this song is definitely a southern born and raised.

307
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,300
So let us keep some of that from the barbecue sauce.

308
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,800
I love and giving sight to the blind.

309
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,100
My baby love and causes Sunshine.

310
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:18,100
She's my pride and joy, she must be little baby.

311
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,600
I am her little lover boy.

312
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,800
Let us meet the man.

313
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,300
She's my pride and joy.

314
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,700
Dig Me Up.

315
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,100
My sweet little thing.

316
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,400
Yeah.

317
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:42,800
Yes.

318
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,100
He is.

319
00:36:43,100 --> 00:37:07,200
My pottinger is my pride and joy.

320
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,900
Little baby.

321
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,000
I am her little lover boy.

322
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,100
So we got one more tune.

323
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,100
Of course, you know, they're doing all covers.

324
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,700
This is Into the Mystic.

325
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,900
I guess what, I get from this song is just talking about it.

326
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,500
We won't buy one for the win.

327
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,900
Awesome.

328
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,600
So, younger than this house?

329
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:18,300
With everybody bows, one sitting into the mystery of my here.

330
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:32,900
The city's smell the season at Isola spherify, still into the mystery.

331
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:45,500
And that far gone, blows coming home?

332
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:59,300
That's all I have to feeling now.

333
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,400
I could even win in the days of old.

334
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,100
There are souls.

335
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,900
Beautiful sailing Into the Mystic.

336
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,000
Coming home.

337
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,500
Then if you feel really nice.

338
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:33,700
Jabra.

339
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:03,400
There's always more song with you always moves to split it.

340
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,800
Yeah, I will do the first verse you.

341
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:20,600
The second one sounds of that ain't no sunshine.

342
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,800
When she's gone.

343
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,800
It's not warm when she's away.

344
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,700
And no sunshine when she's gone.

345
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,600
She's always gone too long anytime.

346
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,700
She goes away.

347
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:52,400
Wonder if she's gone.

348
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,400
Let us go too long.

349
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,700
Darkness everyday ain't no sunshine.

350
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,900
When she's gone, and she's always gone too long.

351
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,400
One in this time when she's gone.

352
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:35,800
Wondering if she's gone to stay, ain't no sunshine when she's gone.

353
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And this house just ain't no home.

354
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,400
Anytime.

355
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,000
She goes away.

356
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:54,000
I know, I know.

357
00:44:54,300 --> 00:45:04,200
No, I know downstairs are when she's gone?

358
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,100
It's not warm when she's away.

359
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,900
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.

360
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,800
And this house just ain't no home.

361
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,300
Anytime she goes away.

362
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,300
Anytime.

363
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,200

5

9
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,500

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,200

00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,300
In The Help tab.

17
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,100
All right, so jumping into today's program.

18
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:15,700
We're going to start off with an amazing panel, with a couple of great leaders, Roberto Ortiz, co-founder and CEO of welcome and Jason from bucket list, rewards.

19
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:31,400
They have a lot to share with us their, and then we're going to end our time with Marta from marvelous, where she's going to walk us through a mental emotional exercise, and you're going to feel grounded and well, Balanced coming out of this time.

20
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,900
So, does that sound good?

21
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,500
I would love to see you in chat.

22
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,000
If you guys are resonating.

23
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,700
Give me, give me a firechat.

24
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,800
Give me something a fist bump, what not.

25
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,100
Thank you, Madeline.

26
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,900
There we go.

27
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,200
Alright, people feel in this cool.

28
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,100
So, you know, talking about our panel.

29
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:58,600
There's some Gallop stats that I am sure some of you are familiar with, but nearly 85 percent of employees, worldwide are not engaged at work.

30
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,300
I That's a crazy staggering number.

31
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:10,300
And so, you know Gallup will mention that the number one reason why these engagement programs or whatnot.

32
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:18,600
Our failure failing not working is because Employee Engagement is not owned by the leaders themselves.

33
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,800
It's not an expectation held on managers, or is it fully understood by employees?

34
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:36,900
And so that's why I am so excited to bring up Roberto and who are leaders, their CEOs, co-founders, who are infusing Employee Engagement into the DNA of their companies.

35
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,200
So, would you join me, Roberto and Jason on stage?

36
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,900
Hi, thank you both.

37
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,400
How are you?

38
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,300
Doing great.

39
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,800
I did Dean II.

40
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,500
I am always amazed by the energy.

41
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,800
You bring to the stage, and I am always like thinking about when I jump on stage.

42
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,700
I am probably not going to be able to keep up.

43
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,800
But here we are.

44
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
I am glad to be here.

45
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,200
Jason.

46
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,600
Thanks for taking time to be here as well.

47
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,200
I am looking forward to the topic.

48
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,400
Its top of mind for leaders at every company.

49
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,300
Is this idea of just employee experiences Talent retention?

50
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,300
How do we drive?

51
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,300
The right coaches, we want in our company, so I am here for, I am glad to be here.

52
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:47,700
Hey Jason, you know, I think what's interesting if both of you can maybe intro and kick this panel discussion off with the DNA of your companies because I do think just like I shared with that Gallup step, you know, a lot of the failures of Employee Engagement programs is due to the lack of ownership at the leadership level.

53
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,500
But both of you are passionate about your employees about your people.

54
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,600
And I know that firsthand with Roberto Jason the moments that I have Able to engage with you.

55
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,200
I can feel the passion off of you and you're constantly thinking about Gentiles.

56
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,800
So, could you both speak to your organization's?

57
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,100
Just a little bit, like what you all do?

58
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,200
And how Employee Engagement is infused in your DNA?

59
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,500
Yeah, I would be happy to and Jenna.

60
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,000
Thank you so much for the really warm welcome.

61
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,100
I Deco I love the energy and it's just a pleasure to be participating in to today's session.

62
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:32,100
I will maybe give you the 30-second overview into bucket list and just a little bit a couple of reasons why it's so important to me personally.

63
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,000
Well buckets rewards is an employee rewards and recognition platform.

64
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,700
And I think as everybody here, probably knows, when you take great care of your employees, they stick around longer, and they perform better.

65
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,300
At the heart of our platform.

66
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,000
That's what it's all about.

67
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,600
It's about recognizing outstanding contributions and really rewarding people in a meaningful way.

68
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,800
Ideally, try to make dreams come true, whether they are small or very, very big and culture for me is from day one.

69
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,500
This is a third tech company.

70
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:11,100
I built it scaled over the years and the theme I have seen time and again, is it always comes down to the people surrounded by the Mission Vision and values.

71
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,200
And if you get that right, you can create an Unstoppable force and have just a ton of fun in that Journey as well.

72
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,000
So, that's kind of little bit about me and why cultures important.

73
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,200
But Rob, I would love to get your insights on this as well?

74
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,200
Yeah.

75
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,600
Yeah.

76
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,300
Thanks, Jason.

77
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,000
I love making dreams come true.

78
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,900
That's super aspirational.

79
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,000
I love it, you know, over, I mean at welcome.

80
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,600
You guys first of all, welcome to welcome.

81
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,900
This is our platform.

82
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,500
What we do on our side is we partner with companies that care about employee experiences and help them.

83
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,200
Form these Keystone employee experiences to having engaging ones.

84
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,300
All right, and we know that the distributed Workforce.

85
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,900
We have to be much more intentional about every touch point with our employees, right on that employee Journey.

86
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,100
There are these Keystone experiences that should be elevated, and we should make every meeting count.

87
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,700
And I think that's, that's one of the key drivers for us in the season to supporting companies like that.

88
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,600
At a high level though.

89
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:17,200
We are also accompanied ourselves, not just supporting companies Drive, amazing experiences and Nature but also on my side I think about this every single day.

90
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,600
How do we make sure that our employees during the right position to thrive?

91
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,900
Not just at work but at home and I think that the at-home part has become so important.

92
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:45,500
Now, I think this last couple of years people have taken the opportunity to assess things in a real way, assess what's important to them, assess just distribute like the distribution of work and the flexibility that comes with that.

93
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:52,400
And I think what is required of us as Leaders is to be mindful about that and not just, hey, what are you executing at home?

94
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,500
I mean, at work, we're all.

95
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,200
So, what are you executing at home?

96
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:03,200
And I think for us as we're building the culture at welcome, we take that to heart and it's about the entire employee.

97
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,900
Not just what they can do for us.

98
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So good.

99
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:18,300
I love to hear of just the authenticity of this passion heart actually being threaded in the DNA of the organization.

100
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,600
So, thank you for sharing that.

101
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:36,700
You know, we are in this employee era where retaining employees is obviously the top topic and organizations need to do things differently and probably need to be a little bit more intentional about the way they look at employee.

102
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,300
The engagement.

103
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,300
What are some things that both of you are seeing that successful organizations?

104
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,000
Your customers are doing for hybrid teams today?

105
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,300
Yeah, I am robbed.

106
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,900
You want to leave?

107
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,800
Go first, sir.

108
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,500
Are you can, you can go for it?

109
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,300
I think thank you.

110
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,100
Thanks very much.

111
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:04,300
Um, I will share some experiences that we have implemented but also share some things we have seen some of our customers doing as well.

112
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:22,500
So in also tied to that bucket list were recognized as one of the top 50 best corporate cultures in Canada, and I don't mention that as a bragging I am super proud of it, but it's just a, it's a measure of all the things we have implemented internally.

113
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:41,800
That's culture is as I mentioned before so near and dear to what we do but I the two stories are two quick examples that I have seen have a big impact is first, I think it's super important to be so intentional about the whole employee experience, and something we have done, is we have taken the time to map it, map it out, and its entirety.

114
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,900
So, everything from the first touch point, so when somebody sends in their resume for Sample to a job to the first interview.

115
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,800
Second interview.

116
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,200
We have mapped out before they start day one week, one, 30 60 90 days.

117
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
And once that was all mapped out.

118
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,700
We then surveyed staff as they go through that entire cycle to find out where we're strong.

119
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,900
They were weak.

120
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:08,400
And when you uncover these weaknesses in your employee experiences, your then better and power to up to address those things.

121
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,300
And so we have been able to create a really repeatable scalable employee experience for all our staff.

122
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,000
And then the second thing we did.

123
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:25,000
In tandem with that is, we made it a one of our corporate rocks to have a, an absolutely delightful employee onboarding experience.

124
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,000
Specifically, we decided to survey all new employees joining the team.

125
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,200
And our goal was to score 9 out of 10 or higher.

126
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,000
And after two quarters of running the survey.

127
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,800
We have an average score of about a nine point six out of ten.

128
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
And I think it that's just as a result of being.

129
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,600
So deliberate about mapping the entire experience out, identifying the weaknesses.

130
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,700
And then also we made it pop, we made the leaders publicly accountable, and we shared everybody's results publicly.

131
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,200
So like I am holding leader.

132
00:14:53,900 --> 00:15:03,200
The onboarding leader like we held their toes to the fire if you will to be super accountable to providing a delightful experience, but those are just a couple of things we have done.

133
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,800
Yeah.

134
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,300
Yeah, Robert over to you sir.

135
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,400
Yeah.

136
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,900
Yeah.

137
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,600
I love that.

138
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,700
I love the taking the surveys.

139
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,300
After every employee on board.

140
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,000
We do some very Lawyers, well, I think you know, the way we have been mapping it out.

141
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,900
We think about it as an employee success in general, right?

142
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,800
And the idea that companies have a so much time.

143
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,600
So much energy into customer success.

144
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:43,600
It's an entire sometimes at companies and is one of the biggest teams it makes up one third of a company's head count many ways, and they exist only to make sure that the customers to cuss well, and then the question we're asking is like, what does that look like for our employee success?

145
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,800
And so, Jason back to your point of map and Entire employee Journey.

146
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,200
We were looking at these the same thing and asking the question.

147
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,600
Okay, how do we put those same levels intention into equipping?

148
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,200
Our employees to be successful retaining them and helping them Thrive.

149
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,800
What does that look like and mapping out those touch points?

150
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,500
I think what we're seeing also just in the market in general because we see a lot of companies.

151
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,700
We partner with a lot of companies that are in this space, right?

152
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,500
I am talking to HR leaders every day.

153
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,000
I am talking to people that are part of internal.

154
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:25,800
I am saying trying to drive these employee experiences and what I am finding is that It's just the top item in conversation.

155
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,700
Like it's a top item in conversation.

156
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:34,800
And but there's a big gap as well between angry when you talk about holding toes to the fire of leaders.

157
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,100
I think that's really important.

158
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,400
Right?

159
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Like top five issues across the board for HR leaders.

160
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
There's a few of them that you think about it.

161
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,200
It's like, how do we make sure that we actually drive change forward?

162
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:57,800
So, for instance, you know, there was this Gardener report at one of Do the top five, one of them I recall was future of work at the top of my conversation for everybody.

163
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:09,300
Distributed, Workforce is top of my conversation, but less than 40% of people feel like they have actual plan to address the shifting landscape, right?

164
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:20,000
And so what we're seeing our customers do is actually put a lot of intention behind that and drive, not just technology, but experiences of those employees forward.

165
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,600
So for instance, you know, one of our Murmurs, they're being super intentional about hosting these monthly employee company-wide experiences.

166
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,200
Why?

167
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:44,100
Because you're for that remote employee for a distributed Workforce that person is going from their bed to their desk and then back to the kitchen and sort of that's like their commute.

168
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,400
It's just a couple steps away and there's isolation that case in and all these other things that kick in.

169
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,100
And so no longer are the perks of Beautiful office.

170
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,900
I used to work at Google and it was fantastic.

171
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:00,700
Going from the third floor to the first floor on a slide and grab your latte on the way to the next meeting.

172
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,000
All that goes away.

173
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,800
All that goes away.

174
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,800
So what it does it make it so that us as Leaders?

175
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:13,800
We have to actually provide value beyond the perks and that just invites deeper conversation.

176
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:24,400
And so what we're seeing our customers do is be intentional about the space, be much more intentional and I think you know, with folks that are shown Own up today and sort of events that we posted the past.

177
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:32,300
And the future is evident that people are looking for ways to solve and close the gaps of Employee Engagement and culture.

178
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:45,300
So anyway, I will stop there Gina, but super, super exciting to see sort of the intention sort of surface to the top and maybe it was a crisis that made it happen.

179
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,000
And say, hold on the things that's most important is our people.

180
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,600
We have to put more attention about this.

181
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
What does that look like?

182
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,000
And so that's what I have been seeing.

183
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,000
On my side, you know, I want to pull a thread a little bit more.

184
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,100
You were both talking about holding leadership accountable.

185
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Now if that statistic from Gallup says that the number one reason to failure of Engagement programs is because a lack of ownership from leaders, how are you all doing that today?

186
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,700
How do you keep the leaders accountable to driving these initiatives forward?

187
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,800
I will start off with Jesus.

188
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:27,300
You took the last one and I think, I think it starts with us, right at the end of the day.

189
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,200
Founders and CEOs, the buck stops there.

190
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,800
And, so I think that we just have to take ownership of what's right?

191
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,500
And what's wrong for us.

192
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:51,400
We do a quarterly post survey, and we just got results recently, and they're not the ones I was looking to continue to crush and continue to grow and it's like, okay, like we got some work to do.

193
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,800
And the question is, what do I do about that?

194
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,300
Do I say?

195
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:54,500
Okay.

196
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:08,200
I am just going to keep taking customer calls and investor calls and Keep working on the product feature, or we can actually put more intention and keep growing employee satisfaction and I think it starts and stops there Gina, I think from a leadership perspective.

197
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,000
Then it becomes that from there're managers.

198
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:25,600
And the idea that your managers are actually, you know, when I am interviewing managers, and I am thinking about this, you know, they're responsible for a big portion of your people in many times, in many ways.

199
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,900
They're responsible for the culture that Is marinated in there.

200
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:39,900
Something you can say from the top and say, these are our core values as a difference in terms of the practicality of that being carried out at the team level and at the individual level.

201
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:47,500
And, so I think it starts at the top and then it goes right into the management and I think measuring things is what we have to do.

202
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:59,200
So for us, looking at Polk survey, whether their quarterly or more frequent and that having skip levels, so that we understand sort of not just for more direct reports what's happening, but also, So, what are other folks?

203
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,700
That other organizations that you typically don't have time with?

204
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,700
How do you break bread with them and understand?

205
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,800
Hey, how can we improve your job?

206
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,700
How can we improve the work that you're trying to do, and what you're trying to accomplish?

207
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:17,700
And so, I think it starts with us at the top and then obviously our Frontline managers to be held accountable.

208
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,500
Yeah, I think that's a super good summary Rob.

209
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,600
I may decide just a couple of bullet points that even Echo a lot of the key things.

210
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,100
Saying, but like are saying is like the fish will rot from the head down.

211
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:40,900
So unless your leadership really walks to talk, like you're not going to get buy-in alignment and I truly believe everything kind of Rises and falls with leadership as well.

212
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:52,300
So leaders have to be accountable for the failures and also ideally push down the winds to the team, but in terms of creating accountability, I think there's a lot of systems and processes you can do to drive down accountability.

213
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,600
So it's not just the seat does.

214
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,000
This should not be should not rest just on the CEOs shoulder.

215
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,600
They should be the champion up there.

216
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,900
We should be the torchbearer.

217
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:06,600
I believe in and around culture, but a good CEO should create alignment and simplicity around these sort of goals.

218
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:14,100
And so, for example, as I mentioned before setting a quarterly goal, that's public you shared with your company or your team.

219
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,800
So, we use okrs objective key results.

220
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,100
We know whatever your company may do.

221
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,800
I highly, Advocate sharing those publicly not, just with the leadership team, but the entire company.

222
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:32,000
And so we have our, okay, ours, this That typically sit with the leadership team and there will be a Leaders name assigned to it.

223
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:47,500
We talked about those every week, and we say whether the green yellow or red and then on a monthly basis, we share our progress with the entire company and a company wide, how everybody can kind of full transparency on whether we're green yellow or red fork over a great culture.

224
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:55,000
And there's the result when you stay at a goal publicly and then attach some of these name to it and then see what you're on track or off track.

225
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
That's a beautifully.

226
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,600
Simple way to drive accountability.

227
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,500
You know, it's we have had a lot of, we have had a lot of success with that.

228
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:07,200
And again, it anchors into that the public transport were super transparent about everything we do here.

229
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,500
So, I am a big believer of that.

230
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:19,000
When you say on track or off track, what are some examples of quantifiable ways that you can track the success of Employee Engagement.

231
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:27,600
So for example, the onboarding goal of getting an, a score of 9 or higher out of 10, that score was made public with the entire.

232
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:35,600
You so green scored benign or higher, a yellow scored kind of be 7 point 5, to 8 in red is sub 7.5.

233
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,100
So that's attached a number to it.

234
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,600
Make it green, yellow, or red and then share it with everybody.

235
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,800
So they can see how we're doing.

236
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:43,700
This.

237
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:50,300
Really inside bar, color coding is really motivational, like you could you can be had an outstanding result.

238
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,700
But if it's in the red people do not like that.

239
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,500
Whether you're a sales rep, whether you're ahead of culture, you only find him.

240
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,900
People simple markers that are shared with the team can again drop performance and accountability.

241
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,000
So That's a great tip.

242
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,300
Thank you for that.

243
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,000
Both of you.

244
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,200
We're going to go into Q&A.

245
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,900
I, it looks like we actually do have some questions coming in.

246
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,700
Oh, this is great.

247
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,100
All right.

248
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,000
First question is from Spencer.

249
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,100
It's for you Jason.

250
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:25,200
What were some of the weaknesses you uncovered in your onboarding process that you think everyone could learn from?

251
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:33,000
So I am gonna, I am gonna go big picture, obvious ones, and I will talk about some more recent ones because we're constantly surveying for feedback.

252
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:42,900
So, Early in the process prior to building a true culture part of me prior to hiring for and Building Systems people and systems.

253
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,800
Cultures.

254
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,900
One of the things we did.

255
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,500
That's so obvious that I think everybody will know, but it's embarrassing and it's for the sake of transparency.

256
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,200
I will mention it.

257
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,000
We ghosted some of the candidates who applied with us.

258
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,400
So like sometimes people would apply, and we didn't reply to everybody since we have committed to providing a really transparent high-level communication.

259
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,800
Everybody gets a response.

260
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,900
So there's no ghosting in the application process.

261
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,400
Process.

262
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:18,600
I know that one's kind of obvious but for my informal and formal research, it's a pretty common theme that a lot of companies are guilty of that and that I also was guilty of and then more recently, I have as our systems, become more evolved.

263
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Some we're getting really granular, and we're starting to appreciate how we onboard different team members matters.

264
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:38,200
So at first we had a one consistent kind of onboarding process that I thought was pretty sweet, but for example in sales, the sales team will teach them in the Worried about Discovery demo and Etc, but it turns out on day one.

265
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,700
They really want to get a big picture of exactly how the product works.

266
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,800
They want to see like what the heck they want context.

267
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
What the heck, am I selling?

268
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,100
So in that last piece of feedback, I shared that was based upon.

269
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,300
I did a met with some of the new account Executives who just met joined our team.

270
00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:03,400
And I would ask them like, where we strong, where we weaken our onboarding, and they share, there's a bunch of great stuff, but they had shared having detailed insights into exactly other product works from day.

271
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,600
One would be early viable.

272
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,500
So those are just kind of too top of mine things that I have seen recently.

273
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,000
I would add on to that, just a bit.

274
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,700
I had a great conversation with another CEO about comparing notes about onboarding and interviewing.

275
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:27,600
And I think it's worth were saying that especially in this market like Your time as a Founder.

276
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:37,900
As a leader, jumping on calls, with candidates jumping on cost, to close them, jumping on costs, understand like what their goals are, even beyond your company, I think is super important.

277
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:48,500
And so making time for that Canada to feel like you can say like I really want this candidate, but if they don't feel they're on the other side, it's not real.

278
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,300
It's not real.

279
00:26:49,300 --> 00:27:16,400
And, so I make time to show up for those candidates who are making a big decision, you know, when I am interviewing And by the way, all of our Founders three founders, we interviewed every single candidate at welcome, we committed to until we can no longer because of time, time constraints, but we're going to keep doing that for as long as we can and, you know, at the end like part of the last interview, and I am typically doing the last, the last touch point on an interview at that point.

280
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,600
I am just really just getting to know the person story.

281
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:26,000
So they're coming in prepped with all their things and sort of all the tough because my team, I really trusted my team has done their due diligence.

282
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Diligence on this candidate at this point.

283
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,800
I just want to get to know who she is.

284
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,300
Like what's like, what's your biggest challenge right now?

285
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,100
Even Beyond welcome, how can we help like, what does that look like?

286
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:45,700
And just get to know them and their story and I think us being able to even like make sure that everyone that interview that candidate if the offer is out to them.

287
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,800
It doesn't hurt for people to drop them at extract from a message up with an email and say, hey, we're excited about the potential of working with you.

288
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,700
Let me know how we can answer any questions?

289
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,900
It just makes it especially in the remote world where you're not meeting people face-to-face, and grab a coffee or grab a lunch with them.

290
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,200
We just had to be more intentional and leaning into those conversations.

291
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Those are some great practical tips and points.

292
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,600
Thank you.

293
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,900
Alexandria.

294
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,400
Lane has a question.

295
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,900
What is an example?

296
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:21,400
Of an intention besides collaboration when redesigning the in-office experience.

297
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,500
It's a great question, and I am pretty sure.

298
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:25,800
Jason.

299
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,900
You have some, some thoughts to what you're seeing in the market, especially around employee recognition.

300
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,900
I think I will answer this from The Experience side of a distributed Workforce.

301
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:44,100
And so, you know, besides collaboration and sort of like thinking how the office experience should be.

302
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:50,700
I think, I think, attention shows up a lot in the in-betweens that goes ignored in many ways.

303
00:28:51,400 --> 00:29:02,600
So for instance, you know, higher Employee, let us say you have a headquarters in New York and la and Austin but you're hiring someone that lives in Tennessee, and she is the only employee in Tennessee.

304
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,900
It's all the in-betweens of thinking about that employee as if that's the most important point.

305
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,700
We at your company.

306
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,800
And asking the question, what is her experience?

307
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,400
What is her experience from Tennessee?

308
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,800
She's not going to be anybody else for a long time until we hire some other people, maybe start pod and Tennessee.

309
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,200
What is her experience?

310
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:38,700
And going back to what Jason was saying, map and I have experienced, but bringing the attention down to even those and I go back to from what I am seeing in the market, you know, our customers, they're taking that little contention into every touchpoint from the employee onboarding.

311
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,300
How do we make that better than another Zoom call or performance, review, call or interview cop?

312
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:52,600
From the company Town Hall, which is the most important event at your company, that builds culture and drives the values of the company.

313
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,800
How do we do that better?

314
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:08,000
Then just another call, like the whole another call, that's the easy way out putting intention and to and fill in the gaps in something they want is for that person, especially that's not submitted to, the office goes, goes really, really far.

315
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,700
And that's just one example of what we're seeing, how our companies are taking that and little contention.

316
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:24,900
Nice, I might kind of share an idea around like if it sounds like the question is around, understanding how to create better collaboration in person and virtually in hybrid.

317
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:33,300
I think what we're trying to do is Design Systems that work in both environments and I will share a couple of examples of things that seem to work really well.

318
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,900
So, I think fundamentally there's this huge desire for human connection.

319
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,000
No surprises there.

320
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:45,000
And so what we're trying to be to Rob's point is we're trying to create all these, what we call them micro moments where people can connect ideally in a day.

321
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,900
Basis and have meaningful connection.

322
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:54,000
And so, one thing we have done that works well in person or remotely as we do a daily huddle, a daily scrum.

323
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,500
So everybody in the entire company to 10 minute long meeting, they get broken up into small groups, and these aren't the normal functional groups.

324
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,600
It's not like software developers of soft, develop software developers.

325
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:14,900
It's like, it can be like a customer success person, an Ops person, a software engineer their lumped together in small groups of sort of 7 to 10 people, and they talk about one personal goal and one work goal.

326
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,200
Every single day and it's really cool.

327
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,100
You hear about what matters in their life.

328
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,300
And like, for example, we have one software engineer, mark, an amazing guy.

329
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,000
He's done a, he's hit 100 over 100 days streak on Duolingo.

330
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,200
I know that he's learning Spanish, which is amazing.

331
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,500
Just the other day.

332
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:37,700
I learned one of our sdrs Guillermo wants to do his MBA and I as a CEO, I could potentially be in a good position to help them maybe with educational practice.

333
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,000
Maybe just some time off.

334
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:48,100
So creating these micro moments in a very deliberate matter is super powerful and the other thing is It's not it's obviously not just about me but about connecting the team.

335
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,600
And so yeah, every single day on video 10 minutes long, the whole team connects.

336
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:59,200
And then one other the way you wrap it up, everybody comes back together in one big room, and we are we asked a fun fact question.

337
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,700
So one person lost the question.

338
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,600
One person will answer it, and they're kind of playful silly questions.

339
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,600
But again, it creates humor creates his likeness in the day.

340
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:14,900
And yesterday's question, for example, was, if you're on a baseball team, what would be your entrance song and the fellowship?

341
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,200
Has meant so, so run.

342
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,900
I am sorry friend of but love it.

343
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,000
Like it's it connects people and yet to hear you get to see the human side of what people are all about.

344
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:36,400
So, I think these are micro moments can be, well, then important is to create repeatable scalable systems that you can stamp into your company, whether it's us or yourself and create fun environment.

345
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:44,000
So Jason, what was your wish your entry song to the baseball game, so I didn't answer it, but I will tell you Shawn.

346
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,500
He's like just because like here comes the bride.

347
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,900
So Sean's not married.

348
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,400
I don't know.

349
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,300
It was just a random answer ever and then there's the Rick Ashley song.

350
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,400
Somebody else answered.

351
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,200
Never going to give up.

352
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,300
So it was like, oh, that's fun.

353
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,200
Playful silliness.

354
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,300
That's fine.

355
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,200
That's great.

356
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,400
That's awesome.

357
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,900
Love this micro moment ideas.

358
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,800
That's great.

359
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:14,900
All right, we have time for one last question, and I am already cutting into some of the meditation time, but we have got some good up votes on this question.

360
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,800
From Abby.

361
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,900
So Rob.

362
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,400
Jason, if you can make a quick, that would be great.

363
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,600
How do you keep employees, engaged and connected in a fully remote Workforce?

364
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,500
What are some exciting ideas?

365
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,700
You have seen for remote employees.

366
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,500
I think you have covered some of them, but are there any others?

367
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,400
Yeah, I will cover 11.

368
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,100
That we do here.

369
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,500
Welcome.

370
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,000
We call it the welcome Cafe and it's a No Agenda.

371
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:47,100
It's picture yourself walking into the building and you're gonna go grab coffee at the Adding space and you bump into some employees.

372
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,700
And so, is an unstructured way.

373
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,200
It's a happens at noon, East Coast, which is 9 AM Pacific.

374
00:33:53,500 --> 00:34:09,000
And so, whether you're having your first cup of coffee, or just starting to eat your lunch, we encourage employees to drop by and have unstructured conversations and so on, welcome, we basically have some tunes that you land into in this Auditorium and then you go into some Lounge.

375
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,199
We call them now and we call them Lounge rooms.

376
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,400
You can go and grab a table, sit down and have a conversation and it's Interesting.

377
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:22,100
Because someone there's a few employees here at, welcome, learning, Spanish, kind of keeping the Duolingo thing going learning Spanish.

378
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,600
And they created a table within the welcome Cafe called, welcome espanyol.

379
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,000
And now, people are jumping in there, and they're practicing their Spanish.

380
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:44,900
And, so I think what we're seeing is structured and unstructured ways where you have the structured opportunities of company Town Hall employee experience, onboarding, all these ERT group communities really making those cow.

381
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:53,699
Whether you have these unstructured ways of just holding space, whether that's for a light conversation or a deeper conversation.

382
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,100
It's about just making space for those conversations.

383
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,500
That's awesome.

384
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,200
I love it.

385
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,500
And then again, really quickly.

386
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:10,500
That one thing I might add, is we to part, quick answer, we have weekly one-to-ones between all team leads, and all employees.

387
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,200
And one of the questions we asked is what's on your bucket list and I like, how can we support you in that journey?

388
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,300
And in summary if you can help an employee achieve, what matters most to them.

389
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,800
Like, that's how you break that traditional employee-employer barrier and you come alongside as I can.

390
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Partner in life.

391
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:35,000
And I tell you if you want to see people light up, you f*** find out what matters to them and you help them achieve it and it could be something incredibly Spa.

392
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,800
Maybe there are stray.

393
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,400
It could be something incredibly simple.

394
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Maybe they're single mom.

395
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Maybe they work in healthcare, given the day off, sending them to the spa, can be massively impactful, maybe something, bigger middle of traveling or wine, sending them to Napa Valley, can be, you know, really meaningful as well.

396
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,400
Whatever.

397
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,100
It is, find out what that thing is and help them achieve it and you're going to break that barrier.

398
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:04,200
You can become a mentor or a cheerleader in their life, and they're never going to forget you as a leader colleague or friend.

399
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,000
So good, got a snap.

400
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Amazing.

401
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,700
Wow.

402
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,500
Well, thank you so much Roberto Jason.

403
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:22,400
It is a pleasure to hear from each of your experiences and inspiring quite honestly to see how you are executing employee experiences within your org.

404
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,500
So, thank you so much, and we're going to actually transition now.

405
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,400
Into our marvelous experience.

406
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,500
So, let us all clear our minds, like, keep those insights.

407
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Keep those amazing golden nuggets that are applicable to you.

408
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,700
And now we're going to move into a session with Marda.

409
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,100
But before we jump into that, we want to take a quick poll.

410
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,400
So Jessica is my producer.

411
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,800
Thanks, Jess for putting that up on stage.

412
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,100
How are you feeling right now?

413
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,700
And all of you can just click one through ten.

414
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,900
One being the worst ten being absolutely marvelous.

415
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,500
How are you feeling?

416
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,500
All right.

417
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,100
Okay, we have got some, a lot of AIDS which is great some fives and fours.

418
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,300
Well, we're going to take this poll again at the end of this event.

419
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,900
So we hope to see some of that, adjust Marta, take it away for us.

420
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,300
Thanks, Gina.

421
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,500
And hello everyone.

422
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,300
My name is Marta Kagan.

423
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,800
I am the co-founder of marvelous.

424
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,400
And if you have never heard of marvelous, you're going to get to know us right now.

425
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,600
We are on a mission to help humans flourish through mental, emotional Fitness.

426
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,300
Now, what is mental, emotional Fitness?

427
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,800
Some of you may be familiar with that.

428
00:37:42,800 --> 00:38:02,500
You may already have your own practice, but if you're not the best way to think of it is the analogy of physical fitness, you know, you Physical fitness to get stronger to build stamina, endurance, resilience to be more flexible and to perform at our physical best.

429
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,200
We could do the same thing for our mental emotional, state for our inner world.

430
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:22,600
And if we can Master our inner world, if we can become more self-aware that are able to self-regulate that are able to bounce back from setbacks and failures, then we can show up and feel marvelous and be Arboles every day.

431
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:39,600
And so what we offer, our inner workouts, back to the fitness analogy, like the one you're going to experience today coaching support Community accountability, all kinds of ways to support you on your journey, to flourishing to showing up and being your best every single day.

432
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:48,600
The important thing I want to point out here is we have this philosophy at marvelous, that it doesn't matter what the Day brings to you, right?

433
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,500
It doesn't matter if you had a great onboarding experience.

434
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,100
Answer not.

435
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:58,200
I mean it does matter, no offense Jason and Rob but what really matters is what you bring to the day, right?

436
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:58,800
It matters.

437
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,000
How you respond to situations that may not be ideal.

438
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,500
It matters.

439
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,700
How you respond to feedback, you get that isn't desired.

440
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So we are about helping you bring your very best to the day, no matter what that day, May throw at you.

441
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,600
All right to begin.

442
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:21,400
I am going to take you today through one of my favorite mini mental, emotional workouts.

443
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,800
It's called the three, two one.

444
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,900
And it is something I do literally almost daily.

445
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,400
So I am going to take you through it.

446
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,200
I am going to teach you what, you can experience it and something that you can do not just right now.

447
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:42,500
But tomorrow, the next day, anytime you need, the equivalent of the control, alt delete button on your mental emotional state.

448
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,400
It's a beautiful way to reset relatively quickly.

449
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,100
You can even take pieces of it apart and use them as needed.

450
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,400
But we're going to do three, two, one, and what that involves.

451
00:39:51,700 --> 00:40:05,400
Is three rounds of breath work to moments of gratitude and one moment of power, and I am going to explain what each of those are before I start, I am just going to ask you this mental.

452
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,900
Emotional Fitness is not a spectator sport just like you wouldn't go to the gym and watch people, you know workout and go.

453
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,000
Yeah, I am good.

454
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,800
I feel fit.

455
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,700
You gotta do the work.

456
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,400
The same is true for mental, emotional Fitness.

457
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,100
So please join me.

458
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,400
Do this stuff with me.

459
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,300
Going to count you out.

460
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:28,500
I am going to coach him and explain everything but Let us make this a participation not observation moment.

461
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,800
All right, the three, two one.

462
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,500
We're going to begin with three rounds of breath work.

463
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,100
Now, why breathwork we take roughly 22,000?

464
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,700
Breaths a day, something along those lines and most of them, we don't pay attention to.

465
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,200
We take it for granted.

466
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,200
They just happen if we can tune into just a few, just a few minutes of our breathing.

467
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,400
It's an opportunity for us to shut off.

468
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:11,700
Autopilot the program that's running in our head to step away from worries, thoughts, judgments to-do, lists to tune, into our bodies, to tune into how we feel internally and to tune into just the present moment.

469
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,300
It gives us that control-alt-delete starting point.

470
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:20,000
So we're going to do some intentional breathing and to get started.

471
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,400
I want you to put your hands on your belly.

472
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,500
First of all, make sure you're seated.

473
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,800
It sometimes when people do breath work for the first time, or they do, you know, type, they haven't done before.

474
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,500
You can get a little bit lightheaded.

475
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,100
And, so I want to make sure you're safe and seated.

476
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,200
So, take a seat.

477
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:42,500
If you're not sitting in the, put your hands on your belly and then go ahead and take a big deep breath in at your own pace.

478
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,100
And notice what happens with your hand?

479
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:54,000
See if you can feel your belly, Rising, as you inhale and then falling as you exhale, or does your belly sort of stay still and most of that breathing happen up here.

480
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,100
Now, if you're a belly breather, good, that's what I want you to do.

481
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:04,900
If you're not, if you took a deep inhale, and then on the exhale, you didn't feel anything happen.

482
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,100
You're probably breathing, more up in your chest.

483
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,800
And that's okay.

484
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,000
A lot of us do that.

485
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:17,900
We're going to try to focus on belly breathing because that's going to give us a chance to really use our diaphragm to fully engage our full lung capacity.

486
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,400
Get more oxygenation.

487
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,500
We're going to feel it more.

488
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,400
We're going to enjoy it more.

489
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,600
It's going to benefit us more.

490
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,500
You're going to put your hands on your belly.

491
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:31,000
And we're going to start off with simple inhales and exhales for about 30 seconds.

492
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,100
So simple inhales and exhales.

493
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,000
I am going to count you out.

494
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,300
We're going to inhale, exhale, inhale.

495
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,900
Exhale, keep your hands on your belly as accuse.

496
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,400
You can kind of notice on the inhale belly goes out.

497
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,600
Exhale it goes in.

498
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,400
This is going to be relatively not too fast, not too slow.

499
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,200
But again, if you start to feel light-headed or uncomfortable, you can stop at any point in this process from there.

500
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,700
We're going to switch to a couple other movements, and we're to do three cycles.

501
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,800
So you're gonna have a Q on the screen, and I am going to talk you through it.

502
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,200
All you need to do is listen and breathe.

503
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,700
Are you ready?

504
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,700
All right, hands on the belly and begin again with just one.

505
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,700
Nice deep inhale through the nose.

506
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,200
And exhale through the mouth.

507
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,800
And here we go.

508
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:33,000
Inhale one, exhale, one, inhale to Exhale to inhale, three, exhale, three, inhale four exhale for inhale.

509
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,800
Five.

510
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,700
Exhale, five.

511
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,500
Inhale 6, exhale 6.

512
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:41,500
Seven.

513
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,300
Inhale 8.

514
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,700
Exhale, inhale nine.

Exhale, inhale, 10, exhale, inhale 11 exhale, inhale 12.

00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,400

00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,400
Don't forget the belly, exhale, 15.

522
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,700
24, getting close to the end.

523
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,400
Still, through the nose, 25.

524
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,500
Exhale, belly goes in.

525
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,500
Inhale belly gets big.

Exhale 29, exhale and 30.

530
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,000
And don't exhale, just yet.

531
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,600
Exhale.

532
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,200
Now and keep those lungs empty.

533

We're going to fir count of 30.

534
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,000
Just holding the lungs, empty.

535
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,800
We're at about five now.

536
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,900
Just holding them.

537
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,500
Empty just in the present moment.

538
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,900
Lips are closed hands resting on your belly.

539
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,400
12.

540
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,600
If you can't hold it, the First full 30 seconds, that's okay.

541
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,400
Try and take little sips of are as you need to.

542
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,300
If you can't try and just hold the lungs empty.

543
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,000
Just keep them empty.

You just took in circulate through your body and 321, exhale! Beautiful.

548
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:09,600
Now, inhale for a count of five through the nose, so, And then hold that breath for 10.

549
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,900
We're holding the lungs full the belly.

550
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,700
Full for another four.

551
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,100
Three, two, one.

552
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,600

42 and exhale for a count of 5 3.

558
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,300
Two.

559
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,900
One, beautiful and just close your eyes.

560
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,500
For a moment.

561
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,700
We're going to repeat that round for a moment.

562
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,900
Just feel what you feel.

563
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:12,800
Let your body settle, let your breath go back to its natural state and take this moment just to observe whatever sensation may be there.

564
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,900
Maybe you feel some tingling in your fingers or your face.

565
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,800
Maybe feel a little Renewed Energy.

566
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,500
And whatever it is that you're noticing.

567
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,600
Go ahead and open your eyes, and we're going to go through that same sequence, one more time.

568
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,500
So sitting up comfortably in your seat, hands are on your belly.

569
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,300
And we're going to do that.

570
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,000
30 inhales and exhales ready.

571
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,100
Inhale and exhale.

572
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,900
Two and exhale.

573
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,900
Inhale three bellies gets big, exhale, inhale for exhale, inhale.

574
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,600
Five.

575
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:16,800
Exhale belly gets big on each, inhale and then it gets flatter on the exhale, seven on the inhale and exhale 8.

576
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,600
Exhale nine.

577
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,600
Exhale, we're doing this through the nose and out through the nose.

578
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:35,100
Exhale, 11, exhale, 12, inhale, using the diaphragm 13 on the inhale.

579
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,100
Exhale.

580
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,000
14 and exhale.

581
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,500
15, exhale.

582
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:49,800
16 exhale try and make it as full as you can on each count.

583
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,000
It's short.

584
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,600
But you're trying to get maximum are maximum use.

585
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,800
We're on 18 now.

586
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,200
Exhale, 19.

587
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:09,100
Exhale 2010 more to go inhale using that diaphragm, exhale.

588
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,700
21.

589
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,300
Exhale 22, you're doing great.

590
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:21,800
Keep it up 23! Exhale 24.

591
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,800
Just focusing on the breath.

592
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:28,000
The belly 25, just kidding.

593
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,800
26.

594
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:41,200
No, laughing just breathing 27 and exhale, 28, exhale, 29, exhale.

595
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,400
And 30, exhale, beautiful.

596
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,700
Now, inhale once more for me and exhale, then hold the lungs, empty for count of 30.

597
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,500
Here we go.

598
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,100
Just holding the breath nose closed.

599
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,800
We have got about 25, 20 seconds to go.

600
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,200
Try and hold it in the whole time.

601
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,200
They're guessed.

602
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,200
Hold it out, because we exhaled not letting air in.

603
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,200
In just sitting with it.

604
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,800
Just feeling what you feel about, 10 more seconds to go.

605
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:28,500
You're almost there and five, four, three, two, and one.

606
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:37,600
Take a nice big, inhale to a count of 5 3 2 1 and then hold the lungs full for 10.

607
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,200
Eight.

608
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,300
Six.

609
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:50,400
42 and exhale for a count of five.

610
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,800
Three, One release.

611
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,500
One more time.

612
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,400
Inhale for a count of five.

613
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:20,500
And one and at the top holds the are in for a count of 10, you're doing great almost done here, 3 2 1, and then exhale for a count of five 31, beautiful.

614
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,800
I am just take whatever kind of breath feels good.

615
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,800
Now, at the end of this, I sometimes like to just take a big inhale and just sigh it out, right?

616
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,700
Just letting everything go and then, close your eyes with me for a moment.

617
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:43,900
And again, settle into sensation, settle into, whatever you're noticing in your body.

618
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:49,100
I often get tingling in my fingertips or get a little heated around my chest.

619
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,000
Take a moment just to observe.

620
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,000
To let your breathing go back to whatever its natural state is.

621
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:08,100
Feel what you feel without judgment without wondering if you did it right or wrong without thinking you could have done, it better.

622
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,100
Just noticing.

623
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,500
What is total radical acceptance of the year now?

624
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:28,900
And then in this sort of blissful post conscious mindful breathing moment.

625
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:35,500
I want to slip right into our two moments of gratitude and it's up to you can keep your eyes closed if you'd like or you can keep them open.

626
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:43,200
And what I want you to do is I want you to put one hand on your chest and one in back on your belly.

627
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:52,900
A nice can be closed if you wish and in this Blissful present State, this refreshed oxygenated plays we are together.

628
00:52:53,100 --> 00:53:03,700
I want you to take a moment to say thank you to express some gratitude to appreciate someone or something in your life.

629
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,400
Don't overthink it.

630
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,900
It might be the person that gave you the parking spot today.

631
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,700
You might be grateful for the weather.

632
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:30,000
You might be grateful for yourself that you showed up here to do this.

633
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,500
Whatever it is big or small.

634
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,700
Take a moment to recognize.

635
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:48,800
Two things people or situations for which you feel gratitude, and feel that gratitude as you acknowledge that.

636
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,200
Thank you for this beautiful day.

637
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Thank you for the air in my lungs.

638
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,400
Thank you.

639
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:08,000
For this moment, whatever it is, you can say it out loud, or you can say it in your head but say it and feel it.

640
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,800
And when you're ready, if your eyes are closed, you can go ahead and open them.

641
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:31,400
And if you have pen and paper, handy, go ahead and write down the two people or things for which you just express your gratitude.

642
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,000
Take a moment and write down what it is.

643
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,100
You're grateful for.

644
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,400
Why you are grateful?

645
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:50,400
And after we're done here today, you might even think about telling that person that you're thankful or taking a moment to express your gratitude in a more.

646
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:56,600
Public or direct kind of way optional bonus points.

647
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:04,100
And the final thing we're going to do is of the three, two, one R1 is Our Moment of power.

648
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,100
So a lot of us starter days off with the to-do list, right?

649
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,700
How, what do we got to do today?

650
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:16,100
I want to shift that and I want to focus on how we want to be how we want to feel.

651
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,800
I personally want to be in feel marvelous.

652
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,500
You may want to be or feel something different.

653
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,000
You might want to feel motivated.

654
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,600
You might want to feel peaceful.

655
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,200
You might want to feel capable focused, patient.

656
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,000
Whatever it is.

657
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:44,600
There's a beautiful truth Around The Power of Words and language and our ability to express how we feel and how we wish to feel or be, we don't spend enough time on that the average person.

658
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,600
If you ask them, how they are fine, right?

659
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,600
Or best case scenario of sad, happy angry.

660
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,400
That's it.

661
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,300
We can do better than that.

662
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,600
We can choose.

663
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:02,400
Not only how we want to feel and how we want to be, but we can choose the language that empowers us to actually embody that desired state.

664
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,800
So that's what this is about.

665
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,300
So I want you to take a moment.

666
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:10,100
Again, eyes closed or open and decide how you want.

667
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:16,600
It to feel for the rest of the state, how you want to feel At this moment and going forward for this day.

668
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,800
If you have pen and paper handy, go ahead and write that down.

669
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,100
You can also frame.

670
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,100
It could be either part 2 or different way to frame it.

671
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,100
Who do you want to be?

672
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,700
How do you want to show up?

673
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:41,200
And then between those two answers and might be the same answer, might be two different words.

674
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:49,300
I want you to choose the most specific encouraging, like the most magnetic word.

675
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,900
You can think of to describe that thinking power words, right?

676
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:57,300
So if you're if you want to feel sad today, which I hope no one's rain down.

677
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,100
You want to feel sad.

678
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,000
I don't want you to say, I want to feel sad today.

679
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,100
I want to feel devastated.

680
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,400
I want few props are known why it takes that.

681
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,700
Sorry, if you want to feel Today, I want to feel vibrant.

682
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,700

00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,000
I want to feel euphoric, right?

684
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,200
Pick the best word.

685
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:25,700
You can think of and write that down and say it to yourself because that's going to be your keyword, your Mantra, your like pavlovian symbol.

686
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:35,600
When you catch yourself out of that state, when you catch yourself feeling mat, if your desired state is, euphoric, you're going to do some of what we just did.

687
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,600
You're going to do a little a bit of breathing going to remind yourself of that word.

688
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,800
You're going to choose how you want to show up.

689
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,300
It's not what the Day brings that you bring to the day.

690
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:45,700
Okay.

691
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,000
So write down your power word, choose that word.

692
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,300
Burn it into your brain.

693
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,100
Keep it on your paper and your back pocket.

694
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:55,900
If you need to.

695
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:04,200
And the last thing we're going to do together is we're going close this three, two, one three rounds of breath work, few moments of gratitude.

696
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:08,900

And say these words out loud with me.

702

Again, the power of language and intention the emotion we put behind our words, really changes our brains operating system and allows us to become the things we say.

So, just, you know, talking about burnout.

11
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,500
I was doing a little bit of research and the American Psychological Association survey.

12
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:48,900
There was one that was taken recently and a massive 79 percent of us workers, reported having a severe sense of work-related stress.

13
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,500
30% of those said they were struggling with emotional exhaustion.

14
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,300
Will fatigue lack of motivation at work and cognitive weariness.

15
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:11,900
So I am so excited about the panelists that we have today as they are the experts on the front lines, not only managing burn out for themselves, but also for their teammates at a company level, so we're going to hear from them.

16
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,200
But before we jump into that, a couple things to note.

17
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,000
Housekeeping wise, we have got to help tab.

18
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,000

Captioning knob underneath the screen so you can flip those on or adjust the volume as you need to.

21
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,200
Alright, so we're going to start with a poll.

22
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,500
Jessica, my producer in the green room.

23
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,100
Could you put that pull up?

24
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,700
How burnt out?

25
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,800
Are you feeling?

26
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
And y'all can keep it real on a scale of one to ten.

27
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,100
This.

28
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,700
This is for you yourself.

29
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,000
We're not talking about teams.

30
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,500
We're not talking about company level.

31
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
We're just talking about you.

32
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,400
All right, this is real.

33
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,200
Wow, we have got some tens.

34
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,600
So it's some sevens.

35
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,400
Okay?

36
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,500
All right.

37
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,800
This is very real and I think all of us are feeling and experiencing this at this time.

38
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,100
So with that I would love to invite to the stage our panelists today.

41
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:22,900
Hello.

42
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,500
Oh, hey Xena.

43
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,400
Hey.

44
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,000
Hello.

45
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,400
How are you?

46
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
All doing?

47
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,300
Hi everyone.

48
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,900
Hey folks, doing good?

49
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,600
Ready for this.

50
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,100
Good.

51
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,400
Good.

52
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,000
Good.

53
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,900
Yeah.

54
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,600
I am so excited to hear from each of you.

55
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,900
You know, we actually received up to 40 questions that were submitted in advance.

56
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,800
And so there's a lot of folks that are curious and have some questions around this.

57
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,600
Topic.

58
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:02,500
We went through all of those questions and identify the top 10 most burning questions, which we have under the Q&A tab right now.

59
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,600
So all attendees of this event, feel free to jump into that Q&A and upvote.

60
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,100
The question that is most burning to you.

61
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,400
In the meantime.

62
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,200
What we have done is broken down.

63
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,400
The questions under three categories.

64
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,900
One is managing burn out for yourself to is managing it for your team.

65
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,100
At that level and then three managing it at a company level.

66
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,600
And so, I wanted to get really real with each of you all as we tackle.

67
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:43,500
The first category of burnout for yourselves, you know, each of you are leading teams leading companies, and how are you all doing for real?

68
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,900
And how are you managing burn out for yourselves?

69
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,500
We're going to take it their guys.

70
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,500
I love that question Jenna and there's a friend of mine.

71
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:57,800
Actually.

72
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,300
He always asks, how are you really?

73
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,800
Really?

74
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,800
Because I think it's really easy to say I am fine and honestly the last two weeks.

75
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,200
I have not been fine.

76
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,000
It's been hard.

77
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,100
It's been really hard to kind of handle what's going on in the world and what was going on at home and then also still perform in the way that I want to put my job.

78
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,500
So definitely feeling it.

79
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,700
Belong wise.

80
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,200
I think there's a lot of different things.

81
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,700
I am doing.

82
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:31,600
Personally, therapies one of them and just kind of like learning and educating myself on kind of the things to do to take care of ourselves.

83
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I think, we sometimes know what those are in the back of our minds, but to actually be intentional about taking that time to do those things and seeing that the impact even a short period of time with it and how that helps, but then I will fall off the wagon, so to speak and not do it in the next week or so.

84
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,500
And I will be back in the same spot.

85
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,200
But yeah, constantly try to remind myself to do those things like working out reading watching shows.

86
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,400
I love that kind of thing.

87
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,600
Yeah, I think Vicki makes a really good point event.

88
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:12,200
However, was doing a few months ago has completely changed from how I am doing now, which has probably completely changed from last week.

89
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,500
So I think it's definitely not working at a start-up.

90
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,600
There's always so much to do there.

91
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,000
Always, especially when you're a manager, people manager.

92
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,600
You want to, you have so many things to think about in my developing, my team enough and I caught up on my projects at my am I giving it my best?

93
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:38,300
And I think sometimes that imposter syndrome starts to creep in which starts to lead to burnout because you feel like your list keeps getting longer and longer.

94
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:49,600
So I definitely have to remind myself to constantly check in with myself, and I am really big on reflecting on previous month's and kind of saying what went well what didn't what should I be doing more?

95
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:55,300
Of and sometimes it's I should be doing a lot more of self-care and I should be doing a lot more of what we call it.

96
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:06,000
Where ax is declaring meeting bankruptcy, which is reorganizing my calendar and getting rid of meetings that are not serving purpose and scheduling things like a walk with my dog.

97
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,300
I literally check weather.com every Monday.

98
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:18,600
And I look at the week and I figure out when I can get outside with my dog for a half hour just to decompress and you know, take a little reset between meetings.

99
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,100
So good.

100
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,800
That's good.

101
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,900
That's good.

102
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,500
Brittany.

103
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,900
I am just going to follow up on what you said.

104
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,300
They're around getting outside.

105
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,800
Well, first of all, I think you know, when Gina was putting together this panel and still response.

106
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,200
We got was fantastic.

107
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:42,900
So I am happy that everyone is here to learn and sort of learn from each other and share best practices and tips.

108
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,900
But really, you know, us as M A lot of times we feel burnt out, and we're trying to help burnt.

109
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,700
Employees.

110
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,900
All right, if we're honest and I think asking the question with the leader.

111
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:01,000
First, I think is really powerful question because we get to set the pace.

112
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,300
We get to set the president's, we get this like the example with our team's, right?

113
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:16,400
And so once a couple of small things that I do, I try to get outside every day, and I have been doing walking talks for 10 ones, and I encourage folks that I am speaking with it.

114
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,200
We don't really have to look at the screen.

115
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:18,900
Call me.

116
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,900
On my cell phone, and we're going to go for a walk and what I found doing this over the last couple months has been a game-changer for me because one you get good vitamin D.

117
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:38,700
But to I think it also the psyche changes in how you communicate with that person as well wherever from one Zoom meeting to another Zoo meeting.

118
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,400
Just pick up the phone and putting some are pods and going for a walk.

119
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,900
I don't know it just it makes a big difference and so overall though Gino when you ask that question, how are we?

120
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Burnout, I went back to thinking about my wife because I feel like it's like this family affair like to beat burnout.

121
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,000
It's like it's not just work.

122
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:07,000
It's like this holistic perspective that we have to take, and so we put boundaries up around it.

123
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,000
And now as a CEO that your phone is almost all like 24/7.

124
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,900
And so we had to, as a family, put the boundaries in place and say, you know what this time is for.

125
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,300
Family, so, I block out the time on my calendar.

126
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,800
That's like the golden hours, and I say, do not book.

127
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,000
And I, the block is actually in yellow and it is a reminder for me.

128
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Like these are the golden hours of the day.

129
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:41,600
When I get to spend with my two year old and my wife and is when we do dinner and when I, whenever I have to miss those idea tends to not be a good signal, right?

130
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,900
It tends to be too.

131
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're pushing things out.

132
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
They really, really matter that you said really matter.

133
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:55,200
And, that's That typically triggers me, go back and re-evaluate my time and my calendar and all these different things.

134
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,000
And so anyway, yeah burn.

135
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,100
I was real, I am here for to talk about it.

136
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,700
That's great.

137
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,000
Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing.

138
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,000
From each of you.

139
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
It's very insightful to hear.

140
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,700
What are the signs and triggers a burnout?

141
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,500
Are there signs that we could be looking at way before each of us are even feeling it?

142
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,400
I will kick off here if that's okay.

143
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,100
I, you know, getting ready for this conversation.

144
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:35,000
I just went online and just, you know what, how do people Define burnout like let us start with that.

145
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Like what is the definition of burnout?

146
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,400
And I think there's obvious.

147
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,200
There're two definitions.

148
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,700
Actually.

149
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,200
There's one that as people leaders there's definition in the space of HR and Leadership and foot with the posture of employees.

150
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,300
And then there's the Out from Webster's perspective, right?

151
00:14:53,300 --> 00:15:03,700
And so, on our side burnout is a state of emotional, physical and mental exhaustion, caused by excessive and prolonged stress.

152
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,700
That's where real we can all head.

153
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,200
Not to that.

154
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,700
Is that yep?

155
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:08,900
Yep.

156
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,100
Yep.

157
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,300
Yep.

158
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,500
Yep.

159
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:15,100
Yep, and then my mind went to okay with the what does Webster say?

160
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:29,600
And it's really interesting to correlation here is basically the reduction of fuel is being on empty, is a motor that has nothing else to give is your cup is fully empty and you don't have the fuel to operate.

161
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:38,400
It's another term is, you know, a mechanical device that failed it, overheated.

162
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,200
It's done the poop and it's like you.

163
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Look at those two terms that you have overlap them and a lot of them.

164
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,600
I mean, are super relevant to how people describe the feeling of burnout.

165
00:15:49,800 --> 00:16:08,500
And I think that when you're asking about the signs and triggers, you know, I went on to even do research in this area as well, because I want to be equipped for, and we're here, talking about it and I will just read out a couple of the things that people more professional than I am at this space at Keep their lives to this and helping people manage these things.

166
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,800
What they say are.

167
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Some of the signs that lead to burnout.

168
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
One is every day feels like a bad day.

169
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,600
When the day just feels like a bad day and it happens more often than you.

170
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Like when you start caring about things less things at work, things at home.

171
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,800
You think about is a waste of energy, doing X, Y, or Z.

172
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,000
When you feel exhausted all the time.

173
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:46,600
The time even if you had a good night's sleep and you still exhausted and the majority of your time is spent on tasks that feel overwhelming.

174
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,300
These are like some of those top signs that folks, relate to burnout.

175
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:58,200
And, so I think that pointing back to the question you were asking about signs and such.

176
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,500
I think we can all relate to those things.

177
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,800
Quite significantly in our, in our rows.

178
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,200
And so anyways, I felt like it was good to Anchor.

179
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,500
The conversation is Going with like what's the definition of it?

180
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Because I think it helps at framing there.

181
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:23,099
Yeah, I think it really if you think about the signs and triggers it varies so much person to person and I think, burnout and stress.

182
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,500
It's so unique to each individual.

183
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
That as a manager.

184
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,800
I would say first at with your own self.

185
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,100
You need to really know yourself and check in with yourself.

186
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:41,000
But as a manager, you need to really know your people and pay attention to them and observe how your team works.

187
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And I think what I have noticed with my Small team is.

188
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:58,600
I understand what their normal behaviors are, and I understand when things are starting to fall off a little bit and I had something happen on my team recently, where someone who never is probably the most detail-oriented person.

189
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:07,700
So strong with ownership, just was starting to slip on some details and I wondered if she happy and I asked her flat out.

190
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,400
Are you happy here?

191
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,800
And I just wanted to check in and ask how things were going and just kind of hearing her out.

192
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:22,200
I realized she's Has not taken a vacation day and four months and it was my fault for not recognizing that she has not really taken any time off.

193
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,500
And we have been doing so much work lately.

194
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,800
That I mean, we have were balancing a lot right now.

195
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,600
So I pushed her to in the next month.

196
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:47,800
I want to see you taking time off on the calendar, and she took five days off, and she spread it out over two weeks, but took five days off, went to Coachella had a great time, came back fully recharged, and I mean, It's like seeing a completely different person.

197
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:54,200
So I think by knowing that and being able to recognize that something was off and by asking them comfortable questions.

198
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,000
Are you happy here?

199
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,200
Because no manager wants to hear.

200
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,500
No.

201
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,400
I am not happy.

202
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
It led us to this point of realizing.

203
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,300
Okay.

204
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,700
You need to take some time off.

205
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,000
Let me you know, let me pick up the slack and make sure you're taking care of yourself.

206
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,000
I think the only thing I would add to that is just doubling down on that recognizing signals.

207
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,100
I think for yourself and in your team and straight out, also asking.

208
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,900
And I think it's a good exercise for yourself and your team to write down, like, what are, what are the responses?

209
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,000
You have to stress?

210
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,700
What does that look like?

211
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,900
Because I don't think we sit down and really think about it until it's almost too late.

212
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:43,400
When in fact, if you had kind of paid attention to it earlier, you could see those little things kind of happening over because it is repeated that kind of Some sort of stress, that kind of goes over and over again to can cause burnout.

213
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,500
So definitely, definitely ask and don't be afraid to ask the question.

214
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,900
I think there's actually a very tangible walk away with Vicki.

215
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:00,400
What you just said, as you're managing your, your remote teams, you could actually ask them and document.

216
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,200
These things about your team members and even for yourself.

217
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,300
It's, I noticed there were some journaling comments in the chat.

218
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,500
I think knowing yourself.

219
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:08,900
Okay.

220
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,000
These are the triggers.

221
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,200
These are the things that make me stressed out.

222
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,700
It actually does the act of writing it down.

223
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Typing it out.

224
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,700
Can, it can really help.

225
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,600
Great inputs.

226
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,100
Now, there was a question that came up.

227
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,700
How do we differentiate burnout from stress, or a mental health issue?

228
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,000
Any takers on that one.

229
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,500
I will take a stab at this one because I think this is something.

230
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:45,900
I have thought a lot about when I saw this question come in because I think it's tough because it's not like their three different line items.

231
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,800
There's a lot of, I mean, there's a lot of similarities.

232
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,800
They think stress is something as I said before, all individuals deal with, it's really unique to themselves.

233
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,500
The triggers are different from one person to another.

234
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,100
And I think it's a lot about, you know, overall perception of pressure.

235
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:09,400
But it's connected to burnout because it really depends on how you manage your stress and how you let it affect you.

236
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,800
How you, you know, how much you are handling it, and how you're handling it.

237
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:20,500
And then I think, at the end of the day, burnout can eventually lead to mental health.

238
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:43,800
I think this is where, if you're not managing that stress, if you're not setting boundaries similar to what, you know, I think just talking about calendar blocks before Like if you are not setting those boundaries for family time for gym time, you are taking on too much and it gets to the point where you really need to like take a step back and think about how can I Implement?

239
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,700
Some really strong self care practices and figure out what works for you.

240
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,900
I mean, I am someone who sometimes I will let things build up, build up.

241
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,500
And then I am like, okay, you know, I need to come working super late one night.

242
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,500
I need to sleep in a little bit longer tomorrow.

243
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,500
I need to make carve out time for the gym that day.

244
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:13,600
But it's, you know, strut if what leads to poor mental health is when you're really not able to recognize those limits and take a step back, and I think we have all been there before.

245
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:21,800
And I have personally been there before where I have needed to take that step back and whether it's take a mental health day or, you know, share with my team.

246
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,200
I need to reprioritize this because I just don't have time for it right now.

247
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,100
And so, I think it's all really connected.

248
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,600
Yeah, I am not sure you could tease it apart and then there're differences in mental health to write.

249
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,000
Is this a temporary thing?

250
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,900
Is, it's a chronic issue is a developing into a chronic issue.

251
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,500
So definitely a pieces of the same puzzle.

252
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,900
I think a lot of stress can lead to burnout.

253
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,700
I think mental health is that whole Spectrum?

254
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,400
Really of like, you are you taking care of it?

255
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,900
Is it to the point where it's chronic and maybe someone needs medication.

256
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,100
And how do we do stigmatize?

257
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,800
Some of that?

258
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,300
I love what you said about like he calling out when you need that time.

259
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,100
I have had people telling me.

260
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:15,800
Hey, can we move this meeting with my brains not here today, or I have had too many and I just can't and I won't be at my full capacity and doing it more like yeah, let us do that and making sure we're having kind of opening the space to have those kinds of conversations.

261
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,100
Say today is not a good headspace day.

262
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:19,900
Hmm.

263
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:32,000
I think the key right there to is how you as a manager, you're opening that up, like you're saying, it's okay to admit that, you know, giving the permission you also addressed the boundaries.

264
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,300
That's a question that came in.

265
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,300
How do I manage work versus personal boundaries?

266
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,600
Everything collides together in this remote, remote working world.

267
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,100
So how are you all managing that for yourselves?

268
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,800
And then how do you do it for your teams?

269
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,900
Will go right into that.

270
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,700
Teams.

271
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,100
Yeah, I will kick off a little bit on my side again.

272
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,600
Like, when I started I said I have this chunk of time.

273
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,700
Every single day for family, five days a week.

274
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,600
It doesn't move on Wednesdays.

275
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:19,100
I try to have no meetings, Wednesdays, obviously, sometimes that doesn't work and what we're having some teams experiment is at the team level is they get to select a no meeting day like within their teams, right?

276
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,900
So like in product, it might be Thursday, might be won.

277
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,500
For engineering and it's less about like being on 24/7 back-to-back.

278
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,800
One meeting to meetings to be meetings for meetings.

279
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:37,300
And then for me again going back to the 10 one's having those be walking talks have been phenomenal.

280
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,100
For me personally.

281
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,300
Now, I think going back to Brittany what you mentioned around?

282
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,600
The clear calendar bankruptcy.

283
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,400
I love that.

284
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,900
In fact, when we kicked off this court, I remember telling my staff.

285
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,200
Is a reevaluate.

286
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:04,900
All your meetings is quarter, like take a pause and kind of look at the calendar because the calendar ends up defining, everything we do whether we like it or not like that.

287
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,700
Invite is send.

288
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,300
There's people waiting for you on the other side of that Zoom link.

289
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,700
And if you're not taking inventory of whether this needs to be an actual call, can this be a phone call?

290
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,700
Can this just be an email or slack message?

291
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,400
Then?

292
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:26,300
Basically your lack of intentionality of checking in and In your time actually is going to pull you into a direction that you don't want to be in.

293
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:32,700
And so one things, I encourage my staff was to just re-evaluate that and I think what it does to.

294
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:41,200
It actually helps you not just create space for you and your team but it also helps you prioritize meetings actually matter.

295
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:50,900
If you take inventory of all your meetings, if you don't take inventory of your meetings, whether that's weekly monthly quarterly, then there's price and recurring meetings on there that don't need to be there.

296
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,500
And, so I go back to the calendar as this how I function every single day.

297
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:06,200
So the only way that I can operate is by making sure my calendar, reflects what I want, not necessarily what other people want as well.

298
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,600
That's great.

299
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,100
Roberto.

300
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,100
Any other thoughts?

301
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,900
Brittany make me, I was going to say, Roberto.

302
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,900
I feel like our calendars.

303
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:26,200
Probably look identical, because I do the same thing with icalendar blocks for family, time at night and blocks.

304
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,900
In the morning.

305
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,000
I think that overall, if anyone's booking over them, it's myself.

306
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,900
So I think having a visible calendar, we have transparent, calendars, attracts, people aren't going to go over those blocks.

307
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,300
When they see, you're taking Time for yourself.

308
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:53,000
I think the one thing that I would probably add is just in terms of, like, kind of the personal burnout when I have meetings back-to-back all day long, by the time I am signing off at night.

309
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,100
The last thing I want to do is talk to my husband or my family.

310
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:05,900
I am like, I have been talking all day long and it affects, you know, it if it's like, I want to end the day and spend that time with, you know, catching up on how your day was.

311
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:13,300
But sometimes when I realize I have so many at meetings, a it doesn't lead to a productive end of the day meeting.

312
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,200
So those last two meetings are really getting about 50% of me.

313
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:24,900
And then by the time I am signing off, it's really just not, I am not getting that personal time because I am so overwhelmed and thinking about, okay.

314
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,800
I had 10 meetings.

315
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,000
What do I need to action for each of those meetings?

316
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,600
And then I am probably working late into the night.

317
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:38,600
So I really try to manage my calendar and reorganize it as much as possible, which I would normally tell, you know, any new managers on my team.

318
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,800
I am like, Be consistent with your meetings, but you have to wear it.

319
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,800
We're working in such a different world now, so you have to reorganize things.

320
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Solid morning, ruthless need to prioritize, which we don't always do when I know I am people offices, especially hard because we're like, the empathy is so high and really all we want to get this done for people.

321
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,800
But you gotta sit down and say, no, this is where that line is.

322
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,400
Because if I am not gonna get my best, I won't be able to give you what you need.

323
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:03,900
Either.

324
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,200
The other thing.

325
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,100
I did want to call it.

326
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:13,100
Someone mentions the chat to is, if there isn't, you know, some people don't feel empowered to be able to have those conversations with their managers and that's true.

327
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:22,500
And I wish there was a really good solution for that if it doesn't come from the top down, And we as managers and leaders aren't displaying that, then it won't work.

328
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,100
And I mean it won't so that it won't work, but it won't be as effective.

329
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,300
Right?

330
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,100
I think as an individual, you can still try to do what you can.

331
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,800
But it definitely helps me have a support system and your team.

332
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,200
It's powerful.

333
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,900
I think I am seeing a lot of people resonating.

334
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,000
This is so real.

335
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:46,100
I have three children and you know II totally aligned to what you said, Brittany, right?

336
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,100
The other day after your, on all these calls.

337
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:55,100
It's like, I don't feel like talking, you know, so being able to prioritize scheduling.

338
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:00,300
I mean, how often do each of you manage your prioritization of your calendars?

339
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Day by day week by week.

340
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:11,600
It's unfortunately, I, so I try to do Sunday night check in and look at my week ahead.

341
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,700
That's when I typically check for.

342
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,000
And then every night, I check with the next day.

343
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,500
He's looking like, so then I can move things around if I need to.

344
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,300
But sometimes like today, I just move the meeting, just because I needed more space.

345
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,000
And I said, I see another slot on your calendar.

346
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,300
This time.

347
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,000
Does that work?

348
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,600
Okay, cool.

349
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,900
Well, I'ma go take a breather right now, or I am gonna go.

350
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,700
Have lunch with my kid as downstairs because I need that for me.

351
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,500
I do know, one thing as a new parent to.

352
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,300
I have one little girl.

353
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:50,900
She's two and a half going on 22 and I talk about this all the time like parenting and also being in a start-up is hard.

354
00:29:51,200 --> 00:30:01,900
But also for me, what it does is it forces me to unplug if you really are serious about that, if you say family time is family time, that time becomes rest.

355
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,500
But for me personally and it injects a different amount of energy, right?

356
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:18,900
Having a young kid that you can like nurture and play with and it's just a different world where I am going from like having an investor meeting to go in and clean blocks with your Barbies or whatever, whatever.

357
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,800
She's into that day.

358
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,200
PAW Patrol happens to be the thing.

359
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,000
She's into now.

360
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,100
So it's like this nice mix of things.

361
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,500
And, so I leaned into that really have the weight.

362
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:37,700
I lean into those moments and say, you know what, like yes, I have 30 I am gonna go grab that, and I am gonna go walk with the dog, or take a phone call instead.

363
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,000
And so, I do Sunday night for the week and then daily at night for the next day.

364
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,400
That's how I look at the calendars.

365
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,100
That's great.

366
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,900
Well, we got some questions that are going up voted.

367
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,000
So I am going to jump into this.

368
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I know we were in the category of management of burnout with your teams.

369
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,500
So, a couple questions related to that.

370
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,700
What are the burnout signs and triggers with team members that I should be aware of?

371
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,900
And I think we might have addressed some of this earlier.

372
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,500
Britney.

373
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,000
But is there, is there anything else you would?

374
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,500
You would add to that?

375
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,600
Yeah, I mean, I think I try to be really observant and remind myself and I say this to my team as well.

376
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,700
I am managing managers for the first time in my career.

377
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:31,900
So I am realizing that I am kind of playing back what I have learned in my experience and what I know of management a lot.

378
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:46,100
And I think some of just the obvious trigger signs are, you know, as someone eating lunch like we're very, were very aware of time zones, it breaks because we're remote company, but if someone eating lunch at 4:00 Is someone not taking PTO?

379
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,600
Time is someone sending emails after hours as someone have?

380
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,700
No again, we have transparent calendars.

381
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,100
So am I seeing someone's on back-to-back meetings?

382
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,300
And just kind of reminding yourself like we're not superhuman.

383
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,900
We cannot do this.

384
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:08,000
And I think, just by recognizing it with the team and letting them know, like, I will also say, like, I have to reschedule my calendar.

385
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,800
It's just too.

386
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,600
I have too much going on this week.

387
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It gives them kind of what Vicki was saying.

388
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,300
It lets them know it's okay.

389
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:21,400
Okay, so I think just really being observant of what's going on with your, your team and giving them an out.

390
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,100
Or sometimes.

391
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,200
I will just reschedule something.

392
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,500
I will say hey, sorry, calendars.

393
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,300
Crazy today.

394
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,500
I have nothing urgent for a one-on-one.

395
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,200
Let us move this to tomorrow if you want.

396
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,200
So, giving them that out.

397
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,300
I think really helps them feel a little relieved.

398
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,100
That's good.

399
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
That's really good.

400
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:54,800
The permission to you're giving permit, you're releasing permission, even by the language that you use with your team members and obviously, like modeling it as Leaders yourselves, is key for that accountability and behavior to manifest with your team members.

401
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,200
Are there any other points?

402
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Yeah, that is interesting because I was just having this conversation with Gina.

403
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,600
I am put us on the spot.

404
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:09,000
I think it was like last night and or like, one day this week and it was around.

405
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:18,000
It was around like, hey, I see that your notifications on or off and it's like these weird times that it comes on and off like your slack.

406
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,300
Like the green.is, the so interesting because we take that for granted, like when they green.is on, it means go.

407
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,300
Like in many ways.

408
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,800
It's like this person is available.

409
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,000
So go ahead and DM them.

410
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:42,100
Go ahead and go my slack versus controlling that even setting the boundaries even at that level and say, you know what, like I'ma put these boundaries in place, the tools have the capabilities for you to have Boundaries in place.

411
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:51,200
A lot of people don't even take advantage of that and I think as managers holding people to that holding people to, you know, time off at welcome.

412
00:33:51,200 --> 00:34:01,700
We like a lot of companies, you know, we, we have like the unlimited vacation policy and that's a double-edged sword because many people just don't take the vacations, right?

413
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:07,200
And so it means that we have to be more proactive around that, and we have some things in place that helps with that.

414
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:15,699
I am and, and I know we're getting to that Gina in a minute, but I think is having a pulse on the Small Things Brittany to what you're saying?

415
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,699
This person is responding after hours.

416
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,100
I haven't seen this person.

417
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,900
Take a vacation.

418
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,300
Can I look that up?

419
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,600
Have they not taking vacation level of energy?

420
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,500
I think is as well as a big is a big deal as well.

421
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:36,300
Like seeing their energy, you know this, you know your people well, you should know your people and when something is off and you feel like something's off.

422
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,900
Typically, it is off.

423
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,500
And so the question is, are you going to lean in and have the conversation?

424
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:51,000
I think that's something that I am learning every day as well as the leader in the fast-growing company is like those things matter and have them post when people really does matter.

425
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,900
Yeah, I think just add.

426
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:03,200
I think there's some very obvious signals that you can pick up on but then there's some of the not so obvious and that's where I think are.

427
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,300
We do a quarterly culture?

428
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,400
Survey that tells us so much about how our employees are feeling.

429
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,800
That's huge.

430
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:16,200
We also do I do 360 feedback, surveys with our teams with, with my directs.

431
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:29,700
I do them every six months which also tells us a lot of how they're doing and I think it gives them Overall, it gives them a really good idea of how their Partners think they're doing, and gives them some really great goals to work towards.

432
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,600
But just by that culture survey.

433
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,800
We monitor the trends.

434
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,700
We learn a lot from that, and we action a lot from that.

435
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,000
I have done these in the past and as an employee taking these, I have always liked, they don't read them.

436
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:52,200
But like being on the other side of it and like, we read every comment, and we literally make changes to policy and employee experience based on those comments.

437
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,200
Vicki, did you want to add anything?

438
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,500
Proud of have you +1 to everything that was said, yeah.

439
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,400
All right.

440
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Here's another question.

441
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,500
That's getting up.

442
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Voted pretty high.

443
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
What are low cost Solutions?

444
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,100
We can take to positively impact, our employees well-being.

445
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,700
I think that's a tough.

446
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,200
One.

447
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:35,300
One thing I would say is at least for me in my experience, educating myself on what burnout is similar like, really understanding it understanding what we can do to combat.

448
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,800
Some that's what are some, what are some of those therapy techniques.

449
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:47,300
What are some of those mindfulness techniques and then sharing that outright having discussions with your team, having discussions with the company talking about what this is talking about.

450
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,300
All of those things are University of Pennsylvania.

451
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,200
Did a study on resiliency.

452
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,200
So if you look up you can and the word Karma to erm a.

453
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:05,600
It they actually figured out all those pieces that kind of connect to what was really what creates resiliency, which is what helps with burnout.

454
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:05,900
Right?

455
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,300
And so there's like moments of positivity that can help with that.

456
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,000
So there's like a Magic Bullet.

457
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,300
I think this team kind of talked about how there wasn't one to fix burnout, but what are those little pieces that you can do?

458
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:27,200
Do to go and create more or build your resiliency, build your energy back up and really looking at those pieces to kind of help support some of that.

459
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:40,600
So that way, you know, it doesn't cost money to go and kind of do the research and share that back out and then maybe if you do have a budget, you can start finding other ways to build some of that in Yeah.

460
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,700
Yeah, Gina looks like we talked about like inexpensive ways.

461
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:52,300
I think that going back to the PTO thing and I see people having compliments inside of chat about the unlimited PTO and its controversial thing.

462
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,300
And you know for us we're in year 2 as a company.

463
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,800
Welcome, by the way, welcome is this platform that you guys are on today.

464
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,400
So welcome to welcome.

465
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:14,600
One of the things we were in year, two of our business of being in the market and what we It is look at your one and evaluating things, and we were asking what, what can we do better?

466
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:21,500
Right going back to the post surveys that we're getting from employees and asking the question, and we're startup, we were to like this young startup.

467
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,200
They were tripping over ourselves and we're running.

468
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:30,300
We're doing our best we can, and we tend to punch each other, you know, punch yourself in the face sometimes and Miss. opportunities.

469
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,400
When we saw it may be a glimmer of an opportunity that we should have taken.

470
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,600
And so we're constantly learning, right?

471
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:48,600
And one of the things we said, when we kicked off the show, Here we kicked off Wellness weekends, and it's a simple idea, but I think it has a high impact.

472
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,700
And what it means is that we are shutting down the first Friday of every month.

473
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,200
So we always have a three-day weekend.

474
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,600
So employees always have a three-day weekend, every single month.

475
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,500
Now when we do the calculations on that, as a business, that's almost like two weeks off.

476
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,000
That's 12 days a year.

477
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:26,100
That you have no option but to be off like we're forcing you to take 12 days off of year so that you can have a pause so that you have some intention around that three day weekend and sometimes, you know, the holiday kicks in, and they will be like a 40 weekend because a Monday is awful.

478
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,800
What have you?

479
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,700
But that's a small thing.

480
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,900
I think that we have been experimenting with this year.

481
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:41,000
And what would it helps with what it helps with as well, is when everybody is off, nobody's feeling like they have to be on.

482
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Quite a similar to some of the hard times have you taken off is because you're saying, you know what, we have to catch up so much.

483
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,600
It might take a week off.

484
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,100
Imagine.

485
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:59,300
All the emails have to catch up on those critical meetings that I want to be a part of when you shut down a company-wide, and we do it again.

486
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:07,000
One day a month that we focus on wellness, and we talked about how are you planning your Wellness weekend means that nobody else is on slide?

487
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,300
There is no other meeting happening.

488
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,700
You don't have to catch up because everybody's off.

489
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,500
And I think that's just an All way that.

490
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,900
And I think it's a cheap way actually because the Accord, the question was like, what's inexpensive ways.

491
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:27,300
I think is this is an inexpensive way to do that for you for your employees and something that we have been experimenting with and it's fun to see.

492
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,600
Yeah, we do a version of that.

493
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,000
We do two weeks, long breaks.

494
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:54,100
We do want it Fourth of July and when it Christmases and I think, what's most beneficial about it to your point is everyone just signing off the same time and then when you log back in after that 10 days because really from Friday that Monday, it's about 10 days off, you're signing on and you don't have an email inbox full that you have to catch up on.

495
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,100
You can actually enjoy the break and not think about what am I missing?

496
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,200
There're times when I have taken.

497
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,200
Off when no one else is taken off.

498
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
And I can't help but check slack, check email.

499
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,300
So I am a big fan of those, those brakes.

500
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,500
And we have we did the first one we did was right after covid.

501
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,700
And we were like, okay, people need to take some time, and we kept them because they have been so beneficial.

502
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,100
The other thing I would add is, you know, really, again, I think we're Berta.

503
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:37,300
We're very similar in terms of Zoom fatigue, as much as I can turn off cameras, taking walking meetings, thinking about When we can do a call and said seems to just really help people and sometimes it's like this can be 5 minutes.

504
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:42,200
We don't have a ton to catch up on just because it's a 30-minute meeting on your calendar, doesn't mean you need to use the whole time.

505
00:41:42,400 --> 00:42:11,800
So we're really big on sitting agendas and making sure I think I saw someone write in the chat, you know if you don't need to be there, feel free to decline the meeting, and we're not taking it personally, but I think also just being really intentional with your meetings and explaining why you have invited or what the context of the meeting is or what the goal of the meeting is, and then we have tried some other things at such as you know, employee LED self care, which I think just keeps the conversation going, whether it's meditation or workouts.

506
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,000
It's just letting people know that it's okay to do this during the day because we need to, and we need to focus on ourselves.

507
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:24,400
And that's actually, I don't think they always stick but I think it sends the right message and it really is appreciated.

508
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,800
So good.

509
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:29,800
All right.

510
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,900
I am going to jump into one of our highest voted questions goes into the company.

511
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,000
Topic category.

512
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:43,100
How do you prioritize employees mental health at a company level with limited time staff and other resources?

513
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:53,600
I think this the likes pulling similar threats of what we were just talking about, right?

514
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:59,000
I think that as Leaders it starts at the top down, so like for it's just us, right?

515
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,700
You're saying okay.

516
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,900
Can we afford to give everybody a force?

517
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,600
Can we shut the company down every Friday?

518
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,500
What does that look like?

519
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:21,400
So as the decision you have to make from the top down and then there's the when you think about empowering your employees, have the freedom to Have ownership about their mental health and preventing burnout.

520
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,000
I think that's probably the best thing we can do.

521
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:33,800
As Leaders is actually encouraging and holding folks accountable to take control of what they need because everybody needs something very different.

522
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,200
You know, I was a few weeks ago.

523
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,600
I had the pleasure of getting to know Arianna Huffington.

524
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:47,500
We were having a conversation, and she had this one question that I think for everybody as a manager here, I think for me, I wrote it down.

525
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:54,500
It's very simple, but I think it's very important and it was during the onboarding during the first 30 days.

526
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,800
Make sure you get time with your employee and ask them a simple question.

527
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,000
What is most important to you outside of work?

528
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,400
What is something that you're striving to do?

529
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:07,800
What's it?

530
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
What's a good life goal?

531
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,000
What's really important for you in this season?

532
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,300
And it sounds like a simple question.

533
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:21,700
But and then when you start to unpack that you start to realize as a manager, how do I hope that employee win on?

534
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,000
What's most important for them in this season?

535
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,900
What's a most important for her in the season?

536
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,300
So for example, an employee that lives in Tennessee?

537
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,400
She's remote.

538
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,500
She has a little girl, and she's involved in a sporting function.

539
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
She has to be at this time.

540
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,800
Every single Thursday is really important for her to be there.

541
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,500
It's like super important for her personally.

542
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:56,200
So now as a manager, you know, I am not going to book anything critical no meetings on that Thursday, because I don't want her to feel like she has to choose between that very important thing.

543
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,600
She has to go accomplish for her personally or being part of this meeting.

544
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:08,400
And so just having that self-awareness, as a leader, but also encouraging your employees to take full control of that and respecting that as well.

545
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,900
I think this is the way we scale this across with limited amount of resources.

546
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Sources, because all we have to do is Empower them to take ownership of it.

547
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:20,500
Is that the end of the day, you're only playing a part in their lives?

548
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:27,300
That's confound in this area, like, burnout and overwhelmed, like, seeps into every area.

549
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:27,600
Right?

550
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,800
And so, just understanding that better and empowering them to take control.

551
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,200
I think it's how we scale some of this with limited resources.

552
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,600
Empowerment is huge from the leadership and the other thoughts.

553
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,800
I think the other thing to ask is one, there is a cost to burn out.

554
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:53,500
I mean, mental health platforms, like Spring Health, Modern Health, they all have data around like, what the cost of it is.

555
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,200
We know there's a cost to turn over.

556
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,700
So there's actual like, monetary cost.

557
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,300
If you are having trouble kind of convincing, maybe leadership, there're dollars.

558
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,500
You can put behind it.

559
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:10,800
And then I think what we're gonna touch on like, the Letty, is something people are really craving and I think we have to ask ourselves.

560
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,900
You know, what can we change about the way we work?

561
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,800
That would help because I think in our heads we think are eight to five days a week.

562
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,200
That's how it's always been.

563
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,700
But does it have to be a why?

564
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,900
I think a lot of people, when we came into doing things virtually.

565
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,600
Oh, no, it's going to screw everything up.

566
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,900
Did not screw everything up.

567
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,100
We very clearly know how to, at least in most, I should say in all Industries.

568
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,000
Obviously, in some, it's very difficult to do that.

569
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:47,000
But in many is Actually possible, but we are so rigid in the way we think about how we sometimes operate that if we start there, really think about what problem are we trying to solve with helping people, and ensuring productivity?

570
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,400
Because there's this fear that if we don't do it to 5 Monday through Friday, right?

571
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:57,200
We're not going to be productive as a whole other topic in and of itself, but how do we then rethink how we do this?

572
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,500
Because maybe there's a better way to do it a different way to do it.

573
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,400
That would still get better results of someone's them more engaged.

574
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,800
Yeah, I think just to add to that.

575
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:13,100
The cost of not prioritizing it is detrimental to the business.

576
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:20,300
Think about how much time it takes to recruit and onboard and hire someone, and you have them for six months and you run them.

577
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,700
So dry that they're burnt out by the end of they leave.

578
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,700
You have to start that process all over again.

579
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:34,900
It's it really, I think it's super beneficial to have just an open dialogue about burnout and mental health and, and work-life balance.

580
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,900
And all of the above.

581
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,800
From day one and being able to offer those resources to your company and let them know your stance on it.

582
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:47,600
I think is so incredibly important and I think hearing from it top down which I think we have said a few times.

583
00:47:47,600 --> 00:48:01,500
Now are one of our co-founders, Pedro wrote a whole blog post on mental health and really just opened up to the company and it really showed just a vulnerable side of a Founder that you typically don't see.

584
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,500
And it made everyone feel like it's okay to have days that you're high.

585
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:11,600
You have highs and lows and it just really allowed people to relate to him and really just understand his stance.

586
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,600
So it was, I think really empowering.

587
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,600
That's great.

588
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,400
This company level support comes up.

589
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,300
I have another high vote on it.

590
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,000
I think we did answer a lot of it.

591
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,400
This question is very similar, are there policies that can be put in place at a company level.

592
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:38,000
And, so I think all of you have shared something about that, which I think is really it starts from the top and talking.

593
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:46,500
I am hearing empowerment of your employees and really creating that culture and environment where it's safe to be able to be vulnerable.

594
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,500
And be real.

595
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,500
So I think those are all powerful things.

596
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,600
Here's another question from Alexandria.

597
00:48:52,800 --> 00:49:01,600
How do you encourage people to prioritize treating their burnout when it feels like another task on their already unmanageable to-do list?

598
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:16,800
This actually came up and whenever meetings one of our team members left and the manager inherited the calendar, and they saw kind of what was on it.

599
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,500
So you like oh, I could have done a better job here.

600
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,500
It may be going through and helping them figure out what to prioritize.

601
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,500
How to think about it.

602
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,500
Another thing I have done with our people managers at least and I think it's a good exercise to kind of do in groups.

603
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,700
Is to really just sit down and ask each other.

604
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,600
How do we, what can we get?

605
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,800
Up, like our marketing team has sat down and done that before.

606
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,200
Like what do we stop doing?

607
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,400
And really when we say stop doing is not kind of sort of keep doing it.

608
00:49:45,400 --> 00:50:02,400
It's actually really stop doing it because we all agree that there's like too much right now, and we have to prioritize stuff and even just sitting down with someone else, because when you're in it, you're kind of too close to it and having an external person, come and look at what's going on, that kind of knows what your work is.

609
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,100
And they can say, hey, do you actually need to do that?

610
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,400
Or does that one really matter?

611
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,600
What's that one for?

612
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,800
Or and it might help to get that kind of separate View.

613
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,300
Yeah, I will follow on that Vicki.

614
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:15,800
I think.

615
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:21,900
Yeah, like the ideal focus, and we take that for granted for we just focus on the right things.

616
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:32,900
But actually there's probably 30 40 percent of the things that you're working on that can be optimized and or removed.

617
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:43,000
And you can focus that other 40% of energy on the other 60 and supercharged that for yourself for the business and for the results, but sometimes it's hard to say, no, and let go of things.

618
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,600
But in the reality is, I am a double down on things that are working.

619
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:53,300
And when they were down to things that have traction, given my limited T, my resources, I am gonna say no to a lot of things.

620
00:50:53,300 --> 00:51:05,600
So I can say yes, the right things and I just freeze up a lot of head space because now, you start your week, you know, these are the only three things I care about and these are the things that my manager cares about and what's going to get us results.

621
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,600
And then a super important, especially for start-up that you tend to just wear.

622
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:21,200
So many hats is being able to prioritize The things that actually matter one thing that I want to Anchor back to I think somebody talked about ending meetings early.

623
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:21,900
I love that.

624
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,100
I love the idea of ending meetings early like just because it's 30 minutes.

625
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:25,800
It doesn't need to be.

626
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:37,100
I remember when I was at Google we had these meetings that They were always like an hour meeting was to be 50 meetings and 30 minute meetings will always be 25-minute meetings.

627
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,200
And I remember being new employee at go on our side.

628
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,000
You know, what is because we have to walk from this building that this building.

629
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,200
I got to get on that silly Google bike and go from one building to the other building.

630
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,600
So they want like that buffer time, but we still need that buffer time.

631
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,900
Even now, even at the zoom level of connecting to another room.

632
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,800
Another meeting.

633
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,000
And so, in your Google calendar, if you go to your Google calendar, there are a settings.

634
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,100
And, in fact, Go ahead and drop the image inside of chat.

635
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,000
There's a setting that you can enable.

636
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,500
So every time you book a meeting, it always defaults to fight.

637
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:17,600
Give you a five or ten minute buffer to every meeting you said, and that's and then it takes your discipline to be able to cut it off at that point.

638
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,800
But at least you set it up and say, that's the time, we're going to be meeting with me.

639
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,600
Five minutes, Gap or 10 minutes in between.

640
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:28,200
All right.

641
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,400
I am going to go through these unless.

642
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,300
Did you have Brittany?

643
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,200
Another note on that?

644
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,100
Okay, I have got nine minutes left.

645
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:36,500
So I am going to try to get through as many questions as we can here.

646
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,300
This is more specific to sales roles.

647
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,100
How do you encourage reps to take time off?

648
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,000
Especially since quota is a large part of the Roll.

649
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,000
Tricky balance.

650
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,600
That's a tricky one.

651
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,000
Yeah, I think especially in sales.

652
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:05,500
This is a very tricky one because it's your like every day that I am off is actually hurting my performance quote unquote, right?

653
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:21,000
Because I am putting numbers on the board and I think it comes down to just Being able to manage a book of business in a way I think about, I think about sales folks as entrepreneurs is like they're running their own business, right?

654
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,800
So you could you have the advantage of running your own business?

655
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:39,000
You can say, you know what I am going to use Monday through Thursday to hammer this home in Friday's, you know, I am going to take, I am gonna do half days on Friday, and I am actually going to go to a coffee shop and do this, but it's around owning your book of business in a way that as an entrepreneur, you can think about it.

656
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,100
And say, you know what, like I get to own my business.

657
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,300
And I am a run it this kind of way.

658
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,200
So maybe Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday are going to be like this.

659
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,000
Maybe Mondays are going to be like this in Friday is going to be like that.

660
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,900
I think you do have that Advantage.

661
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:07,800
If again, if you take the owners ownership mentality, it's, you know, one of our core values on at welcome is simply own it, and it talks about like, taking full ownership of it, no matter how big or how small, and I think applying that to your time and how you work.

662
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:13,300
I think in the sales and sales case can be very fruitful as well.

663
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,200
I think one thing that we do it, Brax is we enforce decompression days.

664
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:26,400
So, we will tell people take the day off after 12 or take the full day off.

665
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,200
Sometimes, we will say, spend $50 on your brakes card or a hundred dollars in a bricks card, and go do something to decompress.

666
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:37,700
And I think again, it just gives them that like we're giving that permission and pushing you guys.

667
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:47,700
And then we also share in our slack channels of, you know, tell us what you did today and I think it just kind of lets people be a little more comfortable taking that and now, That everyone else is taking it too.

668
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,100
It's great.

669
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:52,500
Britney.

670
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,600
Looks like we have another question.

671
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,500
Actually for you.

672
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,900
How do you suggest dealing with imposter syndrome and overcoming those negative effects?

673
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,400
That's a great question.

674
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:12,300
It's, I think it's something that You just have to shove to the back of your mind because it's really hard.

675
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,300
And at the end of the day, you have to remind yourself.

676
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,500
It's so much of your, it's so much of you doing it.

677
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,400
And what I am really, I am huge on self-reflection.

678
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:27,600
So at the end of every quarter, I have written down accomplishments and improvements and things that I want to work on.

679
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,600
But I also don't set the bar too high.

680
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:38,500
I am not expecting 20, huge accomplishments and I do this with my team to wear even if we look at daily goals when we're Prioritizing weekly goals.

681
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,400
Most days, I will just set if I can accomplish these three things today.

682
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,500
I have had a good day.

683
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:50,200
And then when I reflected, I write this all down on a notepad so that I can look back week to week at the end of each quarter.

684
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:55,500
It's a nice reminder that I am not doing as bad as the little voice in my head is telling me I am doing.

685
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,800
I am not even close to it.

686
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:10,300
And I think also between that and performance review is just, you know, I think it really is in your head so much, but I am really huge on documentation and being able to look back at things and it's just a nice reminder.

687
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:15,800
And then the one other thing is I have a happy days filter of every time I get praise or recognition.

688
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,200
I save it in my email and I go back and look at that and I it's just again a nice reminder that.

689
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,500
I am in my own head, and I am doing good work and it really helps.

690
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,600
So good.

691
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,800
I think I want to start that happy praise folder.

692
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,000
I have seen Pope affirmation, Post-it notes as an exercise as well.

693
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,900
Put that on your wall.

694
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,200
Vicky any added thoughts.

695
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,800
I would say also, you make sure you have a good support network around you.

696
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,600
I think similar to Britney's point.

697
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,300
It's in our head and for sitting in our head alone that's even worse.

698
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,500
Right?

699
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:58,900
But when you have other people who remind you of the things that you're really good at that can be really powerful.

700
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,200
I like how Jeff mention the bonus baby doll.

701
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
Go back and look through my own boat asleep.

702
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,600
Eat if I am having a crappy day because it does remind me like, oh, yeah.

703
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:17,900
I did all these things and you know, our brain naturally, we will go to the — so you need to yank it out of there because our threat response is Hi to just sit in the positive for a bit and really think about.

704
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,400
Okay.

705
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,600
What am I really proud of another thing that my team does is every month.

706
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,900
We have a highlights and learnings slide that I have everyone fill out.

707
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:32,400
So we talked about the things that we were really proud of and the things that we learned, so we're constantly one, it's to help.

708
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,100
Make sure that we're talking about the mistakes we made.

709
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,000
And what we learn from them to is like, hey, what were you really proud of?

710
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,300
So that you remember that you did something great because my type performance review comes around, sometimes you're like, I don't even remember what I did last month.

711
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,800
By the way, I will jump in and say at welcome bonus, Lee feed is the most lit feed.

712
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,200
Welcome, and it's so good because you see it's like, it's like the Love Fest.

713
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,000
Everybody's like, hey, this person is awesome.

714
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,400
This person.

715
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:57,500
No.

716
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,300
No, you're awesome.

717
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:04,300
Is like, I would love seeing and I think it's interesting because I think it's correlated in helping burnout as well.

718
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,300
Because one of the reasons for a burnout was in a symptom of it.

719
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:12,400
It's feeling like you're not recognized enough and I think small things like a bonus.

720
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Lee recognition can go a long.

721
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,600
Way, I think for folks.

722
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,300
All right.

723
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,900
I don't know if we could fit two questions because there's some a couple of really good questions.

724
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,300
But here's one.

725
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,300
How do you signal burnout to your boss?

726
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:32,800
When everyone around, you seem to be doing just fine with the same or even more work?

727
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,700
I think the best advice I received early in my career was don't compare your beginning to someone else's middle.

728
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,500
And you have to remember, we're all starting at different times.

729
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,700
And I am also just the I have over the years.

730
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,100
I was always like how I want to be, I want to always be positive for my boss.

731
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,500
I always want to show up for my boss.

732
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,600
But again, we're human, and we're going to have bad days and I find that just having that level of transparency with my boss.

733
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:08,200
He will actually recognize when I am having an off day and I think Just really helps to just be really open.

734
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:21,200
You have also at least I talk to my colleagues sometimes and I think we make assumptions because everyone's kind of put on their work face when they're at work or you know, especially if you're a leader, right?

735
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:32,400
Because you bring the weather so it may not be actually true that they're doing the same or even more work and it'd be a good way to if you can is you feel safe enough to gut check that too.

736
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,900
And said, maybe actually find out, you're all kind of in the same boat and then that's even easier to go and bring to a leader.

737
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,200
It's great.

738
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,000
All right one last question.

739
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,600
I am pulling up Spencer's question here?

740
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,300
I don't know if you all see it.

741
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:53,200
It says now that I have been remote for two plus years having zero decompression time between work and family.

742
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:58,000
I hate traffic, but that who I just lost it.

743
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,100
There it is.

744
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,600
Okay, I hate traffic, but that was my deep compression time.

745
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,500
How are you solving that for yourself and your employees?

746
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,600
That's a real one.

747
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,700
I hate you.

748
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,100
I really wanted percent.

749
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,800
I hate traffic, but I was into, I love driving.

750
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,100
Actually, it's a form.

751
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:25,600
Driving is a form of self care, for me, like sometimes when I need some space, just going for a drive actually helps.

752
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:36,400
And my wife knows that is when I get to actually turn up the music and Feel the Bass without like freaking everybody out in the house with like the music I listened to or any of that.

753
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,800
I think it's my time.

754
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,500
And, so I don't know what the solution is.

755
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:49,700
On this, especially in, this remote World outside of self-awareness, and knowing what you need, because you get to manage that time.

756
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:55,000
And for me, it starts and stops at the calendar level, like me being able to block off.

757
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:06,600
Even before I start my day, being able to block off that buffer time of transition, whether that's a work out, whether that's a walk, whether that's putting my little girl down for a nap, right?

758
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,500
So yeah, I don't have the answers Spencer, but I miss those days.

759
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,400
Days of filling the base with music as well.

760
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,500
Love it, and I see Vicky.

761
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,100
You take short walks for your decompression time, Brittany.

762
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,000
What do you do for decompressing?

763
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,300
Oh, you're a mute.

764
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:33,800
Sorry, I made it the whole time without doing that and, you know, with one minute to go.

765
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,400
But yeah, big on going for walks with my dog.

766
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:46,100
I think just spending time with my dog, in general gives me like so much joy, so as much as I can get outside to decompress with her, it really helps love it.

767
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,000
Wow.

768
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:47,200
Okay.

769
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,900
Well, these wraps are time.

770
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:55,000

01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:58,700
First and foremost oxygen mask on ourselves and decompressed.

788
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,600
Take the walks.

789
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,100
Go, grab some ice cream.

790
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,100
Enjoy the beautiful sun, if it's shining out there.

791
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:04,800
All right.

792
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,300
Take care.

793
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,100
Until next time.

794
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:06,900

00:20:56,385 --> 00:21:02,985
So even right here where represented all over the world where are you Abhishek and Roberto?

46
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:13,385
I will kick off, I mostly on the Eastern time zone right now, I am in Puerto Rico but you know in a couple weeks I am going to be in Philadelphia.

47
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:24,485
And so this is a beauty about remote, work could be wherever in the world Yeah, I am in Bangalore in India, but I am working on PT time zone.

48
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:28,085
So welcome everyone and great to meet with you.

49
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:30,885
Awesome.

50
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:32,485
That's cool.

51
00:21:32,485 --> 00:21:37,785
It's truly distributed represented here and even in our audience, which is amazing.

52
00:21:37,785 --> 00:21:39,685
And that's why engagement is.

53
00:21:39,685 --> 00:21:45,985
So, top of mind, takes a lot of intentionality, and I am excited to be able to dive into that a little bit more with each of you.

54
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:49,385
Can you tell me a little bit more about your company's?

55
00:21:49,385 --> 00:21:56,685
And how you all are solving for the Transformer, formative work place today with distributed teams.

56
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,985
If you said you weren't, you want to take that one first and then I will jump in.

57
00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:11,385
Oh, so you know very quickly about good ERA in very simple, terms could areas like an know what?

58
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:20,785
We call an Airbnb of volunteering, where we work with nonprofits, thousands of nonprofits across, more than 100 countries globally.

59
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:29,085
Understand their volunteering in requirements on board them on good errors platform and offer it to employees of our customers.

60
00:22:29,385 --> 00:22:36,285
So that Employee across any part of the world can volunteer in a very, very simple Manner.

61
00:22:36,785 --> 00:22:44,085
And the reason why we started that was, you know, it's just so strange that in this world volunteering is just so difficult.

62
00:22:44,585 --> 00:22:51,485
You know, it's so easy to get a pizza delivered home or get a cab but it's just so difficult to volunteer and that's what we wanted to Saul.

63
00:22:51,485 --> 00:23:00,085
And, you know, currently work with the hundreds of companies with 16 Fortune, 500 with 7 million employees volunteering with us across.

64
00:23:00,185 --> 00:23:02,785
Asset globe and, you know, great too great to be here.

65
00:23:03,985 --> 00:23:11,285
And you know, as soon as I heard about the topic and I know this was been in the works for a little while.

66
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:32,885
I was just intrigued because I think that volunteering and I know I am talk about welcome here in a second, but I think volunteering is so important in connecting people together where I like when you can work side by side with someone for a good cause Beyond like your day-to-day job, it does something pretty special and income and uniting employees for a bigger.

67
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:35,885
Cause I have been Pretty Hands-On with volunteering.

68
00:23:35,985 --> 00:23:41,585
Like, in the real world virtually though, I haven't really experienced much of it.

69
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:45,585
And, so I am looking forward to learning what this is all about, as well.

70
00:23:46,985 --> 00:23:48,885
So guys, my name is Roberto Ortiz.

71
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,985
I am co-founder and CEO of welcome.

72
00:23:51,185 --> 00:23:52,985
Welcome is the platform that we're hosting.

73
00:23:52,985 --> 00:23:54,085
This experience on.

74
00:23:54,685 --> 00:24:00,485
What we do is we help companies that have distributed teams bringing them together in more intentional ways.

75
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:10,585
And so employee experiences actually draw Drive a lot of connection belonging amounts of months of work force and our technology makes it.

76
00:24:10,585 --> 00:24:13,985
So it's much easier and engaging for everybody that's participating.

77
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:22,985
And so we're serving customers from the startup that has a remote team to accompany a five, ten thousand people that have employees around the world.

78
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:23,885
And so that's what we did.

79
00:24:23,985 --> 00:24:24,885
And I am glad to be here.

80
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:25,485
Thanks for being here.

81
00:24:26,585 --> 00:24:27,185
Awesome.

82
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:27,685
Thank you.

83
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:29,585
Both for those intros.

84
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,885
You know, I would love to kick it off, actually, with this survey.

85
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:38,085
That Abhishek your team had conducted with your own customers.

86
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:47,085
And so if we could pull that on stage, it actually gives some really good insights into why orgs are opting into virtual volunteering.

87
00:24:47,085 --> 00:25:03,885
So as we're seeing here, 33% care about Community impact, aligned in our cause areas, 33% care about Employee Engagement, 25% employee well-being, and mental health, and 9% care about the employee Learning and Development.

88
00:25:03,985 --> 00:25:08,585
Mint Abhishek, could you elaborate on this a little bit more for us?

89
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:10,285
Yeah, absolutely.

90
00:25:10,285 --> 00:25:27,485
And you know us, as we all know, the pandemic has, you know, had a huge impact on everyone of us across the world and the need to do good or you know, help or contribute to the world is higher than ever before.

91
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:35,085
So everyone feels that urge and need to do good, but because of constraints in a bit What's the pandemic?

92
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:46,785
It's extremely difficult to go out there and help and contribute but you know, how do you then convert this intention and the need to do good and it's just not, you know, from a healthcare and education perspective.

93
00:25:46,785 --> 00:26:23,385
But you know, things like Racial equality and climate change and now her whole bunch of issues, especially the younger folks are extremely motivated to do something, and there needs to be a channelization of these energies and this need and Motivation in a positive manner and that's where virtual volunteering comes in is how can companies effectively channelize, the need, an urge to contribute in a much more engaging and effective manner than that's even the alignment with social causes and, you know, it's just not a greenwashing kind of thing, but it's actually very, very meaningful.

94
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:33,885
It's not top down, but a very inclusive, very Democratic way in, which employees can come together to do good, another same time, it's probably the most meaningful Employee Engagement.

95
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:47,585
You know, in today's world where we talk about, you know, the great resignation or the great reshuffle and every companies trying to do something around engagement which is very you know check the box kind of thing with just seems.

96
00:26:47,585 --> 00:26:50,085
Okay, why am I doing it versus doing something?

97
00:26:50,085 --> 00:27:03,785
Which is actually meaningful something, which is helping someone in need something, where you use your time and skills, effectively is just so much more satisfying for you individually, and that's where the meaningful employing.

98
00:27:03,985 --> 00:27:07,985
A judgment comes in and the last piece is around this mental health and well-being.

99
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:17,785
And you know, we all know that when you volunteer there is something called as oxy toxin that's a hormone which gets released which, you know, makes you feel happier.

100
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:24,085
And, you know, everyone wants a lot more happiness today and this is just a beautiful way of doing it.

101
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:30,685
Where you know, it's your helping someone and feeling happy and as you do something for someone you also learn by using your skills.

102
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:33,885
You know you might be an intern somewhere but you are helping.

103
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,785
Nonprofit are really, really big way and that's the Learning and Development.

104
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:40,685
So these are just some of the different ways in which, you know, volunteering is.

105
00:27:40,685 --> 00:27:48,685
So, so very powerful, and we have customers seeing the direct benefit of it as their employees volunteer across the world.

106
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:52,785
Mmm, that's really.

107
00:27:52,785 --> 00:28:05,685
It's actually, I think, I think I just go back to, you know, when you were just, again, my experience in volunteering typically when you're volunteering, you think that?

108
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:15,085
Hey, I am gonna go help a group of people or, you know, I am going to partner with my friends, are going to go volunteer all day or take a trip and help clean this up or go.

109
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:28,485
He will be Hands-On and the school and go ready to And you do that with all the right intentions and typically people go to do it because they want to help people in many ways.

110
00:28:28,485 --> 00:28:41,585
Just like you're saying you walk away from that being helped so much more profoundly yourself and your team walks away with the better scent of accomplishment, not just because they help somebody.

111
00:28:41,585 --> 00:28:50,585
But this something within them I remember going to one trip I thought that hey we could just we have to go help me schools we have to help put the plumbing inside these Schools that don't have Plumbing.

112
00:28:50,585 --> 00:28:55,585
We have to go figure this out and I went for like two weeks, and we're working in the Sun and doing all of this work.

113
00:28:57,085 --> 00:29:00,285
But it was the most rewarding thing for me like fine back home.

114
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:13,185
It wasn't that I was hoping people but it was the appreciation for the people that are on the ground that people that do this every single day, the people that are inside of these, you know, like these volunteering.

115
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:17,485
Hubs that are dedicated the entire lives to go make a difference, right?

116
00:29:17,485 --> 00:29:21,885
And then you get to an Of that purpose that they do every single day.

117
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:27,785
And that just, you just walk away just more much more impacted, than anything else and so, I just, I don't know.

118
00:29:27,785 --> 00:29:30,285
I am just a big fan of doing things like this.

119
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:37,585
I think, remote, we may be good to kind of talk about, like, what are the opportunities in doing this remotely?

120
00:29:37,885 --> 00:29:40,185
And what are the challenges in doing a remotely?

121
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:44,385
Like, I am curious to say like what are like, at a high level?

122
00:29:44,385 --> 00:29:49,285
I think that, you know, some volunteering things, you can't do, because you can't go pick up.

123
00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:51,485
Paint brush and go pink or school.

124
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:51,985
Right.

125
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:57,285
There is probably a ton that you could do that.

126
00:29:57,285 --> 00:30:03,685
Even like if you think about like us as many ways like knowledge workers, there's a lot of things that we could do that.

127
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:10,785
Maybe what you and your company do is unlock that and really start to catalyze.

128
00:30:10,785 --> 00:30:19,385
Those kind of things, I would be curious to learn like from your perspective, what are you seeing being some of the common things that companies are doing remotely?

129
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:22,485
Virtually that you really can't do, right?

130
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:23,685
If it's in the physical world.

131
00:30:24,585 --> 00:30:25,285
So absolutely.

132
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:37,485
And I think the first thing is I we have seen teams being distributed across time zones locations languages and how do you bring a team together and do something, which is Meaningful?

133
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:49,285
One of our most popular volunteering activities, is recording, audio books for blind, kids, you know, we're a team comes together on a virtual call.

134
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:59,585
There is a good are a host, you know, someone like Carla would be hosting you today where they do some fun icebreakers to an orientation about the nonprofit.

135
00:30:59,785 --> 00:31:12,185
And then there are individual audio books, which are given to employees that they can record, and these audio books, once recorded and Q Cedar given to a local nonprofit, which works a blind kids, and these nonprofits is spread across the world with good error.

136
00:31:12,185 --> 00:31:22,085
So if you're a team in the US and the East Coast, a non-profit in New York or in California or in Dubai, or Singapore or Bangalore, They are local nonprofits who benefit from it.

137
00:31:22,685 --> 00:31:23,985
It's a very simple activity.

138
00:31:23,985 --> 00:31:26,585
Takes just, you know, one hour to do it.

139
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:27,885
It's very fulfilling.

140
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:31,885
It's also something where you don't require a lot of preparation.

141
00:31:31,885 --> 00:31:36,485
It's really, really fun, very engaging and you feel really, really happy after it.

142
00:31:36,485 --> 00:31:58,785
So it's something you know really wonderful and there are volunteering activities across different cause areas of its stem education, climate change, you know, Pride accessibility dni, and we work with a lot of these what we call employee resource groups, or ERG is our communities within companies to help them further their cause that they care about.

143
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:04,685
So, so that's just one example of activities in other ones are reviewing resumes for you.

144
00:32:04,985 --> 00:32:16,185
In a lot of you don't have access to high-quality resumes, you could review those resumes, make it high quality, and they might get a job, which is just, you know, they would never get access to Talent like this.

145
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:19,385
So we work with an apple or an Amazon or an Airbnb.

146
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:23,985
And, you know, I would have loved to have someone at Apple review my résumé.

147
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:28,785
You know, when I was a kid and that's something, you know, only possible through volunteering.

148
00:32:28,785 --> 00:32:35,985
So, it's really amazing, the kind of value that you could add remotely in just an hour together as a team and also have fun together.

149
00:32:36,985 --> 00:32:40,185
I mean, just by you even talk about this, it makes me feel good.

150
00:32:40,185 --> 00:32:40,685
How many?

151
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:44,085
I mean can we do some hands in chat and you feel you feeling good?

152
00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:49,385
Now, do you realize you're volunteering yet and the thought in the thinking about tearing makes you just feel?

153
00:32:49,485 --> 00:32:50,385
I feel so much better.

154
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:55,785
I, first of all we have to figure out how to do one of these things internally here at welcome.

155
00:32:55,785 --> 00:33:09,385
So in the Green Room which apart talk about like getting hooked up at figuring this out but at a high level I just, I don't know, I just, I just feel pretty bought into this whole opportunity of volunteering remotely.

156
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:11,985
So and we do now set up because I will get us off.

157
00:33:11,985 --> 00:33:13,685
Try, these are good questions.

158
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:14,385
Yeah, I know.

159
00:33:14,385 --> 00:33:14,985
Thank you.

160
00:33:15,085 --> 00:33:17,485
Thank you both for leaning into it.

161
00:33:18,185 --> 00:33:26,785
So, I kind of dig more into the challenges because engaging employees is hard remote.

162
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:29,385
Everything feels a little bit extra.

163
00:33:29,385 --> 00:33:41,985
You know, we don't have those water cooler moments where we just run into the office, and we can have, you know, a quick little chat, connect even solve problems in those asynchronous informal manners, right?

164
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:48,885
We don't have that and I think about volunteering Robbie were touching this bit being there in person.

165
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:57,985
And, like, Really solving for whether it's like building the house for somebody or feeding somebody like you don't really have that virtually.

166
00:33:57,985 --> 00:34:02,785
So I do see how the things that you're calling out.

167
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:09,585
Can help bring that oxytocin but I have since you know there's a little further intentionality that's needed.

168
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:13,585
How do you guys solve for that in this evolving?

169
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,585
Virtual District distributed world that we're in right now?

170
00:34:18,185 --> 00:34:19,784
You know, you constantly have to innovate Constant.

171
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:20,784
Had to be creative.

172
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:26,685
How you guys solving for both of you solving for this, for your customers, and for your own employees?

173
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:36,284
So I will jump in and give it back just a broader one and then I mean Abhishek and you can bring it home with like you know the work that you're doing I think high level.

174
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:48,685
So for us and I will just speak about because a lot of people here that are working remotely or hybrid type of setup or are trying to figure out and pull engagement at their companies as well as.

175
00:34:48,685 --> 00:35:01,885
So for us at welcome we're we were born a remote, we're staying remote, that's what we do, and then we huddle people upright regionally or yearly For in-person activities, just from a cultural perspective.

176
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:20,085
I think something to just acknowledge is that throughout the last two years we were all forced to go remote and being forced to go remote, meaning means that you necessarily then, I mean you didn't opt into it, you're just figuring it out as you go, and we're all honest, we have been trying to figure it out as we go.

177
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:30,885
But I think the companies that buy into being remote first or 100% remote or Embracing remote and distributed teams.

178
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:48,285
I think it starts at the onboarding of bringing employee in and saying like your part of remote culture, that means that the way we operate the way we function is X y&z the way that we connect is a b and c versus this sort of hodgepodge that we have been in.

179
00:35:48,285 --> 00:35:54,285
We have been forced to figure it out and have a lot of questions and I think, honestly, like organizations.

180
00:35:54,285 --> 00:36:02,685
Haven't really figured it out because they have been sort of stuck in the Person only being forced to go remote hoping that we can come back to in person.

181
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:17,685
And what we're finding is that there's tension and pool where employees don't want that and people want flexibility, but the processes and practices have not been matured in a lot of organizations especially organizations that didn't start with remote first.

182
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:20,985
And, so I think organizations that have already been functioning remote.

183
00:36:20,985 --> 00:36:26,585
We have figured out how to have an amazing culture and how to drive connection among their employees.

184
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:51,985
So it's not that it's not possible, but it's actually something you have to be very intentional about Can and just to add to that, you know what you have seen amongst, the team is, sometimes the remote is tends to become very transactional that okay, this is a meeting, this is a call, this is the agenda, and we don't know each other as humans or you know, who are we as people?

185
00:36:52,785 --> 00:37:14,585
And you need a platform where you could be in a vulnerable where you could be sensitive, very could share stories Beyond work and that's where you know, to an extent volunteering comes in where You know when you see nonprofits when you see, you know folks on the ground having so much more problems and yourself, you tend to become a lot more emotional.

186
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:34,885
You tend to become a lot more sensitive, you become more resilient and you start sharing a lot more and you feel safe sharing in the in that you know group or in that time and that builds connection and that bills, you know, empathy and that bills, you know like a family feeling where you feel safe to share things with each other and that Pins.

187
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,985
Only because that's atmosphere gets created during a voluntary experience.

188
00:37:39,185 --> 00:37:45,985
Very learn about the nonprofit about the cause about things which people go through about in all the good and bad things happening.

189
00:37:45,985 --> 00:37:46,985
I was in the world.

190
00:37:47,085 --> 00:37:55,985
And when you as a group and as a team come together and go through that, emotional experience, share stories in a work together, create something, which is Meaningful.

191
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:59,985
You feel a lot more connected and that builds human connection.

192
00:37:59,985 --> 00:38:02,585
And we were on a volunteering call.

193
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:19,485
Where there was a CEO there was An intern and there was a fire old kid and the kid didn't know that this who is the CEO and who's the intern and, you know, just talking as normal people and that created such a great bond between the CEO and the intern, which was never possible earlier.

194
00:38:19,485 --> 00:38:26,485
So I think it brings every human to the human angle rather than designations and titles and roles.

195
00:38:26,785 --> 00:38:44,485
And that makes it a really beautiful experience and that creates something which, you know, we sometimes gray for in the virtual world and That's what we try and do is also build connections, you know, create empathy, and emotions in a very structured environment through the volunteer experience across the year.

196
00:38:44,485 --> 00:38:48,485
And it's just not about doing it once a year during givingtuesday Thanksgiving.

197
00:38:48,485 --> 00:38:53,785
But doing it frequently, you want to build connection and everyone is passionate about different things.

198
00:38:53,785 --> 00:39:00,085
You know, someone likes to work for pet, animals for climate change to stem education for women and girls and across the year.

199
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:03,885
There are moments where you could do it and it creates, you know, communities.

200
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:10,785
Within the company that become really strong and connected and that's what you have seen happen at good area as well.

201
00:39:12,585 --> 00:39:13,485
That's awesome.

202
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:24,585
I totally agree on that human to human connection and being able to be intentional to enable those very human real authentic, moments virtually with your remote teams.

203
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:27,685
I think that is the challenge of what we're figuring out.

204
00:39:27,685 --> 00:39:31,085
But these are some great ideas and insights.

205
00:39:31,685 --> 00:39:36,085
We have got about a few minutes left before we jump into our volunteering activity.

206
00:39:36,085 --> 00:39:37,485
So I didn't want to open up.

207
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:42,185
If there're any questions that you all have for our panelists, feel free to drop them.

208
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:43,485
The Q&A tab.

209
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:46,585
In the meantime, I have got here.

210
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:53,385
One last question, about mental health and well-being, this is top of Mind top priority.

211
00:39:54,285 --> 00:39:55,185
You know, Roberto.

212
00:39:55,185 --> 00:40:08,585
You recently just signed a pledge with Thrive about mental health, and wellness, and the accountability that you along with 80 other companies and gadara, hope you all sign that pledge as well.

213
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:15,285
You know, a lot of folks are beginning to see the value of this, for their organizations?

214
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:21,185
How are you all thinking about mental health and wellbeing for your employees?

215
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:27,985
And are you seeing any great best practices across your customers?

216
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,985
You know, would love any inputs here.

217
00:40:33,285 --> 00:40:35,385
Yeah thanks for teeing that up Tina.

218
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:57,785
Yeah we signed a pledge and a partnership with Thrive and a bunch of other organizations as well and I think just kind of like put a like just whole space for that I think it's we're all in this like continue a journey of how to want support our employees support our customers and also as Leaders figure it out ourselves right?

219
00:40:57,785 --> 00:41:01,685
I think well-being and preventing burnout starts at the top.

220
00:41:01,885 --> 00:41:10,285
And so, we're burnt out as leaders, and we're not showing it and exhibiting it, and taking days off and, and practicing the things that we need to practice being.

221
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:14,785
Well, there's going to be hard for us to try to support our employees and doing the same.

222
00:41:14,885 --> 00:41:31,685
And so for me, I say that, like, for me to hear myself speak that because I need to do that more often myself, in terms of the Pledge, you know, we're just committed to just, you know, mental health is a core, a core requirement for all of us to show up.

223
00:41:31,885 --> 00:41:33,285
Up while and do our jobs.

224
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:36,285
Well, if our employees are well then they're going to do their best work.

225
00:41:36,985 --> 00:41:52,885
Now, the challenge that typically has also is like when you're in a start-up and you're running at 100 miles an hour, being able to know when to pull over and take the rest stops, it's super important.

226
00:41:52,885 --> 00:42:01,085
And I think that the hard thing for companies that are growing companies that are moving, fast is the balance of hey we're running a hundred miles an hour.

227
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:01,785
So how do we do?

228
00:42:02,485 --> 00:42:09,285
When we understand that this is a marathon, but it's a marathon of seven minute miles, meaning that we're running constantly.

229
00:42:09,385 --> 00:42:15,585
How do we look at well-being and mental health, in that demanding type of environment?

230
00:42:15,585 --> 00:42:17,585
And that means that we have to be really intentional.

231
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:19,885
It doesn't happen by mistake, right?

232
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:31,685
So for us even signing the pledge, is us saying that really continue to invest in this stuff and yes, we have, you know, we basically have some things internally that support the balance of Mental Health.

233
00:42:31,785 --> 00:42:46,685
Health and just being well, one example of that is every Friday of the first Friday of every month, we take off as an entire company, and we dedicated to just well-being, we call it Wellness, Wellness weekends.

234
00:42:46,685 --> 00:42:49,985
And so that means that every employee has a three-day weekend, every single month.

235
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:57,385
That means that almost two weeks, out the ear because you Des 12 business days, out the year, almost 2 weeks out of the Year.

236
00:42:57,685 --> 00:42:58,585
We're shutting down.

237
00:42:58,585 --> 00:43:04,985
And we're seeing go do what recharges your As an employee at that, meaning spending time with your family.

238
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:06,885
And that means taking your kids to the park.

239
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:10,185
If that means to sleep in it, for the whole day, you go do that.

240
00:43:10,185 --> 00:43:13,285
And so that's one small thing that we have decided to do at the top of the year.

241
00:43:13,285 --> 00:43:16,685
And it's been phenomenal, but we can do so much more, right?

242
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:20,485
And so the pledge is really a pledge of continuous Improvement for us.

243
00:43:23,085 --> 00:43:27,085
Yeah, and just to mention from a site in the interest of time.

244
00:43:27,085 --> 00:43:50,085
I think one thing which we do very intentionally is that in a good area for us as a family and you know you find a safe space inside your family to share a lot of things from a mental health perspective is that you know, you don't or you can't share and if you can't share, things don't get resolved and that leads to more issues and concerns.

245
00:43:50,085 --> 00:44:09,085
So, think the spirit of family Is that you can share and that comes from, you know, starting off in India, where it's a very strong connection that you build with the family and get a very strong sense of a safe space to share anything about anyone and problem solve together without being judgmental.

246
00:44:09,085 --> 00:44:22,585
So, I know we are out of time but just wanted to share as to how do you think about a company as a family and, you know, create that environment that everyone is there for everyone for, you know, during all ups and downs.

247
00:44:24,685 --> 00:44:25,685
So good.

248
00:44:25,885 --> 00:44:26,485
Wow.

249
00:44:26,485 --> 00:44:27,885
Thank you, Abhishek.

250
00:44:27,885 --> 00:44:32,185
Thank you, Roberto for sharing your insights experiences.

251
00:44:32,185 --> 00:44:37,285
Best practices we're grateful for this time.

252
00:44:37,585 --> 00:44:50,185
All right, so we're now going to flip the switch here and move into a virtual group volunteering activity for the lgbtq+ community.

253
00:44:50,185 --> 00:44:53,285
And I would love to bring Carla to the stage.

254
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:55,085
Each will you join me?

255
00:44:57,385 --> 00:44:57,985
Awesome.

256
00:44:57,985 --> 00:44:58,585
Okay.

257
00:45:00,485 --> 00:45:03,585
Hey, thank you so much, Gina.

258
00:45:03,885 --> 00:45:11,285
What a great conversation and what a great segue into our gadara volunteering virtual volunteering event.

259
00:45:11,285 --> 00:45:12,085
I should say.

260
00:45:12,185 --> 00:45:14,985
And again, happy pride month, everybody, my name is Carla.

261
00:45:14,985 --> 00:45:23,085
Curtsinger, I am a gadara Ambassador, and I am joined by my colleague Deb who be helping me out in the chat window.

262
00:45:23,185 --> 00:45:30,085
We're so excited that you're here today for our virtual volunteering event activity.

263
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:38,585
We're going to work together to write and decorate messages of love for the lgbtq+ Elders of color.

264
00:45:38,585 --> 00:45:40,485
This is a really unique opportunity.

265
00:45:40,485 --> 00:45:52,485
You think about the world as it is today, think about being a person and a person, a lgbtq+ person Generations ago right?

266
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:54,485
A much different world back then.

267
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,685
Those people are now our elders.

268
00:45:56,685 --> 00:46:03,485
And so you get the opportunity to create virtual Nation walls to tell them that we support them.

269
00:46:03,585 --> 00:46:07,685
We know that the journey they have been through and now they're their elders.

270
00:46:07,885 --> 00:46:11,185
And obviously their communities may feel like they're shrinking as well.

271
00:46:11,485 --> 00:46:16,385
So you get the opportunity to say that we're there with them, and we want to show our love and support.

272
00:46:16,385 --> 00:46:23,385
So what a unique opportunity, thank you so much for sharing your time today and working on this activity with us.

273
00:46:23,685 --> 00:46:29,485
So why you'd expect with this is a short activity today, we're going to start out obviously we're doing the introductions now.

274
00:46:29,685 --> 00:46:31,585
We're going to do Quick Icebreaker.

275
00:46:31,585 --> 00:46:35,185
I am going to test your knowledge during pride month.

276
00:46:35,285 --> 00:46:38,585
Then I will tell you a little bit about the nonprofit that you're serving today.

277
00:46:38,785 --> 00:46:45,685
Give you some quick, a quick instruction on the activity itself and then you will have some opportunity as you can see here.

278
00:46:45,685 --> 00:47:01,285
It says make some notes, it really is creating a wall of affirmation for these lgbtq+ Elders that our nonprofit serves, and then we will take just a couple of minutes to get together and say what was that like What was your feeling?

279
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:05,885
What did you learn about yourself and about pride month working on this activity?

280
00:47:05,885 --> 00:47:09,885
So there's a lot to do a lot to learn and hopefully a lot of fun to be had.

281
00:47:10,085 --> 00:47:19,185
So let us start with those icebreakers as we celebrate love during pride month and this is, you can say is a bit of a trivia contest, and so I am going to start out.

282
00:47:19,185 --> 00:47:26,085
We're going to guess the rock star because we have musicians Among Us, who have really played a part in promoting queer culture.

283
00:47:26,085 --> 00:47:29,985
We're going to focus on one, and we're going to give you a pole here.

284
00:47:30,285 --> 00:47:32,285
Are you to guess now?

285
00:47:32,285 --> 00:47:35,385
This is one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music.

286
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:41,385
He was known for his flamboyant stage Persona and four octave vocal range.

287
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:42,385
Oh my goodness.

288
00:47:42,585 --> 00:47:46,385
I think this may have been a little too easy for you.

289
00:47:46,585 --> 00:47:51,485
I see that everybody has guessed correctly and again, you are right.

290
00:47:51,485 --> 00:47:54,185
This is indeed Freddie Mercury.

291
00:47:54,285 --> 00:48:00,085
Shown here when he appeared at Wembley Stadium, I believe that was a Live Aid concert.

292
00:48:00,185 --> 00:48:02,885
Look at him there and so sad that tragically.

293
00:48:02,885 --> 00:48:07,985
We lost him a little too early but good for you for knowing your pride trivia.

294
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:09,785
Now we're going to kind of switch gears here.

295
00:48:09,885 --> 00:48:13,285
This may be a little more challenging we're going to guess.

296
00:48:13,285 --> 00:48:22,185
There's many different Pride flags and each one kind of represents a different identity in our lgbtq+ community.

297
00:48:22,385 --> 00:48:25,385
So you have to match the flag to the community.

298
00:48:25,385 --> 00:48:26,985
So maybe this will be a little bit harder.

299
00:48:26,985 --> 00:48:28,985
It will see you seem like a smart Bunch.

300
00:48:28,985 --> 00:48:29,285
Okay.

301
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:29,985
Here's our first.

302
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:38,185
Like this is the more commonly known for a pride flag, so which identity goes with this pride flag.

303
00:48:39,685 --> 00:48:42,185
I don't know, I don't know if this is really that hard.

304
00:48:42,285 --> 00:48:44,485
I am going to give you a second to answer this one.

305
00:48:44,685 --> 00:48:45,285
What?

306
00:48:45,385 --> 00:48:48,385
What identity goes with this pride flag?

307
00:48:51,785 --> 00:48:54,185
I mean, you have to admit, some of these guesses are pretty fun.

308
00:48:54,385 --> 00:48:55,285
Oh, my goodness.

309
00:48:55,285 --> 00:48:55,685
Wow.

310
00:48:55,685 --> 00:48:57,585
I am so shocked that you got this one.

311
00:48:57,585 --> 00:48:58,285
Right.

312
00:48:58,385 --> 00:48:58,985
Very good.

313
00:48:58,985 --> 00:49:03,185
Yes, this is considered again, you got all got it, right?

314
00:49:03,185 --> 00:49:05,985
This of course, goes with the homosexual, orientation.

315
00:49:06,285 --> 00:49:08,585
And you have to admit, some of those choices were pretty fun.

316
00:49:08,785 --> 00:49:17,485
Okay, let us take a look at another flag now, that's why I may not be as well-known, but I think the answer, I think our hint is going to help you with the answer.

317
00:49:17,485 --> 00:49:18,685
Let us take a look.

318
00:49:18,685 --> 00:49:19,985
Guess the identity.

319
00:49:20,185 --> 00:49:27,785
That goes along with this flag that was designed in 1998, which identity goes along with this flag.

320
00:49:27,785 --> 00:49:31,985
Oh hey, we had a couple of, we have actually a little bit of dissension.

321
00:49:32,185 --> 00:49:41,185
This makes this more exciting for me but indeed those of you who guessed bisexual got it right now, so that's kind of new flag, isn't that?

322
00:49:41,185 --> 00:49:42,785
That was, that was a new one to me.

323
00:49:42,785 --> 00:49:43,485
So good job.

324
00:49:43,485 --> 00:49:46,785
Those of you who guessed bisexual, okay, I have got another one for you.

325
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:49,885
Here's another flag that was created for this.

326
00:49:50,085 --> 00:50:03,585
Immunity and again, introduce just a few years ago in 2018, so which Community go identifies with this flag and I think the colors are quite lovely.

327
00:50:04,685 --> 00:50:13,385
Okay again, so again we have a little bit of back and forth on this one, but for those of you who guessed lesbian, you are created correct.

328
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:23,385
So, again, whenever you go to a pride parade, you can look for that black, and here's our final flag of our trivia contest.

329
00:50:23,485 --> 00:50:31,185
Now, this is again, the, the origins of this flag are not known but it was introduced in the late 2000s.

330
00:50:32,485 --> 00:50:33,785
What flag?

331
00:50:33,985 --> 00:50:36,485
What community is this flag representing?

332
00:50:37,085 --> 00:50:37,285
Okay.

333
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:38,385
So ghetto, look at this.

334
00:50:38,385 --> 00:50:39,885
We have a 60/40 split.

335
00:50:39,885 --> 00:50:42,385
This is exciting who is right?

336
00:50:42,385 --> 00:50:47,285
And who is wrong, it is the straight Ally, okay.

337
00:50:47,285 --> 00:50:49,285
So again, I am so excited.

338
00:50:49,285 --> 00:50:55,485
There was a little bit of dissent there because I thought maybe our trivia game may have been a little too easy.

339
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:56,385
So excellent.

340
00:50:56,385 --> 00:50:58,085
Thank you so much for participating.

341
00:50:58,285 --> 00:51:01,685
Again, a lot of knowledge in our welcome room.

342
00:51:01,885 --> 00:51:03,885
So now I want to tell you a little bit about the nonprofit.

343
00:51:03,985 --> 00:51:09,985
Drop it that you're working for and because I don't know if everyone is familiar with degree out Circle again.

344
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:23,785
This is I want to tell you what, griot stands for its gay reunions and our time, and it's the only organization that's dedicated to serving the needs of the elders in the lgbtq+ people of color.

345
00:51:23,985 --> 00:51:33,885
And you can see that their mission is a great one there, just trying to eliminate all forms of Oppression, especially if you think about it, as I mentioned earlier, Elders, already deal.

346
00:51:33,985 --> 00:51:38,785
With ageism and racism and sexism and misogyny, and all these things.

347
00:51:38,785 --> 00:51:44,085
And then you, and then you include those of course, who are part of the lgbtq+ community.

348
00:51:44,285 --> 00:51:57,985
So they have to deal with a lot, and I am so happy that today, we can serve them by volunteering in this activity, so, I luckily, we have a video and that will tell you a little bit more about both the organization and the work they do.

349
00:51:58,185 --> 00:51:59,585
And we will play that for you now.

350
00:52:16,085 --> 00:52:24,085
Come a long way, but we still have not reached the top of the mountain as Martin Luther King, with Junior say.

351
00:52:45,185 --> 00:52:59,985
Sprint, older adults, especially LGBT, when we get above will be get up age, we sometimes become invisible, our issues become invisible, our challenges become on your dress.

352
00:53:00,485 --> 00:53:11,885
So we, the purpose of our organization is to put that visibility back on our community and to show, you know, communities at.

353
00:53:11,885 --> 00:53:29,685
Hey, not only are we still here, but we still have the same challenges that, you know, other individuals that have Grill single carry on in my life at a time.

354
00:53:29,685 --> 00:53:30,785
When I was really lonely.

355
00:53:30,885 --> 00:53:37,985
I was just watching TV and saw the thing on we're circling and can remember and it gave my life a purpose that I didn't have for a while.

356
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:29,685
So again such a worthy organization and these affirmation walls, these digital affirmation walls that you will be creating two are really again to just send out notes to this community these Elders to let them know that we are thinking about them that we understand.

357
00:54:29,685 --> 00:54:33,285
As you can see here, they face dual discrimination.

358
00:54:33,485 --> 00:54:39,485
And that we want to know that there are people out there that are supporting them and it's all of us collected here today.

359
00:54:39,685 --> 00:54:44,185
And, so I am so happy that you have the Community to take part in this activity.

360
00:54:44,485 --> 00:54:45,885
So how is this going to work?

361
00:54:45,885 --> 00:54:48,085
Because we want to make this as easy as possible.

362
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:52,385
Well, first of all, is to think about what you're writing and of course know your reader.

363
00:54:52,585 --> 00:55:00,385
So again just to remember these are elders and their lgbtq+ so they again that's important to know who your audience is.

364
00:55:00,685 --> 00:55:02,485
So you want to avoid any trigger words.

365
00:55:02,485 --> 00:55:11,385
And one of the first things you will notice is we called them Elders because there're many things that you can call people who are of a certain age that they do not appreciate it.

366
00:55:11,485 --> 00:55:12,785
Elder is one that we have found.

367
00:55:12,785 --> 00:55:22,885
That is it gives them the respect, they deserve without some of the negative connotation and then of course, we want to use the neutral pronouns, which is so important to this community.

368
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:28,885
So we want to use the, the appropriate pronouns so that we don't run into any triggers there as well.

369
00:55:30,085 --> 00:55:32,185
Now again this just reiterates.

370
00:55:32,185 --> 00:55:35,685
What I just said again, you want to make sure your language is sensitive.

371
00:55:35,685 --> 00:55:36,485
It's simple.

372
00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:37,485
It's supportive.

373
00:55:37,485 --> 00:55:37,985
It's warm.

374
00:55:37,985 --> 00:55:38,885
It's positive.

375
00:55:38,885 --> 00:55:40,585
This is an affirmation wall.

376
00:55:40,585 --> 00:55:44,485
So everything there should be positive upbeat and supportive.

377
00:55:44,985 --> 00:55:51,185
Now here, just some sample messages and I like these because they tend to be concise you see everything from.

378
00:55:51,285 --> 00:55:52,485
You know the very first one.

379
00:55:52,485 --> 00:55:54,685
I want to tell you that love has no gender.

380
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:56,385
Love is never wrong.

381
00:55:56,385 --> 00:55:58,985
You are more than your queer and gender identity.

382
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:03,285
All the way to the one at the bottom hope is never silent, right?

383
00:56:03,285 --> 00:56:09,385
So there's a, there're many things you can say that will make them feel seen and supported and loved.

384
00:56:09,385 --> 00:56:11,585
And that's what we really are going for today.

385
00:56:11,985 --> 00:56:21,485
Now, these are things, they recommend that you avoid, you can see again, they reiterate that you want to be positive but you don't want to be glib either.

386
00:56:21,485 --> 00:56:22,785
Like, don't worry, be happy.

387
00:56:22,785 --> 00:56:24,885
It's a little flip, a little glib.

388
00:56:24,985 --> 00:56:38,985
And also if you are an ally as I am, you don't want to say, I Understand what you're going through because as someone who is just shy of being an elder and who is an ally I don't, I can never understand what they have gone through.

389
00:56:39,185 --> 00:56:46,485
And so, you want to make sure you're supportive, but you don't try to grab their Journey as your own because none of us truly can grab.

390
00:56:46,585 --> 00:56:48,885
Can understand truly understand what they have gone through.

391
00:56:49,285 --> 00:56:51,085
So just make sure you're supportive.

392
00:56:51,485 --> 00:56:54,585
But, you know, don't try to appropriate what they have been through either.

393
00:56:55,585 --> 00:56:57,185
Now here are some basics do's and don'ts.

394
00:56:57,385 --> 00:57:05,585
Again, we ask that you avoid Any messages directly about religion or faith because again you don't know exactly who this is going to.

395
00:57:05,885 --> 00:57:09,085
Again we say positive and supportive but maybe the fourth or fifth time.

396
00:57:09,085 --> 00:57:15,485
I have said that and again try to keep them concise and short and you will see once my colleague dep.

397
00:57:15,485 --> 00:57:22,685
If he hasn't already in the chat window shares, the templates that were working with really, short messages are going to work really well.

398
00:57:23,185 --> 00:57:35,585
Now, another thing I want to mention in the template, you may see that we tried to make it as easy as possible for you to work on these, but you may feel like you want to add something to the designs, we have already given you.

399
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:41,885
You may want to add an image, but we want to make sure you don't run into problems with copyright sharing.

400
00:57:41,885 --> 00:57:43,085
Copyrighted images.

401
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:44,985
So these websites.

402
00:57:44,985 --> 00:57:49,685
And again, I will ask Debbie to share these in the, in the chat window as well.

403
00:57:49,685 --> 00:57:54,485
So you can refer to them is that these are all open source web sites.

404
00:57:54,485 --> 00:57:58,285
So anything you find on these websites, would be copyright free?

405
00:57:58,285 --> 00:58:02,385
So I just want to make sure You have your own list of these that you can reference.

406
00:58:02,385 --> 00:58:06,285
So you make sure that you don't run into any problems with potential copyright issues.

407
00:58:06,885 --> 00:58:08,685
Now again, how do we do this virtually?

408
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:15,485
Well again, we have developed a template, it is a slide deck and you can download it to your local computer.

409
00:58:15,585 --> 00:58:19,685
It should work with whatever slideshow program you prefer to use.

410
00:58:19,685 --> 00:58:25,485
You just download it locally, open it up, and each slide is its own little template, and you have a few to choose from.

411
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:34,285
So you pick the one that you like, and then you start adding Words, adding copyright free images and really think about remember your audience.

412
00:58:34,485 --> 00:58:39,185
They are Elders with elder eyes and even at my age, I have trouble reading.

413
00:58:39,185 --> 00:58:44,785
So you want to think about, I want to make the text I use as high contrast as possible.

414
00:58:44,885 --> 00:58:48,385
So, think about if the background is like, the text should be dark.

415
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:51,885
If conversely, if the background is dark, the text.

416
00:58:51,985 --> 00:58:58,885
I may have just said that, but you want to make sure that if you have a dark background, white text on a white background, dark text.

417
00:58:59,485 --> 00:59:00,985
Now, what does this look like in the end?

418
00:59:01,185 --> 00:59:02,785
Well here's a sample of the templates.

419
00:59:02,785 --> 00:59:03,585
One of the templates.

420
00:59:03,585 --> 00:59:04,385
You have three or four.

421
00:59:04,385 --> 00:59:05,385
I think to choose from.

422
00:59:05,485 --> 00:59:08,285
If you fill it in, boom, right?

423
00:59:08,285 --> 00:59:18,285
So you can add text, you can add copyright free images, you can see here, there's some of these are quotes, some of these are just, you know, little messages that were written themselves.

424
00:59:18,485 --> 00:59:21,285
So that's what your affirmation wall can look like.

425
00:59:23,385 --> 00:59:26,485
And then of course this is something we will also put in the chat window.

426
00:59:27,285 --> 00:59:31,385
You will want to name your affirmation wall which would be one slide.

427
00:59:31,385 --> 00:59:38,785
You would save that slide or wall individually named it you see here and then you will upload it to the link.

428
00:59:38,785 --> 00:59:45,985
And you can see here, you don't have to finish today because we know we're all going to have, you know, maybe less than 10 minutes to work on it.

429
00:59:46,085 --> 00:59:51,785
You can get started here, you have up to two weeks to complete this activity up to two weeks.

430
00:59:51,885 --> 00:59:54,185
So you can brainstorm Get started.

431
00:59:54,285 --> 01:00:00,285
And then after our sessions over today, you can finish and you can send it to us when you're ready, okay?

432
01:00:01,885 --> 01:00:07,085
And again, devil set will share this in the chat window where it will be a link that you can click.

433
01:00:08,285 --> 01:00:15,685
So, I want to start designing, I want to take a second though and see, if there are any questions that have come in and do our Q&A window, or Q&A panel.

434
01:00:15,985 --> 01:00:20,285
I don't see any right now, but if anything has come into the chat window as well.

435
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:29,485
I see all the information that Deb has shared which I appreciate but I want to see if anyone has any quick questions.

436
01:00:29,585 --> 01:00:41,485
What I would like to do is let us start designing, and we can spend probably the next seven or eight minutes designing, and then we can come back together and talk about it really, really quickly.

437
01:00:41,585 --> 01:01:01,485
Before we close our, today's session with, with Gina, I don't see any questions now but if you want to just start designing now and if any questions come up you can share them in the Q&A window or the chat window, I will be checking both, and then we will come back together.

438
01:01:01,485 --> 01:01:05,285
Like I said in about Seven minutes.

439
01:08:20,085 --> 01:08:21,685
Such a great exercise.

440
01:08:21,885 --> 01:08:22,885
Now, welcome back.

441
01:08:22,885 --> 01:08:23,585
Everybody.

442
01:08:23,585 --> 01:08:27,085
I am just really curious to see, I know this.

443
01:08:27,085 --> 01:08:43,285
That was a short period of time to work on our activity and some of you may have just gotten started or be halfway done, but I wondered in that in the chat window, if you could describe the process of working on your affirmation while in one or two words, how would you describe it?

444
01:08:43,785 --> 01:09:01,685
What was it, like, working on this affirmation wall for our lgbtq+ Elders at the, at the garrote Circle, what was it like You may still be working, you may still be in the middle of your PowerPoint slides going.

445
01:09:01,885 --> 01:09:02,885
Not now Carla.

446
01:09:02,885 --> 01:09:03,685
I am working.

447
01:09:04,685 --> 01:09:06,285
What was it like working on these?

448
01:09:09,385 --> 01:09:11,785
Enjoyable Janet says it says fun.

449
01:09:11,885 --> 01:09:14,185
That's you know that's exactly what I want to hear.

450
01:09:14,185 --> 01:09:16,085
That makes me happy Valerie.

451
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:17,285
I see that you mentioned.

452
01:09:17,285 --> 01:09:20,785
You're trying to work on your text boxes and PowerPoint.

453
01:09:21,085 --> 01:09:22,585
Yeah that can be sometimes.

454
01:09:23,484 --> 01:09:38,285
Yeah Janet see Janet is giving you a that's what I was happy to get some advice on that double clicking the text in the text box and I think that power points allows you to like rotate them and that way you will be able to get it in the box at that we provide in the template.

455
01:09:38,285 --> 01:09:41,585
So hopefully And it's Janet advice will help you.

456
01:09:41,984 --> 01:09:52,285
Yeah, we really want these to be enjoyable and fun and like I said, you have a couple of weeks to work on these, so I know that all of you are, probably if you're like me, you want it to be perfect.

457
01:09:52,984 --> 01:09:57,585
And I believe we might have someone that wants to share theirs.

458
01:09:57,585 --> 01:09:58,585
That's in process.

459
01:09:58,585 --> 01:10:00,385
Do we have someone that wants to share theirs?

460
01:10:00,885 --> 01:10:02,185
Look now here's one.

461
01:10:02,485 --> 01:10:05,585
This is actually, our producer Jessica was working on her.

462
01:10:05,585 --> 01:10:07,385
She really wanted to get hers going.

463
01:10:07,785 --> 01:10:08,785
This is amazing.

464
01:10:08,785 --> 01:10:08,985
Jess.

465
01:10:09,185 --> 01:10:11,985
Sakura, for such a short period of time.

466
01:10:12,385 --> 01:10:14,985
So she has love has no gender.

467
01:10:14,985 --> 01:10:15,585
You are loved.

468
01:10:15,585 --> 01:10:18,085
Just as you are thanked you for being you.

469
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:21,485
You're the reason why so many can be their true selves.

470
01:10:21,485 --> 01:10:26,085
Wow, that's amazing, I hate nothing about you and then thank you.

471
01:10:26,485 --> 01:10:29,185

472
01:10:29,185 --> 01:10:32,785
Wow a lot of I need to get, so I need to get some claps on that one.

473
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:39,785
So again, everyone out that if yours is still in process, keep working on it again, you have two weeks to go this.

474
01:10:40,085 --> 01:10:43,985
And all of the links that Deb provided will still be viable.

475
01:10:44,185 --> 01:10:46,385
It was such a pleasure working with you.

476
01:10:46,385 --> 01:10:52,585

And we're going to talk today about skills based coaching and how you know burnout is at its all-time high.

11
00:19:14,758 --> 00:19:35,558
As we know, and in fact, forty-seven point four million people voluntarily left their jobs in 2021, and we're finding that, you know, 78% of Industry professionals found that Group coaching could very well be extremely helpful during a lot of the Chan change management that we're all going through.

12
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:38,258
So I am excited to dive into this topic.

13
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:40,958
But before we do, so few housekeeping things to note.

14
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,258

21
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:13,058
My producer.

22
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:14,958
Could you throw up our poll?

23
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:18,558
We're going to start with this quick question here?

24
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:21,158
All right, let us get a pulse.

25
00:20:21,858 --> 00:20:24,258
Do you know what skills based coaching is?

26
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:28,058
So, go ahead and drop your votes in.

27
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:30,758

Okay, throwing those votes.

29
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:40,258
And then Jess if you want to reveal to us.

30
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:49,458
How many folks know what skills based coaching is, how many of you don't and it's okay if you don't because we're going to dive into that.

31
00:20:52,358 --> 00:20:53,258
All right.

32
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:54,458
Okay.

33
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:57,058
Well, I am not really seeing the results.

34
00:20:57,058 --> 00:20:58,258
Are you, are you got them up?

35
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:58,758

So, Gina is on the island in the Pacific.

51
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,358
I am gonna Iving in the Atlantic.

52
00:21:44,858 --> 00:21:49,658
So, my time is 1:00 PM Eastern, and I am on the opposite of an island.

53
00:21:49,658 --> 00:22:01,758
I am in the Prairies of Texas in Dallas, Texas, where there is nothing but flat land and nope, beautiful weather to be singing and it is 12:07 PM here.

54
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:10,058
Nice, I love that we can all tune in and be Completely different time zones like this and have such an amazing conversation together.

55
00:22:10,358 --> 00:22:13,758
So I am really excited to dive into this before we jump in.

56
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:21,858
Could each of you provide a quick little introduction of, you know what you're solving for today with your organization's?

57
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:24,258
What's top of mind, even?

58
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:26,958
Sure I am happy to go first.

59
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:32,658
So as you mentioned, I am the founder and CEO here at lingo live and at lingo live.

60

Our mission is to connect the world and Empower people to contribute their unique potential at work.

61
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:50,658
And so we do that by unlocking that potential through the transformative power of one-on-one coaching which I know we're going to talk a little bit about how we do that coaching skills based coaching.

62
00:22:50,658 --> 00:22:55,458
So I won't kind of ruin that surprised now but at a high level that's what we do.

63
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:58,658
Thanks, Tyler Roberto good.

64
00:22:58,758 --> 00:22:59,658
Fantastics yet.

65
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:01,858
My name is Roberto CEO.

66
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:03,358
Co-founder of welcome.

67
00:23:03,358 --> 00:23:05,958
Welcome is the platform that you're on, so welcome to welcome.

68
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:13,258
What we focus on is helping companies gather and Inspire their distributed Workforce right now.

69
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:16,458
More than ever before, folks are located around the world.

70
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:26,158
Hence, even the intro of this conversation and what we're doing is partnering with organizations that are driving more intentional, Gatherings across their employees.

71
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:36,058
Life cycle from onboarding to town halls to Learning and Development to social, diversity and Community groups as well on the platform.

72
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:38,458
So that's what we do on our side.

73
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:40,058
Awesome.

74
00:23:41,058 --> 00:23:41,858
Thanks for weirdo.

75
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,058
Okay.

76
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:57,758
So Doom Loop, you know that was part of our title here where we want to break this corporate Doom Loop, and I am just curious as in chat, have you all heard of this term ERM Doom Loop.

77
00:23:57,758 --> 00:24:00,058
If you have just, just let us know.

78
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:02,158
Because Tyler could you help?

79
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:06,358
Explain, you know, what is this Doom Loop cycle?

80
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:08,558
And why is it affecting?

81
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:09,658
Oh, no, not really.

82
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:11,258
Okay, Joe hasn't heard of it.

83
00:24:11,258 --> 00:24:13,758
And anyone else, if you have heard of it, let us know.

84
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:14,958
That's okay.

85
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:15,958
Joe, I hadn't heard of it.

86
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,458
Either until our marketing team, came up with it.

87
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:23,858
I thought it was a really brilliant way of putting it, which is so basically, what's the Doom Loop?

88
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:24,358
The Doom Loops.

89
00:24:24,358 --> 00:24:29,958
Is this idea that As you mentioned before the voluntary, turnover, that happens?

90
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,758
So, what's happening there?

91
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:33,158
Why are people leaving companies?

92
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:34,058
They're leaving companies?

93
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:38,158
Not because of their role or the company, they're leaving companies because of their boss.

94
00:24:38,158 --> 00:25:00,958
So three out of four employees who leave a company voluntarily, they do that because they basically have a bad manager and so what that leads to is you know obviously a cost and a drop in revenue for the organization which then prevents those companies from being able to invest in management, which then starts the cycle all over again.

95
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:06,258
So, that's the concept of the Doom Loop bad managers lead to Employees leaving, which drops Revenue hurts.

96
00:25:06,258 --> 00:25:09,958
Your cash, prevents you from being able to invest and improving those managers.

97
00:25:12,358 --> 00:25:13,058
Gotcha.

98
00:25:13,258 --> 00:25:14,958
Okay, I didn't know.

99
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:20,258
It was a marketing term that I thought it was actually like an industry term.

100
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:22,058
Well, I think it is, but I hadn't heard of it.

101
00:25:22,058 --> 00:25:25,358
I am saying to Joe like I, yeah, I hadn't heard of it.

102
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:26,458
Put that watch.

103
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,658
Uh, it totally makes sense.

104
00:25:28,858 --> 00:25:36,758
I mean, if you even layer on the post, pandemic burnout that everyone is experiencing those.

105
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:42,058
Managers may also be burnt out themselves And, you know, could result.

106
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:44,258
So, it's like, how do we come around?

107
00:25:44,258 --> 00:25:48,658
That manager is, is the big opportunity here, Rob?

108
00:25:48,658 --> 00:25:53,558
Did you have any other thoughts to know what you're seeing with doom loops?

109
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:58,058
And you know, the management eating this support?

110
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,058
Yeah, yeah, no doubt.

111
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:04,958
So yeah, Doom Loop was new to me as well, but it completely makes sense to describe.

112
00:26:05,258 --> 00:26:15,258
I think that cycle of like what's happening right now and I just now in the industry but for a long Time like folks are, you know, Sister pandemic.

113
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:16,858
People have just really started.

114
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:23,158
Taking inventory of the work, they do who they work with, we're doing work from.

115
00:26:24,158 --> 00:26:29,458
And in that inventory, they're making decisions to change, right?

116
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:39,458
Organizations that are not invested in those employee experiences and invested in the key managers who drive in pole experiences.

117
00:26:40,958 --> 00:27:06,758
A hard time, have a hard time retaining talent because of that, I think one of the things that we're going to find, and I am looking forward to this conversation, is the important of even middle managers, like folks that are in chat folks that are joining us as we were streaming here, managers are having to not just carry the weight of an organization because they understand sort of the mile markers that benchmarks of goals that they have to go ahead.

118
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:10,358
And then have to drive and coach your team to get there.

119
00:27:11,158 --> 00:27:16,458
But they were also dealing with employees that are going through hardships.

120
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:20,858
And over the last few years, it's been really hard for all of us.

121
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:21,458
Right?

122
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:27,358
Personally and professionally and even given the certain the current like market conditions.

123
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:31,458
There's a lot of thrashing.

124
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:45,858
I would say right now just at the employee level at company level and the middle manager that manager not just has to show up to get results and I have an outcome but also to show up in coach and drive culture for their team.

125
00:27:46,258 --> 00:27:56,858
And so that middle manager, I think if we had a focus of put a focus on people within a company middle managers are carrying a lot of weight today.

126
00:27:56,958 --> 00:28:02,658
And, so I am glad that were talking about how this, how do we support managers and Leaders with coaching?

127
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:04,658
What is this coaching actually lead to?

128
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:10,558
What kind of outcomes can actually drive for the organization and so yeah, I am looking forward to the combo.

129
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,458
Yeah, just to add to that Roberta.

130
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:16,358
I think it's really important to, to capture the scale of the problem.

131
00:28:16,358 --> 00:28:18,658
Like, I think everyone can buy into like yeah, that's an issue.

132
00:28:18,658 --> 00:28:19,558
We should solve it.

133
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:25,958
But you know, when Gina mentions the statistics around voluntary, turnover, this is last year alone.

134
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:27,058
It cost the US economy.

135
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:39,158
A trillion dollars, a trillion dollars wasted due to voluntary turnover because you have to spend money often times as much as 2 times the salary of the person who left.

136
00:28:39,158 --> 00:28:46,058
And so, if you're a company with 100 employees, He's the Bureau of Labor and statistics, going to say, you're going to lose, 26 of those employees.

137
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,358
Every year.

138
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:52,258
That's 2.6 million dollars that you're paying as an organization to replace those employees.

139
00:28:52,258 --> 00:29:01,358
Like, most of us that are working at companies with 100 people, you can't afford to spend 2.6 million dollars so it is a very big, you know, national issue.

140
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:06,258
So let us jump into skills based coaching.

141
00:29:06,758 --> 00:29:09,558
How is that different from regular coaching?

142
00:29:09,658 --> 00:29:12,858
You know, I think there's, like General coaching that people are aware of.

143
00:29:12,858 --> 00:29:17,358
But when it comes to skills based coaching, how do you define that Tyler?

144
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:23,758
And how do we see that as possibly a huge solution to some of these problems were talking about?

145
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:30,458
Yeah, so basically you know the way that companies are solving this problem which will get into like dif what is skills based coaching.

146
00:29:30,858 --> 00:29:36,358
So companies acknowledge this issue trillion dollars And so the way that they're solving it is their Learning and Development.

147
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:39,158
Teams are putting together training programs to say.

148
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:46,858
Okay when we have got to upscale our managers let us figure out what skills really matter to be a leader at lingo live or welcome.

149
00:29:46,858 --> 00:29:54,658
Like what does that mean, leading effectively at this company, so they codify some skills that they want to focus on, and then they train their managers on those skills.

150
00:29:55,258 --> 00:30:00,358
And usually that happens in like a group setting where it's kind of like instructor-led training.

151
00:30:00,658 --> 00:30:04,558
Maybe there's some coaching circles where people kind of Share what they thought about.

152
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:22,558
But unless you can provide the kind of safe space for someone to work out what these things mean for them and how they can actually embody these skills, you're not going to see meaningful Behavior change, you're going to get people who is a kind of learn some things, and they keep it in the back of their head.

153
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:24,158
But they're not really embodying this.

154
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:29,758
So, if you think about a skill like having difficult conversations, that's like such a classic skill.

155
00:30:30,658 --> 00:30:41,958
You can run a training around crucial Relations you can train people on Frameworks for things like Behavior and the impact of that behavior and then asking someone a question, right?

156
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:54,058
Like you can give them these Concepts but unless you provide the environment for them to be able to practice those things and really contextualize, what does this mean for me in my job?

157
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:55,558
And who I am as a person?

158
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:59,458
It's not going to become ingrained and how they show up.

159
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:05,358
And so that's what skills based coaching is, is the idea of Partnering with you as an organization to identify?

160
00:31:05,358 --> 00:31:13,158
What are the skills that you're training these leaders on and giving you what, you don't have the scale to be able to provide, which is personalized coaching.

161
00:31:13,358 --> 00:31:15,158
It's catered to those skills.

162
00:31:15,158 --> 00:31:20,658
So that these folks can actually contextualize them and start to embody them as a regular part of their identity as a leader.

163
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:28,858
And how that's different from traditional coaching is a little bit more open-ended, where it's kind of like you.

164
00:31:28,858 --> 00:31:32,458
Every single individual might be working on their own things.

165
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:36,558
You show up when you need the coach, you kind of talk about what's top of Mind.

166
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:44,258
Our skills based coaching is very much focused on a specific goal that you're trying to tackle skills that matter to your organization.

167
00:31:44,258 --> 00:31:50,958
That's going to help you achieve that goal in the accountability that we put in place through our applied learning model to make sure that you're actually applying.

168
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:52,358
Things in the workplace.

169
00:31:54,358 --> 00:31:55,658
That's really good.

170
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:58,658
Thank you for waiting, Tyler.

171
00:31:58,658 --> 00:32:00,658
I just want to hit on the last point you mentioned.

172
00:32:00,658 --> 00:32:06,358
There are around accountability, how many of us get something done?

173
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:09,258
When there's a deadline most of us do, right?

174
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:17,458
Or we have to show up to a meeting and present something because somebody is expecting that you're going to have something done by a certain point in time.

175
00:32:17,758 --> 00:32:22,958
I think one of the most powerful things about coaching is the accountability that comes with that, right?

176
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:23,958
Not just like meeting.

177
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:38,158
One mapping out the gaps to go work on but and then it's like, hey, in two weeks, we're going to huddle up again for 30 minutes, and we should review that plan which will review that strategy we should check on the progress that you're making.

178
00:32:38,658 --> 00:32:54,058
I mean, I think that even Beyond managers even like employees, everyone that's listening to the call here, like there is something to be said around just accountability in general and mapping out the gaps that we want to go with.

179
00:32:54,158 --> 00:32:57,158
Steve individually right at work or in life.

180
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:04,258
And I always found that accountability when it comes to coaching is one of those key is one of the most part.

181
00:33:04,258 --> 00:33:05,658
Most powerful things about that.

182
00:33:05,658 --> 00:33:09,958
Dynamic, within coach is, hey, we're in this relationship.

183
00:33:10,358 --> 00:33:11,258
I am here to learn.

184
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:17,158
I am here to grow, your helping me, figure this stuff out, but also you're holding me accountable to get those things done.

185
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:23,358
Which, which I think is a big part of the how, how do you see that play out, you know, in the work that you're doing?

186
00:33:23,358 --> 00:33:24,058
How important?

187
00:33:24,158 --> 00:33:27,158
Is not an ability that can you just like set it goes?

188
00:33:27,158 --> 00:33:28,558
And it's kind of, leave it lofty.

189
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:33,358
And how effective is it when you actually have the follow-ups with someone on the team?

190
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:44,358
Yeah, so we have actually caught a fide that as a part of our learning methodology, in a part of our program, you're going to meet with your coach, you're going to work on some skills, like, again, it's a difficult conversation.

191
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:47,158
Maybe your company train, you on some Frameworks.

192
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:53,058
But now you have literally got a difficult conversation tomorrow Friday with one of your car for two weeks.

193
00:33:53,258 --> 00:34:02,558
Yeah, right, you're going To practice this thing with your coach, but then what we have codified is like homework in our program is an action step where the coach is going to say, Tyler.

194
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:13,058
We practice this, you know, we noticed how your imposter syndrome flares up when you're in this situation, take note of that, that's your homework between now.

195
00:34:13,058 --> 00:34:23,558
And next week, when we meet next Thursday, I want you to take note of like when that imposter syndrome flares up, I want you to write that down and next Thursday, when we meet, I am going to ask you about that.

196
00:34:23,558 --> 00:34:27,858
So that gets Put into the system, you get that as an email, as a homework assignment basically.

197
00:34:28,058 --> 00:34:33,257
And then when you start your session with your coach, the next week, they're going to check in on that and be like hey did you do that thing?

198
00:34:33,558 --> 00:34:33,958
What was that?

199
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:44,158
Like so that's where we're trying to use technology to kind of codify what the accountability is that you need to own and empower the coach to remember like oh yeah, because they have many coaches.

200
00:34:44,158 --> 00:34:46,658
He's like, oh yeah this is what Tyler's working on.

201
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,458
I am going to hold them accountable for this.

202
00:34:50,257 --> 00:35:00,158
Can you sort of break down the process of even how you would go about, to start a skills-based coaching program?

203
00:35:00,158 --> 00:35:08,458
If you will with a manager like, how does that the goal from the goal setting to the accountability that you're describing?

204
00:35:09,058 --> 00:35:10,958
Can you just walk us through some of those phases?

205
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:11,958
Sure.

206
00:35:12,558 --> 00:35:18,558
So the first phase is working with your organization to really understand what are the skills that you're training your leaders on.

207
00:35:18,558 --> 00:35:24,058
And why what are the There's their showing up in your organization today that you don't like what are the behaviors?

208
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:25,358
Give us some examples of that.

209
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:26,558
Like what is that?

210
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,658
Yeah, looks like common example.

211
00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:38,958
Common example we hear is hey we're growing 40 percent year over year, and so we're promoting a lot of people in the management who don't have experience in management.

212
00:35:39,158 --> 00:35:57,258
So a lot of the behaviors are showing up, are you know, they're nice, they're really nice to their team, but they're not really good at holding them accountable to Performance and outcomes, or they're telling their team what to do instead of coaching and developing them to allow the team to figure out what do they need to do.

213
00:35:57,558 --> 00:36:07,058
And so we do that kind of alignment at the organization level to understand some of the themes and the trends and create a custom coaching program that's going to address those themes.

214
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:24,358
But then what happens for the manager when they on board is we have 20 different leadership skills in our catalog that we built with leading experts on leadership development and you go through that and start to indicate what do Thinker some of my biggest strengths and then some of my biggest growth opportunities.

215
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:33,258
And then we also asked you to ask your team, so you send a survey to your manager and your direct reports in your peers to do the same thing.

216
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:39,058
So that you get this holistic perspective of how people see you as a leader, both strengths and weaknesses.

217
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:42,558
And that's great context for when you connect to a coach.

218
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:47,958
So obviously, we have a matching algorithm, you can find a coach that aligns with your availability in your skills.

219
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:59,558
But when you meet with that coach, they have got This context, not just from you but from your team around kind of what do, what do you and your team, feel your strong at and what our growth opportunities so that you can kind of talk through that.

220
00:36:59,858 --> 00:37:05,558
And then set a very specific goal that for you is going to be meaningful in the next four to six weeks.

221
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:07,858
I will pause there.

222
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,558
I mean that's just scratching the surface, but does that make sense?

223
00:37:10,558 --> 00:37:13,458
Like how we get kind of program launched in the managers?

224
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:14,558
On-boarded, with a coach?

225
00:37:15,058 --> 00:37:18,358
That's really great and to hear that you have identified.

226
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:24,158
You said 20 different common management, themes, what are some of those examples?

227
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:26,758
Yes, a we categorize these.

228
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:28,858
And by the way, I would be happy to share these.

229
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:35,958
Like, for any managers that are on this call that want to figure out how to improve their own self-awareness, which I know.

230
00:37:36,058 --> 00:37:37,058
No, you're big on.

231
00:37:37,058 --> 00:37:38,458
We're probably going to talk about.

232
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:40,758
We're happy to share our skills catalog.

233
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:49,658
Which I think as a manager one of the best things you can do is that exact same process where you survey your teammates and your manager to find out.

234
00:37:49,758 --> 00:37:51,558
Hey, here's these 20 leadership skills.

235
00:37:51,658 --> 00:37:54,158
What do you think I am strong at and what our growth opportunities?

236
00:37:54,558 --> 00:37:57,258
I think that's something that is hugely impactful for you.

237
00:37:57,258 --> 00:38:05,058
It just really turning the lights on outside of how you perceive yourself and kind of how your team perceives yourself.

238
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:10,858
But the skills themselves, I won't go into all 20, but there's basically five categories of skills.

239
00:38:11,558 --> 00:38:25,158
The first is communication skills, so things like active listening, I mentioned before managers are telling your team what to do instead of coaching them stop talking, ask questions and really actively, listen to what the answers are.

240
00:38:25,158 --> 00:38:29,258
And why this person saying that the second category is emotional intelligence.

241
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:38,058
So, being open is an example of a skill in emotional intelligence, being curious, being empathetic, like, Our emotional intelligence skills.

242
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:43,058
Probably the most important category, to be honest, the third is people skills.

243
00:38:43,158 --> 00:38:49,458
So having difficult conversations, is this skill in the people skills, the fourth is performance.

244
00:38:49,758 --> 00:39:01,858
So ensuring accountability or planning and directing work is an example of skills in the performance category and then the last is thought, like actual critical, thinking stop so much time.

245
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:04,658
We spend so much time, just working banging on keyboards or opening.

246
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:15,858
Google Docs responding to It was like, you need to think you need to set aside some time if you're really in a leadership position to stop doing and start thinking about kind of what is it that you need to be doing.

247
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:18,358
So, those are the five categories of skills.

248
00:39:18,758 --> 00:39:19,658
That's great.

249
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:23,458
I just dropped it in chat as well, and we would love to see that catalog.

250
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:30,058
So if somebody could drop that in chat, or we will have a post-event follow-up email, so we could drop the link in there as well.

251
00:39:30,558 --> 00:39:32,658
Perfect, that's great.

252
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:33,758
Rob.

253
00:39:33,758 --> 00:39:38,558
Did you have anything to add I am just taking notes over here now.

254
00:39:38,558 --> 00:39:40,158
It's all right, it's just stuff.

255
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:55,958
I think, I think one of those, you know, when we talk about Communication in general and I think, when you think about perform, all of them, all five of those, you know, for a manager to be able to show up and say, like, how am I successful?

256
00:39:56,058 --> 00:39:58,958
Like, how like my role as a manager?

257
00:39:59,658 --> 00:40:00,758
What does success look like?

258
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:06,558
And a lot of times, you know, we get caught up in the attic, Tyler you mentioned As well.

259
00:40:06,558 --> 00:40:10,858
It's like, well, I want to drive culture, which is amazing.

260
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:13,958
That's a, that's a big priority for team at the team level.

261
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:17,958
Make sure that there's a healthy Dynamic within, within a team within your team.

262
00:40:19,058 --> 00:40:34,058
But then I think performance is one of those things where if we're not really clear on the expectations of what an employee success looks like, then it's hard to actually see progression and have good conversations and feedback around those things, right?

263
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:37,258
It's something that For me, it's like one of those things.

264
00:40:37,258 --> 00:40:46,058
Like when you're running so fast, You intentionally are because you're running so fast.

265
00:40:46,058 --> 00:40:53,458
You intensively dismiss the importance of sitting down and check it in and asking the questions of how are you doing?

266
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:54,658
Are you be clear?

267
00:40:54,758 --> 00:40:57,658
Do you understand what we are expecting XYZ?

268
00:40:57,658 --> 00:41:02,158
Because sometimes, you're running so fast and high growth company that you take those things for granted.

269
00:41:02,158 --> 00:41:09,658
And as a manager, you might think that's okay, but at the employee level, they're craving, that they're craving.

270
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:14,158
That level of feedback, you're craving that level of clarity, they're craving.

271
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:20,758
Even the growth that comes from the performance that the output that they're having.

272
00:41:20,858 --> 00:41:23,258
What does that look like for me a year or two years?

273
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:27,558
Three years and a lot of times we're so caught up back to your point.

274
00:41:27,558 --> 00:41:39,558
Tyler, we're so focused in the now that we don't take a step back not just on the Strategic level, but also just on the manager level and checking in on our people, to make sure that they're good right across all.

275
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:40,958
Those spectrums.

276
00:41:41,058 --> 00:41:43,058
And so, yeah, I will put it on my side.

277
00:41:43,058 --> 00:41:49,458
I am just like taking notes on my side so, you can we yeah, like, taking mental notes here.

278
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,758
I will probably watch this recording over and over again.

279
00:41:54,158 --> 00:41:54,558
That's right.

280
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:57,858
It's really hard work like for anybody.

281
00:41:57,858 --> 00:42:02,958
That's like okay, it's easier said than done like I am with you, I run a company that does this and I struggle with it.

282
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:23,158
So, like to be clear, it's not like, okay, cool, there're some skills, you just need to like work on those skills and then you're good like know, you spend your whole life trying to get better at these things because we're not hardwired as human beings to do things like the naturally inquisitive or to, you know, not view a threat when there's just conflict.

283
00:42:23,258 --> 00:42:26,558
And it could be healthy conflict but you perceive it as a threat like we are.

284
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:28,458
We are not hired are hard wired this way.

285
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:48,958
And so you have got to work on it and you got to be patient with it and know that it's a marathon, not a Sprint and view success as the progress that you make, not as being this like Exemplar leader that, you know, everybody looks up to because it just it's going to take forever to get there and that's okay, it's either one thing just to follow up on that.

286
00:42:49,058 --> 00:42:53,158
Like, if we go back to tough conversations, that was an example.

287
00:42:53,258 --> 00:42:53,758
For that.

288
00:42:53,758 --> 00:43:06,558
You put forward managers and leaders always have to have tough conversations, no doubt, and then any employee on the other side is trying to make sense of those conversations as well.

289
00:43:06,858 --> 00:43:23,858
What are some, some key things that some folks can if someone is having tough conversation next week, Both from a manager perspective and also from employee perspective, what is a healthy structure or dynamic to go into those tough conversations with?

290
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:28,858
Well, I think the biggest thing is self-awareness like how are you doing?

291
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:38,658
As you go into that conversation as a manager as an employee whatever, self-awareness in terms of understanding the energy that you're coming in with.

292
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:41,458
So I am a, I am a big fan of meditation and mindfulness.

293
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:48,658
I think that's really powerful and helping you kind of tap into what's going on internally with me and you can do that for five minutes before.

294
00:43:48,858 --> 00:43:56,758
One on one, we're about to have that conversation, just put away the slack, close the laptop, breathe for five minutes and just kind of take stock of where you're at.

295
00:43:56,858 --> 00:43:58,658
I think that's super important.

296
00:43:59,158 --> 00:44:05,658
The other thing is then to, when you're delivering feedback, I mentioned this before.

297
00:44:05,658 --> 00:44:09,458
There's a framework, and we have partnered with the team at Life Labs learning.

298
00:44:09,758 --> 00:44:19,158
They kind of launched this framework that I think is really helpful, which is behavior impact and then a question biq.

299
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:23,058
So, here's a behavior, I noticed.

300
00:44:23,258 --> 00:44:37,158
Here's the impact, That had and then a question that you asked them, so an example of that could be and it can't be a you know, subjective thing and has to be like an actual thing that happened in a meeting.

301
00:44:37,158 --> 00:44:47,858
So in a meeting I noticed that you cut off Roberto think the impact of that is that he felt like his input wasn't very warranted.

302
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:49,258
How does that make you feel?

303
00:44:49,258 --> 00:44:50,458
Hearing that feedback for me?

304
00:44:50,458 --> 00:45:01,958
That's Behavior impact question and I think the questions probably the most important part because you're opening the door to the fact that like, this is my perception.

305
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:03,158
It's not a fact.

306
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:07,258
It's not like stamping you with this and you are bad, and I am good.

307
00:45:07,258 --> 00:45:13,458
It's like I am it's my job as your manager to give you feedback but at the same time I am open to hearing your reaction and your thoughts on this.

308
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:16,158
I think questions really important figuring out.

309
00:45:16,258 --> 00:45:17,558
However, you're going to say it.

310
00:45:17,558 --> 00:45:24,058
Make sure your objective and then make sure you end with a question instead of a definitive statement.

311
00:45:24,058 --> 00:45:29,558
So that you Make the other person feel free to kind of share how they feel and what their reaction is to it.

312
00:45:31,258 --> 00:45:32,658
That's good, that's really good.

313
00:45:33,158 --> 00:45:34,458
I like that quite a bit.

314
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:35,858
It's one of those things.

315
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:42,958
If you don't have a framework, you go into those conversations and, you know, it can get personal really fast.

316
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:47,558
We're both for you, and the individual versus I am being focused on.

317
00:45:47,558 --> 00:45:50,358
Hey, this happened to this is the impact.

318
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:51,958
Let us have a conversation around it.

319
00:45:52,358 --> 00:46:00,658
It removes the person personally from it, but the actual thing that happened, right, right.

320
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:11,358
But what you just touch on Roberto, I think is really important, just because you prepared and you got Mindful and you followed that framework doesn't mean that things aren't going to go off the rails.

321
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:13,458
They totally can and it can be emotional.

322
00:46:13,758 --> 00:46:20,758
And, so I think that's important too is to when if and when that happens be comfortable to saying hey let us pause here.

323
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:24,558
Like this is not right, we're not heading in a healthy direction and that's okay.

324
00:46:24,858 --> 00:46:28,758
Let us pause, let us just kind of, you know, leave it for later.

325
00:46:28,758 --> 00:46:30,158
Let us come back and revisit this.

326
00:46:30,658 --> 00:46:33,358
But I think, you know, let us move on to the next topic.

327
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:33,958
That's okay.

328
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:38,458
We don't need to get into this kind of back and forth where it's starting to get toxic.

329
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:44,258
I think that's another key part of being aware of That's good.

330
00:46:45,158 --> 00:46:49,658
If anybody has questions again, feel free to drop them in the Q&A tab as well.

331
00:46:49,758 --> 00:46:52,058
Y'all have never been in these situations, right Roberto?

332
00:46:55,258 --> 00:46:58,658
Yeah.

333
00:46:58,858 --> 00:46:59,558
No it's real.

334
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:00,458
It's real.

335
00:47:01,158 --> 00:47:14,958
I think that self-awareness point is really good and at as managers How can we improve in making sure to take that inventory?

336
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:24,158
Pulse check of where we are at, as we're running really fast with the things that need to get done and driving on performance so on and so forth.

337
00:47:24,158 --> 00:47:39,258
Not only for our teams of for ourselves everything that Roberto had described earlier, the pressures that have manager could be experiencing how do you have any Frameworks or any ways that a manager could just like paws?

338
00:47:39,558 --> 00:47:41,858
And take a self-awareness inventory.

339
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:47,858
Check You want me to tackle this one Roberto or I mean?

340
00:47:48,258 --> 00:47:50,058
Yeah, I will follow on from you.

341
00:47:50,058 --> 00:47:52,158
Just, I don't have all the answers here.

342
00:47:52,158 --> 00:47:57,258
I just know that, you know, for me, it's, it's really interesting, right?

343
00:47:57,258 --> 00:48:05,558
So if we look, if I look back at my career right, working as an individual contributor for a long time, then stepping into manager Rose.

344
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:12,358
And then now running a company like thinks changes at every step of that Journey quite a bit right.

345
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:18,558
But I think the going back to the self-awareness Gina you teed it up in?

346
00:48:18,558 --> 00:48:18,858
Tyler.

347
00:48:18,858 --> 00:48:39,358
We talked about this before, I think it's really and also just considering personal versus professional, I think we take inventory and say, look, if I am growing, as a manager, if I am trying to drive my career in this way and grow, that means that I my responsibilities are going to drive different skills that are required.

348
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:48,558
You know, one of my mentors said, hey, you know, a company can be growing exponentially like this far enough to the right, but people don't grow that way.

349
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:51,258
People don't grow that way at that speed.

350
00:48:51,258 --> 00:48:53,258
Is much more gradual, right?

351
00:48:53,258 --> 00:49:02,858
And so there's going to be a gap of like, hey my job or this season that we're in the, the company, the organization is requiring.

352
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:03,958
This I am here.

353
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:10,058
Now, self-awareness is saying there are some gaps between here and getting to this point of wearing.

354
00:49:10,258 --> 00:49:11,158
To be functioning.

355
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:12,658
How do I fill that Gap?

356
00:49:12,858 --> 00:49:18,958
But if we don't take inventory and say what is like, what are those gaps going back to self-awareness?

357
00:49:19,158 --> 00:49:40,058
That we're going to continue to be here where the need is up here and that's a problem that's where conflicts in because at that point now it's like well you know my team needs me to be much more clear about performance objectives, feedback Cycles, all these different things because we're running at the speed and this is what it's required.

358
00:49:40,158 --> 00:49:47,458
Word versus where we were a year ago, two years ago, three years ago and that's how I think about it.

359
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:55,158
When it comes to self-awareness is like, okay, if I am growing and developing, my responsibilities are going as well with that.

360
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:58,758
What are the gaps in order to keep up with the responsibilities that I have?

361
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:00,758
So that I can drive the right outcomes.

362
00:50:00,758 --> 00:50:03,758
I just for the organization, but from my team as well.

363
00:50:04,158 --> 00:50:09,858
And if we don't do that, then I think it takes an ever toll on ourselves because we can feel there's a gap.

364
00:50:10,658 --> 00:50:15,658
But if we're not stopping to address the Gap, we're just continuing every single day.

365
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:19,958
Carrying the weight of that Gap with that Gap.

366
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:23,858
Brings to not just your team for yourself and the company that you're working.

367
00:50:23,858 --> 00:50:31,458
Like so that's what I think about when I think about self-awareness is like there is a lot of times you're just gaps that we're not aware of.

368
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:32,358
We might feel it.

369
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:38,958
Our managers might tell us about it, our employees, my signal it, but we don't stop and take inventory.

370
00:50:39,158 --> 00:50:40,058
Then we can't fill the gap.

371
00:50:40,858 --> 00:50:47,758
They might signal it, but they probably won't like that's again then we're not as human beings wired that way.

372
00:50:47,758 --> 00:50:58,658
And, so I think vulnerability is which gets talked about a lot and I think a lot of times people can hear vulnerability and think it's this kind of woo thing where you're going to be holding hands singing Kumbaya frying.

373
00:50:58,658 --> 00:51:11,158
I know vulnerability is like what I said like, Sending out a survey to your people and saying, hey, there's these leadership skills that I think are good embodiment of what a leader is.

374
00:51:11,158 --> 00:51:20,958
Can you share with me things that you think I do well and things that I could do a better job at like that's huge is to open that door 20, I am allowed to do that.

375
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:24,058
Like not only are you allowed to like, I need that to become a better leader.

376
00:51:24,058 --> 00:51:25,258
I need your input.

377
00:51:25,558 --> 00:51:32,458
That is huge, but I think the bigger thing is that kind of what you're talking about, Roberto like that.

378
00:51:32,658 --> 00:51:37,658
Duration that self-exploration and I think you need another human being to help you do that.

379
00:51:37,658 --> 00:51:41,258
Obviously, I am biased like a coat as a guy who built a coaching company.

380
00:51:41,258 --> 00:51:53,358
Like I think someone who has a vested interest in helping you figure out what these things mean for you, and how you show up and why you show up that way, is really, really important.

381
00:51:53,358 --> 00:52:01,658
And so coaches can be really impactful there, but if you can't get a coach, like, you know, you can work with those employees to say, Hey, you gave me this feedback.

382
00:52:01,658 --> 00:52:02,558
I really would love your help.

383
00:52:02,658 --> 00:52:04,458
Help like what are you seeing show up?

384
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:11,658
When you say I need to get better at you know being open let us say like can you share more about how am I showing up?

385
00:52:11,658 --> 00:52:15,258
Can you give instances this week and then shut up?

386
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:19,158
Do not try to defend it, do not try to explain why you did the thing, right?

387
00:52:19,158 --> 00:52:25,158
Like just ask questions understand what they think that's going to help you build your self awareness.

388
00:52:25,158 --> 00:52:30,158
Your goal is not to solve problems and help people really understand where you came from.

389
00:52:30,158 --> 00:52:31,558
Or what your intent was.

390
00:52:31,558 --> 00:52:36,758
Your goal is to In the impact of your behaviors and your actions, both positive and negative.

391
00:52:36,758 --> 00:52:44,858
So I think if you can kind of Orient, Orient yourself around that is like understanding not explaining or problem-solving, you're going to be in a good spot.

392
00:52:46,658 --> 00:52:48,358
I think that's key right there in Joe.

393
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:58,658
I see that you're also reinforcing Tyler that's like right on, you know, after the question it's like you can't come in with a solution already.

394
00:52:59,158 --> 00:53:09,058
You have to literally just, listen and Like you said, shut up and let the employee share, that honest, feedback.

395
00:53:09,158 --> 00:53:16,658
Sarah Brown is asking, what are some other examples of questions in your framework?

396
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:21,058
I mean I think it really depends on the scenario.

397
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:32,158
So my cinerea was like where someone you know, interrupted someone else during a meeting which I think is that example that I have heard before, but I will try and think of it.

398
00:53:32,558 --> 00:53:41,758
Another example, a question could be, I would say if you sense that the person is, you should, you know, speaking of self-awareness, be aware of, like, how is this Landing?

399
00:53:41,758 --> 00:53:44,958
When I talk about the behavior in the impact?

400
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:50,858
Do I feel like this person is kind of leaning in And if they are, then the question could be something?

401
00:53:50,858 --> 00:53:53,958
Like where do you think that comes from right?

402
00:53:54,558 --> 00:53:56,658
Like, why did you feel the need to do that?

403
00:53:56,658 --> 00:53:58,458
Where do you think that comes from versus?

404
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:06,158
If you feel like their like, you know, getting their knife out then it's like a question might be, you know, how's that Landing?

405
00:54:06,158 --> 00:54:10,058
When you hear me say that or what's your perspective on the situation?

406
00:54:10,058 --> 00:54:12,758
Because I know, I am only giving part of the story.

407
00:54:12,758 --> 00:54:14,558
I would love to hear your perspective on it.

408
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:18,158
That's great.

409
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:20,558
Okay, looks like we have a question from Sal.

410
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:27,658
Jessica, if you don't mind pulling that on stage, what are some actual steps practices?

411
00:54:27,658 --> 00:54:33,758
One can take to improve empathy and general and workspace in specific?

412
00:54:37,458 --> 00:54:44,358
Yeah, I mean I think with empathy this has been a battle for me personally and professionally like I am somebody who is a problem.

413
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:47,158
Solver, I am kind of in a way a classic entrepreneur.

414
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,158
Like you give me a challenge.

415
00:54:48,158 --> 00:54:50,258
I am going to figure out how to solve that challenge.

416
00:54:50,258 --> 00:54:50,958
You give me a fire.

417
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,158
I am going to put it out or help.

418
00:54:53,158 --> 00:54:54,958
Get the team together to put it out.

419
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:58,158
And, so I think acknowledging that's not always your job.

420
00:54:58,158 --> 00:55:18,858
And Bethy is about just, I heard this quote, I apparently the Dalai Lama put it Sways is the difference between compassion and empathy is if you're on a hike and you see a man trapped under a boulder feeling their pain, right?

421
00:55:19,058 --> 00:55:22,058
Versus compassion is getting the boulder off of them.

422
00:55:22,258 --> 00:55:41,958
You know, it's like feeling their pain but at the same time, like solving the problem, and so I think understanding when you need to use each of those because sometimes they don't need their problem to be solved, sometimes they need to be heard, and they need to They need you to feel their pain with them but sometimes it's like, hey, this is not healthy for you or the organization.

423
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,758
So I am going to feel you.

424
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:51,158
I understand why this is, you know, painful but also let us get the boulder off you and let us figure out how we solve this problem.

425
00:55:51,158 --> 00:55:57,258
And so, I think figuring out which one is which comes down to trust and building a really solid relationship.

426
00:55:57,258 --> 00:56:04,458
Where, you know, this person and you kind of understand what they need, which is your job as a manager, like your job.

427
00:56:04,858 --> 00:56:09,558
To get better outcomes from a group of people working together.

428
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:12,458
That's, I have literally was looking at this today.

429
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:15,058
If y'all haven't read this book, The Making of a manager.

430
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:18,358
Yes, Julie's book, yes, Julie's book.

431
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:20,258
This is fantastic and she defines a manager.

432
00:56:20,258 --> 00:56:39,458
That way your job is to get better outcomes out of a group of people working together and you can't do that if you don't understand these people and who they are and what they need when it comes to kind of empathy versus Passion in the different circumstances that they face until you got to get to know them as people.

433
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:44,258
You can't just view your job is showing up getting status updates, telling them what they need to do.

434
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:50,758
And then ending you have gotta like cultivate a relationship understand what their biggest challenges are, why are they facing those challenges?

435
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:52,658
And then you will be able to figure out.

436
00:56:52,658 --> 00:56:57,758
Does this person need me to get under the boulder with them or do they need me to get the boulder off?

437
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:04,158
That's a really good distinction between empathy and compassion.

438
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:07,158
Kareem is actually making an interesting point there.

439
00:57:07,158 --> 00:57:18,258
The mere fact of asking rather than telling, and listening is a first step to building empathy, you know, making it about that other person and not about yourself.

440
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:24,958
So I think there's some great points, shared awesome.

441
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:27,458
So we were talking about that process.

442
00:57:27,658 --> 00:57:28,758
I would love to jump back.

443
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:30,358
Into, you know.

444
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:39,358
Now once we identify okay these are the goals and these are the things that we can improve on and the coaches identify to work with the manager.

445
00:57:39,658 --> 00:57:42,758
Now, what does that look like in accountability?

446
00:57:43,158 --> 00:57:43,558
Hmm.

447
00:57:44,258 --> 00:57:45,058
What is?

448
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:51,258
And today, let us say for those of us that are here, we don't have a coach, right?

449
00:57:51,658 --> 00:57:55,558
And let us say we need to solve these problems today.

450
00:57:55,758 --> 00:57:58,658
So what are some real practical things?

451
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:05,758
That we can do today to start, you know, you have helped us understand the identification process.

452
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:10,758
The self-awareness and vulnerability requires to ask the right questions.

453
00:58:10,758 --> 00:58:11,558
Get the feedback.

454
00:58:11,558 --> 00:58:13,458
Now how about accountability?

455
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:13,958
Yeah.

456
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:14,458
What is that?

457
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:22,658
Look like at a one-on-one level at A Team level, you know, the different touch points of interactions.

458
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:23,358
Sure.

459
00:58:24,058 --> 00:58:26,558
So I shared the skills catalog.

460
00:58:26,558 --> 00:58:52,158
I have seen some people are coming into it and I think Marines point is spot-on, like the mere fact of asking rather than telling what you can do after you have gotten that, even if you don't have a coach, let us say you have gotten that input from your team about things that you're strong at and things that our growth opportunities and how you can improve on the, on the on both really is you can come back to them, you should come back to them and ask, that's that accountability.

461
00:58:52,158 --> 00:58:56,958
Gina's, hey, you told me this for weeks ago that I need to get better at this thing.

462
00:58:57,258 --> 00:58:58,758
Here's some of the things I have been trying.

463
00:58:58,858 --> 00:58:59,958
And what have you noticed?

464
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:01,558
Like, be honest with me, don't just tell me.

465
00:59:01,558 --> 00:59:04,658
I have gotten better because you want to root for me or whatever.

466
00:59:04,658 --> 00:59:06,358
Like, what have you what are you saying?

467
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:08,158
Have I gotten better at this or not?

468
00:59:08,258 --> 00:59:12,258
And do you have any feedback or advice for me as to how I can improve?

469
00:59:12,558 --> 00:59:15,958
So, we build this into our product, that's part of the coaching is, right?

470
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:27,158
We do that Baseline Where We Gather that data, and then we will come back and Survey the team and provide data that shows that people are actually improving in these skills, but you can do that again.

471
00:59:27,158 --> 00:59:33,858
Like, if you're, if you're really invested in, This and you have got, you know, you feel good about this skills catalog and you're getting feedback from your team.

472
00:59:34,158 --> 00:59:53,258
The worst thing you can do is get all that feedback and then never come back to them and share anything about like you know, they were vulnerable with you and they told you what they thought you could be better at and like, man, that would be such a shame did not come back to them and say, hey, I worked on this and I would love your input as to like whether or not you think I have gotten better.

473
00:59:53,658 --> 00:59:56,158
And I am going to keep working on these areas.

474
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:58,758
So what do you think I can do about the next?

475
00:59:58,858 --> 01:00:01,058
Just four weeks to get better at this.

476
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:02,258
That's huge.

477
01:00:06,758 --> 01:00:06,958
It's great.

478
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:14,758
I am going to open with a question on just I know we're talking about managers a lot, and she would have coaching that supports managers.

479
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:20,458
How does a manager be a good coach for their teams as well?

480
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:30,958
Like so managers that are not you know, coaches professionally, but we know that the best way to you get results for your team is to coach them as well.

481
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:34,558
What are some of those things that managers can take home with you?

482
01:00:34,558 --> 01:00:38,758
Teams to say, no, I am gonna have a team of five people.

483
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:42,858
What are some of those best practices that I can take to my team?

484
01:00:43,058 --> 01:00:45,258
My starting tomorrow right?

485
01:00:45,658 --> 01:00:46,758
From a coaching perspective?

486
01:00:47,258 --> 01:00:47,558
Yeah.

487
01:00:47,558 --> 01:00:51,158
So I have got a I mean at the end of the day it comes down to asking questions.

488
01:00:51,258 --> 01:00:57,558
I have a five-year-old and I think she's a really good model for what this looks like, we're right Gina.

489
01:00:57,558 --> 01:01:02,958
I saw your kid popped in the other day when we were doing the prep, they asked why they ask why all the time, right?

490
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:04,158
There's why is it that?

491
01:01:04,158 --> 01:01:04,958
And then, Why?

492
01:01:05,258 --> 01:01:07,258
So, the five wise is a great model.

493
01:01:07,758 --> 01:01:11,558
But something happens where we lose that from kids, when becoming adults.

494
01:01:11,558 --> 01:01:13,458
And it feels like conflicting.

495
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:17,558
So, I think, again, as a coach, if your job are, sorry, is a manager.

496
01:01:17,558 --> 01:01:25,058
If your job is to coach your team, one of the biggest things tactically, I would say is have your team.

497
01:01:25,058 --> 01:01:29,058
So I have all my direct reports and me kind of like an update each week.

498
01:01:29,058 --> 01:01:30,158
Here's what I worked on this week.

499
01:01:30,158 --> 01:01:33,658
Here's what I am working on next week, and here's the support I need from you.

500
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:38,458
And what That does are when we have our weekly one-on-ones.

501
01:01:38,758 --> 01:01:45,158
I don't have to spend any time getting status updates from you, I can just dive into figuring out what do you need?

502
01:01:46,058 --> 01:01:47,258
So I think that's a tactical thing.

503
01:01:47,258 --> 01:02:01,658
You got to do like you got to take the Tactical status update things, which you need is a manager to do your job out of the synchronous kind of one-on-one time that you have with your direct report and Reserve that time for asking questions.

504
01:02:01,658 --> 01:02:04,358
So you know, I noticed that you're working on this.

505
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:04,758
Thing.

506
01:02:04,758 --> 01:02:06,058
But you're running into this challenge.

507
01:02:06,058 --> 01:02:09,558
Why do you think that's happening and the might give an answer right?

508
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:13,858
Oh well so-and-so just you know, isn't prioritizing this for me.

509
01:02:13,858 --> 01:02:15,158
Well, why do you think that is?

510
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:16,258
Right?

511
01:02:16,258 --> 01:02:20,658
Well I think he's, you know, prioritizing this other thing because he thinks that's more important.

512
01:02:20,658 --> 01:02:23,658
The business like well why do you think that he thinks that's more important than this is?

513
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:25,458
Like, it feels weird, feels unnatural.

514
01:02:25,758 --> 01:02:28,258
But you get to the root of like this is what's going on?

515
01:02:28,258 --> 01:02:30,758
Actually, maybe I failed to articulate.

516
01:02:30,758 --> 01:02:34,458
Why what I need is more important than what he is working.

517
01:02:34,558 --> 01:02:36,658
Hang on to him and him being successful.

518
01:02:36,658 --> 01:02:38,358
Like I never thought about it that way.

519
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:42,458
I am going to change the way I make the ask so that he understands that.

520
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,458
This isn't just a thing I need for my team.

521
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:48,658
Like, this is something he needs and the organization needs to be really successful.

522
01:02:48,858 --> 01:02:50,158
Let me reframe it, that way.

523
01:02:50,758 --> 01:02:52,158
That's your job as a manager.

524
01:02:52,858 --> 01:02:59,358
The other thing I would do and again this comes from this book as well is so you should meet with your direct reports once a week.

525
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:12,958
I think, for sure at least a half hour every week, but what she does is once a month, the one-on-ones are about your career, they're not about the kind of tactical things that you're working on right now.

526
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:20,858
At this company it's more figuring out where do you want to be going with your career and Reid Hoffman?

527
01:03:20,858 --> 01:03:25,058
The founder of LinkedIn has this great framework which is called a row Alliance.

528
01:03:25,058 --> 01:03:26,358
He wrote a book about it.

529
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:35,458
I don't know if y'all heard about this but this idea of like you know we don't live in a world anymore where somebody works at a company for 40 years, and they get the role Watch, by the way.

530
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:36,458
This is not a Rolex.

531
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:43,958
Well, I am sorry, you know, like that's an outdated model people tend to work from, you know, three to five years, and they can they move.

532
01:03:45,058 --> 01:03:51,158
And, so I think acknowledging that as a leader that like, this is an alliance, it's not a power Dynamic.

533
01:03:51,158 --> 01:03:54,758
We're like you work for this company and you need to do what this company needs.

534
01:03:54,758 --> 01:04:03,658
It's like no, we need to also give you the skills and the critical experiences you want to gain to kind of get you to that next level in your career.

535
01:04:03,758 --> 01:04:06,558
So, let us Check, let us document what that looks like.

536
01:04:06,658 --> 01:04:09,258
And then once a month, let us revisit that document.

537
01:04:09,258 --> 01:04:14,258
Like, what are, you know, what zoom out like, hey, you're trying to become a chief marketing officer.

538
01:04:14,258 --> 01:04:17,158
Like, here's some of the things you were hoping to get done this year.

539
01:04:18,158 --> 01:04:25,258
Does that align with the types of stuff that we're working on right now, like why or why not do we want to shift things around like does that make sense for the business to do that?

540
01:04:25,258 --> 01:04:31,558
So I think those types of conversations are really important to avoiding the staff that you mentioned Gina at the beginning of the call.

541
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:49,858
Because when you look at that, voluntary turnover I was Looking at this stat over half of the exiting employees who left a company, say that in the three months before they left, neither their manager, nor any other leaders spoke to them about their job satisfaction or their future with the organization.

542
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:58,558
So, you have got to do that, like, you have got to acknowledge, it's a two-way street, it is not just this person's job to do the job description, you have laid out.

543
01:04:58,558 --> 01:05:03,858
It's your job to set them up for a really successful career in the time that there with you.

544
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:05,958
So good.

545
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:08,658
So we need to check out those two books that you recommended.

546
01:05:08,658 --> 01:05:14,658
You said it was making of the manager by Julie and then there's a Reid, Hoffman one as well.

547
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:21,658
You know, I think mentions it's like Tour of Duty or something the alliance by Reid Hoffman, the alliance.

548
01:05:21,758 --> 01:05:22,458
Okay.

549
01:05:22,658 --> 01:05:23,358
Awesome.

550
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:25,058
Well we got some questions coming in.

551
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:30,758
So let us tackle this first one here or second question for today.

552
01:05:30,758 --> 01:05:33,958
How do you get someone resistant?

553
01:05:35,258 --> 01:05:37,458
20, I just lost it.

554
01:05:37,758 --> 01:05:38,158
Here it is.

555
01:05:39,158 --> 01:05:43,558
How do you get someone resistant to coaching self-aware enough to get the help?

556
01:05:43,558 --> 01:05:44,358
They need.

557
01:05:44,758 --> 01:05:45,358
Mmm.

558
01:05:46,258 --> 01:05:47,158
Such a good one.

559
01:05:50,258 --> 01:05:55,858
I mean, I would love to tell you that 100% of the time.

560
01:05:55,858 --> 01:05:56,758
You can do that.

561
01:05:56,758 --> 01:06:06,758
You can get someone to buy in and say like okay I get it I got to be vulnerable, I got to acknowledge what my blind spots are and what my gaps are.

562
01:06:09,258 --> 01:06:14,358
I was talking to a coach, but the fact the matter is, you can't, everybody is going to get there.

563
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:35,358
And I was talking to a coach about this and saying, kind of like, what is, what is the landscape of people who are Capable of actually, like getting there and doing this, and he said, there's a small minority of people who are literally for psychological reasons, like, incapable of doing this.

564
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:38,358
Maybe it's because of how they are raised, or how their brain is wired.

565
01:06:38,858 --> 01:06:39,958
They just can't do it.

566
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:41,758
They're not willing to be vulnerable.

567
01:06:41,758 --> 01:06:44,558
And so with those folks you have got to figure out.

568
01:06:44,658 --> 01:06:45,558
Do you have one of those?

569
01:06:45,558 --> 01:06:46,158
The odds are.

570
01:06:46,158 --> 01:06:47,558
You don't like the?

571
01:06:47,558 --> 01:06:49,158
He said the vast majority of us are.

572
01:06:49,158 --> 01:06:52,058
Just are his words Garden variety neurotics.

573
01:06:52,558 --> 01:07:03,858
And so with those you can through coaching and through feedback, you can get them there and it's got to be in a way that's, you know, as objective as possible and is clear and specific as possible.

574
01:07:04,058 --> 01:07:09,058
But there are going to be people who just resist and are not able to get there.

575
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:17,158
And in those situations like it's a way more difficult conversation is like is this person going to be successful in this company or in this team?

576
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:20,358
But I would tell you like small minority.

577
01:07:20,358 --> 01:07:23,558
The vast majority are just Like the rest of us Garden.

578
01:07:23,558 --> 01:07:24,558
Variety neurotics.

579
01:07:25,658 --> 01:07:30,658
Yeah, one what one thing I would add to that Tyler and I think going back to like personal professional.

580
01:07:30,758 --> 01:07:47,158
I think if folks are tied to Performance being all personal versus this is a job that I have to get done and the job requires a b c, and d and self-awareness, would say that there is a gap between me understanding how to perform those ABC.

581
01:07:47,158 --> 01:07:49,858
And he's, then I need some support.

582
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:51,458
I need a strategic partner.

583
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:52,558
I need a plan in place.

584
01:07:52,558 --> 01:07:55,258
I need the Milestones to hit the books.

585
01:07:55,458 --> 01:08:03,058
Read the coaching, the program, whatever it is, so that I can grow and hit the mark, on those things that are required.

586
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:06,858
You know, for me, I resisted coaching for a long time.

587
01:08:06,858 --> 01:08:09,358
I have a coach right now, but my wife is a coach.

588
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:21,758
And so, I have always I have at home, we know the power of coaching, but there was a part of me for some time that said, I don't know, I don't want to sit down with someone to sort of like I am leaving to go figure it out.

589
01:08:21,858 --> 01:08:23,758
I am gonna figure it out my own XYZ.

590
01:08:24,258 --> 01:08:35,558
But when you Understand that the job your growth and your growth trajectory is going to require you to learn and adapt at a much faster rate likely than you have before.

591
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:40,957
When you separate that personal Thing versus the job to be done.

592
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:46,058
And when there's a separation there and you look at it tactically and say I have to go do this new job.

593
01:08:46,058 --> 01:08:48,158
Therefore, I need a new manual.

594
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:49,658
Therefore, I need a new skill.

595
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,358
Therefore, I need to sharpen.

596
01:08:51,358 --> 01:08:55,258
This other thing that I haven't done before or I haven't done it in a long time.

597
01:08:55,658 --> 01:09:03,258
It makes it easier to engage in the support and strategic partnership that a coach can bring where I or peer can have.

598
01:09:03,358 --> 01:09:14,258
But if it's, if the person is not able to get to a point of self-awareness, and say, this is the thing that I have to go do, there's a gap here, and I need support, and it's a really, really hard thing to get done.

599
01:09:14,957 --> 01:09:16,058
Yeah, yeah.

600
01:09:16,058 --> 01:09:27,358
I think demystifying, what coaching is, and what I often say is, what we do is we help people have uncomfortable conversations Say that to anybody any Walk of Life.

601
01:09:27,358 --> 01:09:29,658
Any industry, any level of leadership?

602
01:09:29,658 --> 01:09:30,258
They all go.

603
01:09:30,658 --> 01:09:31,558
I need that.

604
01:09:31,658 --> 01:09:33,258
I could use some help with that.

605
01:09:33,258 --> 01:09:35,158
Like of course you can we all deal with it all the time.

606
01:09:35,158 --> 01:09:36,957
They're like, I could use that my personal life too.

607
01:09:37,258 --> 01:09:41,058
So I think when you kind of just get to a something concrete, it's not this.

608
01:09:41,058 --> 01:09:43,457
Woo self Explorer ation.

609
01:09:43,457 --> 01:09:44,758
I mean, there is going to be some of that.

610
01:09:44,758 --> 01:09:52,358
But like, when you get to the problem that's sitting in front of me today, which is like you have to have uncomfortable conversations, would you like some help with that?

611
01:09:52,457 --> 01:09:53,358
I think a lot of people go.

612
01:09:53,358 --> 01:10:01,258
Oh yeah, because if I could do that better, After we can, we could grow so much faster, we could spend so much less money on an attrition all this stuff.

613
01:10:01,658 --> 01:10:12,158
Then it comes solidifies for people like okay, even though that's not an accurate reflection of the totality of what coaching is, I think that's made out of a taste for that, but I think that's a really important.

614
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:18,958
Tyler is like getting as tactful as possible because then that makes it like, oh, okay, these are five things.

615
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:22,158
I have to go work on because I know that there's a gap there right now.

616
01:10:22,258 --> 01:10:25,258
Okay, so how do I drive a better performance for my team?

617
01:10:25,558 --> 01:10:27,158
Right now, we have been performing here.

618
01:10:27,358 --> 01:10:28,658
I need to get them to hear.

619
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:29,658
How do I do that?

620
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:32,958
Well, I am having tough conversations, how do I do that better?

621
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:37,158
Or I am feeling burnt out as a manager because I am feeling all this pressure.

622
01:10:37,558 --> 01:10:39,158
How do I fix that right?

623
01:10:39,258 --> 01:10:46,358
I am versus making it these ambiguities ambiguous sort of like conversation with someone else.

624
01:10:46,558 --> 01:10:47,958
Yeah, yeah.

625
01:10:48,058 --> 01:10:49,358
That's the Doom Loop.

626
01:10:50,658 --> 01:10:51,958
Thanks so much negativity.

627
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:58,658
Without that Clarity and without that structure You know I think it you get into those cyclical do lips.

628
01:10:59,258 --> 01:11:02,158
So all right we got two other questions.

629
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,158
Pull up this next question.

630
01:11:06,358 --> 01:11:12,458
Can you share with us, a personal experience where you struggle between choosing compassion versus empathy?

631
01:11:12,758 --> 01:11:14,258
Which one did you end up choosing?

632
01:11:14,258 --> 01:11:20,158
And why I got one.

633
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:30,058
This is a friend of mine who She processes stress (differently) than I do.

634
01:11:30,758 --> 01:11:33,758
And so it took me a long time to realize she doesn't need compassion.

635
01:11:33,758 --> 01:11:34,658
She needs empathy.

636
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:39,158
When I process the way I process stress is, I am I go boxing.

637
01:11:39,258 --> 01:11:42,058
I go play tennis like I don't need to talk about the thing.

638
01:11:42,058 --> 01:11:43,658
That's stressing me out that actually makes it worse.

639
01:11:43,658 --> 01:11:45,858
It stresses me, more talking about it.

640
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:48,558
So I meditate like, it's not like a bottle it up.

641
01:11:48,558 --> 01:11:53,258
Like I just I process internally but what helps me is more compassion.

642
01:11:53,258 --> 01:11:54,558
Like, hey, help me solve my pride.

643
01:11:54,558 --> 01:11:58,158
If I am coming to you with something like Because I want you to solve my problem.

644
01:11:58,758 --> 01:12:20,258
So I think personally the relationship with this person improves significantly, when I realized all I have to do is just listen to her talk and think about how hard this is for her and articulate that and like you know try to build her confidence up but not solve the problem and that was like Game Changer like for that relationship.

645
01:12:20,258 --> 01:12:21,558
So that's one.

646
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:40,758
Yeah, I have 128 you know, for me, I am always trying to be Mr. Fixit, I am attack in the motor, like this is like, like somebody that I really care about where I work with them or someone and my family, or friend, they're having an issue.

647
01:12:40,758 --> 01:12:42,858
I am like, I am going to fix the thing that's causing you.

648
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:59,958
An issue that will fix the situation, or, you know what, like, I have to be strong it in a personal situation, when families going through grief for The grief and you like, you know what, almost, I am not gonna show my sentimental side.

649
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:07,858
I am not going to show my emotions because I need to be strong for that person that I care about the reality.

650
01:13:08,058 --> 01:13:16,558
They want you to sit with them in De grief, they want you to sit with them in the sorrow and just be there.

651
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:31,858
And listen, and be vulnerable with the person getting under the rock, getting under the boater with the person and just sitting there and say, look, okay, let us just be in this together versus just attacking the boat of the entire time.

652
01:13:31,858 --> 01:13:45,058
There's been countless times, I think in my personal life, that's been a learning lesson for me, because I have always been Mr. Fixit, you don't have to go fix the problem versus just sitting with the person going through the problem.

653
01:13:45,258 --> 01:13:46,058
Not feel you, man.

654
01:13:46,058 --> 01:13:47,158
You and I are very similar.

655
01:13:47,258 --> 01:13:54,658
Next, that's a game changer, and I am probably like, your friend Tyler, where I am like, Hey, I am Sport Boulder.

656
01:13:54,758 --> 01:13:57,358
Can you just be here next to me and cry with me?

657
01:13:58,858 --> 01:14:05,858
And I actually talked about Coach helped me realize like that doesn't, you're not solving the problem like you're a problem.

658
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,658
Solver your Mr. Fixit, it's not working.

659
01:14:07,658 --> 01:14:10,558
So like when you get under the boulder, it actually solves the problem.

660
01:14:10,558 --> 01:14:12,058
So it's scratches your itch, too.

661
01:14:13,258 --> 01:14:14,358
That's really good.

662
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:22,158
Wow, this has been such a rich discussion, and we're literally at time right now, so we made it all the way up to the top.

4
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:53,700
So I am looking forward to kicking up the story and here and unpacking a little bit more about her journey, but in the meantime, just Some housekeeping notes.

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:07,800
And if you need some closed captioning, there is a volume bar, right underneath this stage that you can adjust the volume and hit the CC on.

7
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,200
So with that, we want to start with a poll.

8
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:21,000
So those of you who know Sofia she is an entrepreneur and illustrator a designer, a creative leader.

9
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,300
She's an influencer.

10
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,000
ER, in our day and age today, and she's worked with probably every shoe brand possible.

11
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,800
So, let us take a quick vote of all of these Brands.

12
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,000
Which one did she not work on?

13
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,200
Okay.

14
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,000
So we're seeing Nike and Reebok.

15
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,500
All right.

16
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,200
Well, let us bring Sophia on.

17
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,500
Come on in.

18
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,600
Join me, Sophia.

19
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Hey, hey Gina.

20
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,400
How you do?

21
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
I am doing great.

22
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,700
How are you?

23
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,500
I am good to see you.

24
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
I just noticed a little welcome logo behind you.

25
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,700
I love it.

26
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,600
Nice.

27
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
We have turned it into art as well.

28
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,100
So, so of those logos, which one did you not work with?

29
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:20,300
These are some pretty close answers or know people did their own research, but the fog New balance is the one brand that I actually haven't had a chance to be able to work with gotcha.

30
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:27,800
Okay, but it all, those are some pretty phenomenal brands that you have had the chance to work on and Sophia.

31
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,000
I am so excited to be able to have this moment.

32
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:44,500
Even honored to be able to have this moment to do a little Spotlight on you and hear your amazing journey of how you got to where you are and even doing the work supporting these brands.

33
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,900
And it's quite a fantastic Journey.

34
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,600
But let us go all the way back.

35
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,700
If you could take us back to even your roots.

36
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,200
Like where did you grow up?

37
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,700
And what were those roots like?

38
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,500
Because I know it's all about those roots that shape who you are today.

39
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,400
Oh, yeah.

40
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,100
Absolutely.

41
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,300
I definitely have a lot of credit to give to my groups.

42
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,500
I have been very fortunate and grateful.

43
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:25,100
I had a chance to be able to grow up in New York City, born and raised in Queens, and that definitely played an Into just my identity, you know, being able to be immersed in this environment of a lot of stimulation from noises defense.

44
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,100
I literally would listen to the sound that fall asleep to the sound of car alarms going off.

45
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:51,100
I can literally can remember the exact order of the sound and, but, yeah, I mean, I am just being around so much stimulation, and I am pretty sure I had a TV or something, but I haven't been officially diagnosed but that Definitely contributes to just this Lively energy I have and just always looked for an outlet.

46
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:59,700
So, in terms of present day, you know, I would say I am an illustrator and designer by trade, but I am also very much, a Storyteller work on a number of different types of mediums.

47
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:14,400
Everything from t-shirts to print, magazines to branding and design to selling prints of my work to get having a chance to be able to collaborate with a lot of Brands and also create a parallel.

48
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,100
I don't think sneakers to websites.

49
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:27,800
So really, I am just a Creator, a Storyteller, and loved working on different types of canvases, surfaces platforms, be able to tell stories, that's amazing.

50
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,400
So take us back even further to your upbringings.

51
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:41,800
Yeah, so I mentioned, I am originally from New York, born and raised in Queens and some of my really early influences were, you know, just growing up in the 90s.

52
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,000
You got hip hop, music was really Sneakers was really inspired by the street art.

53
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,600
That was around me.

54
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
We can go to the next Slide.

55
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,500
By the way, the street art that was around me.

56
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,300
Obviously, taking the subway, the overground subway.

57
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,500
You just see all these graffiti around you all the time and just, it was just so much stimulation.

58
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,000
So that's definitely played a lot into.

59
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,100
Just my early years, early influences.

60
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,600
We can go over to the next slide where you can literally see.

61
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,300
I am not kidding when I say and listen to a lot of (hip-hop) and rap music.

62
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,300
New Jersey, by the way, is actually a jersey dress.

63
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,100
You can't tell him that and that photo, that's a little Polo sport bag to bring you know, throw about.

64
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,400
I am doing a lot of it.

65
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Like I was able, you know, I used to work part-time jobs on the side just to be able to get sneakers.

66
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,400
So that's a pair of patent Air.

67
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:46,200
Jordan are Jordan One's classic, you know, just with graffiti and all of that was really inspired to just create my own little tag that I would go to the Post Office, get the sticker draw, a little The situation, I would even die cut it.

68
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,300
That's how it has that shape.

69
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,200
And then I was just like, stick it all around school and stuff like that.

70
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,900
So he's just take, take us back.

71
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,300
Give us a little bit of notes on SC.

72
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,900
Like, how did you come up with?

73
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,600
Is that your name or?

74
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,200
Yeah, so my name is Sophia Chang and my initials RS.

75
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,800
See, so growing up, you know, especially in the graffiti World street art World.

76
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Everyone kind of went by this Alias name, and so I just went by this one just because it was just phonetically sounded like my initials.

77
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,500
And that's what I ended up landing on and then you know, AOL Instant Messenger people made screen names.

78
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,500
I would just do a CES, why?

79
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,100
And I am backwards.

80
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,900
So Ma I so and then you know, I went to college at the buyer website domain.

81
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,000
Do you know what to do?

82
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,700
So just use my screen name.

83
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,900
Same thing with started Instagram.

84
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,700
Everyone's draining, Instagram couldn't think of anything else?

85
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,900
Oh just went with that.

86
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,400
But yeah, that's the story behind.

87
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,600
He ask.

88
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,300
Oh, that is so cool.

89
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,700
I didn't even know that and I know there's like a sc.

90
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,000
And am I right?

91
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,900
And yes, what am I just I am backwards.

92
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,800
Wow, of course.

93
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,400
It's super creative.

94
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,200
I love that.

95
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,800
And these pictures are awesome.

96
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,000
You had cornrows.

97
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:17,300
Did you play sports to um, not really, but Sports culture, you know, which is so deeply intertwined with Arts and Music anyways, right?

98
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:26,600
General, like sense of style, you know, I was obviously really into Street where before they were, it was coined a name, you know, obviously into a lot of them.

99
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:35,500
More 90s inspired types of clothes from wearing a lot of Jordans to, you know, Marc Ecko baby fat.

100
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,600
A lot of these breaths.

101
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,700
Our backgrounds.

102
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,400
Yeah, and then my best friend growing up the girl who's in the photo next to me her older.

103
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,100
Sister would braid hair.

104
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:54,300
So literally after school and Elementary, I would just go over to her house, and we'd watch music videos and her sister would just bring my hair for fun.

105
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,800
So I am just walking around with these cornrows all the time.

106
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:05,300
I, I think there were there was a certain point where I had my whole head done too, but it was just, I mean growing up in Queens.

107
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,600
It's so extremely diverse as well.

108
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:26,800
Like we have we're all like how I explain to people as in elementary school, everyone packs their lunch, kind of And literally have like the Indian kids meeting Indians when you're like to know what is that, you know, people are looking at the food that I am eating, you know, an American, you know, the white kids have their own thing, you know, Spanish kids have this stuff.

109
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,200
So we're all kind of all tasting, each other's home, cooked meals, and you go to your friend's house after school.

110
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,700
And it's just, it's very different.

111
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,700
You know, I grew up in a Christian household where we have to pray before we eat you, go to someone else's house.

112
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,100
It's a whole nother situation.

113
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,400
So it was I was very fortunate to be able to grow up in an environment.

114
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,700
Moment where you know, so deeply inversed amongst so many different types of cultures.

115
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,200
Yeah.

116
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,600
Wow, and would you say a lot of those cultures all of that?

117
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:05,000
Now that it is sparking your creativity in your early years and all of that sort of has influenced the work that you even do today.

118
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,900
Yeah.

119
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,800
Absolutely.

120
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,200
Yeah.

121
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,200
It was just like extreme overstimulation.

122
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,900
I guess that's another way to put it.

123
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,300
Wow, like sight sounds cultures people, you know languages holler languages.

124
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,700
Yeah, you take the 7 train.

125
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,800
That's like one of the primary trains that brings you to Queens every person that says sitting next to each other, the speaking a different language.

126
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,800
So it's just like it's a lot all at once all the time.

127
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,900
Wow, that's exciting.

128
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900
So all of this, these are your roots.

129
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,200
And then what like what happened, how?

130
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,200
Did you get into doing what you do?

131
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,400
What you do today?

132
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,100
Which are.

133
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:54,000
So obviously being just someone who had so much energy always had a lot of interest in the creative arts, you know, shared a little bit about my roots.

134
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,500
So I was really fortunate to be able to go to college and attend Parsons School of Design.

135
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,700
You can do the math and, you know, really valued my four years in undergrad.

136
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:10,800
I majored in illustration and, you know, really learn about the professional side of things.

137
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,200
This a lot of time.

138
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
People would think, oh, drawing is just a hobby.

139
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,500
But how can you actually turn your hobby and passion into a real career into a source of income?

140
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:27,300
And so livelihood a big part that played into just the early days of my career was definitely the internships that I was a part of.

141
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,900
We can go to the next slide.

142
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:44,600
And, so I had a chance to be able to work with complex magazine, which is no longer magazine and mainly like more of a media platform, but just again, applying my route to my interest into areas where I can apply my Skills and education that I was getting.

143
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,900
So beyond just your usual undergrad courses and art school.

144
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,300
I also did internships with the find artist named Ron McKenna's.

145
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:00,800
I had a chance to be able to work in the art Department, as an intern for complex magazine, where I learned about publishing.

146
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,000
How does advertising work?

147
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
How does, how does the advertising Department work with the editorial department, will put the, you know, design Department?

148
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,200
I had a chance to be able to work with a graphic designer that did a lot of work.

149
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,100
Graphics for Street Wear brands that I admired.

150
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:24,200
So, again, looking underneath the hood and being able to be a part of the process of some of my favorite Brands, how do they make their clothes or products?

151
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,600
What does that exact process light?

152
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:35,000
From research to inspiration, to actually designing it to getting it ready for vendor, picking colors figuring out sizing.

153
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,200
And really, like I really was fortunate to be able to work with other creators that were fortunate enough to, you know, give me a chance.

154
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,600
Chance take me under their wing and really show me their way to help me craft my eye as well.

155
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,700
When it comes to just like General design, which is really just Priceless.

156
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,500
And then, you know, fast-forward the next slide.

157
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:04,200
We kind of look at just exactly how my work my or a lot of my artwork looks like now some of the commission's I have had over the years.

158
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,800
So a lot of it is very colorful Lively lot of Storytelling.

159
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,400
It's very busy, a lot of times and a big part of how I would like to describe.

160
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:29,000
My work is very much again inspired by my roots where, you know, in York City, you're on like a subway car and there're sounds, there's people doing all sorts of things.

161
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,100
And then you have all these colorful advertisements all around you or you're walking down the street and Fifth Avenue.

162
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,400
And there's just so much stimulation.

163
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,900
But what is actually a poster or a sign on a bus?

164
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,400
Or something that actually makes you stop in your tracks and catches your attention.

165
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:53,800
And that's always a moment that I always valued even just for myself as someone who lives in a city, a busy City.

166
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:09,300
And I think that General mentality contributed a lot to my general style of work and along with, you know, a lot of, I guess just being involved in the just a, New York scene and being into fashion and music and so forth.

167
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:16,100
It's been able to just open doors for me to be able to On a lot of different types of projects in that space.

168
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,300
So what's the coolest project that your most proud of that you worked on?

169
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,200
And what was the most challenging project that I have ever learned a lot from?

170
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,400
Well, let us see the coolest one.

171
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:43,800
Well, I can say that the easiest one in the most fun one in the one that you know always gets people excited is definitely having the opportunity to be able to work with Anthony Bourdain.

172
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,000
So that was really my big break shortly.

173
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,400
After college.

174
00:20:48,800 --> 00:21:14,900
The story behind that project was and I had a friend of a friend, you know, someone was looking for an illustrator just on Facebook, and they Kind of referred me to someone who happened to be another friend, you know, all around the same age group of newly grads and, you know, not really having much access, but someone did work at the production company that handled a lot of the Travel Channel shows, including No Reservations.

175
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,100
So they had asked me to do an illustration.

176
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
It was totally free.

177
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
It was just an illustration.

178
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:27,000
We posted on Facebook, just as a flyer, to be like, hey, make sure you check out the Boston episode tonight.

179
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,100
It aired.

180
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,000
It looked great.

181
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,300
Apparently, you know people at Travel Channel loved it.

182
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,900
So I actually got called by them don't like directly, and they signed me on for an entire season.

183
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:48,900
So I had a chance to be able to watch every single episode ahead of town of time and work on a custom illustration for each episode, which do they then produce those posters and the heat signed.

184
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,100
And that was their giveaway on Facebook.

185
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,400
It was a very early days.

186
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,700
We want, I want to say like 2010-2011 before.

187
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,100
Major companies are really using social media platforms as well.

188
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,800
Communicate to Their audience.

189
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,600
So that was very exciting because you're very easy client to work with it.

190
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:14,600
He would obviously I think we're doing is a very well-known person and it and as a budding creative to be able to share that.

191
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:24,800
Hey you had a chance to be able to work on a project like this that was very valuable and helpful to be able to you know, just again continue to build my portfolio and share the types of the type of work that I was getting.

192
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,800
And then to answer your question of what was the hardest Most challenging and biggest lessons.

193
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,500
I feel like I am always learning lessons regardless.

194
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,300
I love new challenges.

195
00:22:38,100 --> 00:23:00,300
While I was going to leave you fast-forward on some slides, but essentially a big part of what I like to do today is I take the skills that I have learned over the years, the skills of illustration design print working with people just the whole 360 like 15 years of experience being in this space, you know, just building my On platforms.

196
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:08,900
So I guess it's a marriage of the skills that I have with my own personal interest.

197
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,600
So growing up, you know, loving sneakers.

198
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,000
I started a sneaker platform co-founded a speaker platform called common.

199
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,600
Ace where people get to shop from multiple sneaker retailers at once.

200
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:29,100
Because as a woman who loves to collect sneakers, it's very hard for me to find things in my size is a lot of issues when it comes to accessibility.

201
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,300
TV variety.

202
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,700
So we really wanted to create an aggregator that allowed and empowered women to butt.

203
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,200
And honestly, it's marketed to women, but men, women kids, everyone can use it.

204
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:47,300
It's just another online, aggregator for you to be able to find the product that you want, really, just trying to present ourselves as a One-Stop shop.

205
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,700
And there's always challenges there.

206
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,900
You know, I had to work with a team of people to work with different personalities.

207
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,500
Majority of our team members were women.

208
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:01,700
So it was a team of women, and I was like, oh my gosh, a lot of I usually work in a more male dominated space.

209
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:08,800
So working with different types of emotions and personalities, and especially being someone who's the co-founder and a leader in this space.

210
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:18,200
You know, I definitely had to invest a lot into communication skills and delegation and, and yeah, just a lot.

211
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:28,500
I started to read a lot more into leadership to just learn more and, and how to empower myself as a leader in that space, but that was where just definitely lots of challenges.

212
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,700
But Yeah, I kind of really like to tackle challenges, head-on.

213
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,000
I think it's exciting.

214
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,700
It's always an opportunity to learn, so I am all for it.

215
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,700
Wow.

216
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:49,100
Okay, so touching challenges leadership, you know, some, some of those things, you know, right now.

217
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:58,100
I hear you're the VP of brand of an up-and-coming brand in the tech Fitness space.

218
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,700
Could you talk to us a little bit about that?

219
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,000
And, you know, you're leading a creative team remote?

220
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:14,400
And yeah, there's I am sure there're challenges there because you know, because you meetings all day can lead to a lot of burnouts and exhaustion.

221
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,200
So absolutely.

222
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Yeah, so I have had about you.

223
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,400
10, 10, 15 years of just freelance.

224
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:29,900
And as of November of last year, I accepted my first like full-time role in a really long time.

225
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:35,200
I had a full-time job when I first graduated from college, but it's been a long time since.

226
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,700
And so it's my first time, you know getting back into direct deposit every two weeks.

227
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,900
I was like, oh my gosh, this is amazing and it doesn't help benefit for so long.

228
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,900
We just, you know, Describe freelance.

229
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,400
So it's been really exciting.

230
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,200
So as I mentioned, my title is VP of brand.

231
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,500
So I have had a chance to be able to work with this company that I deeply admire.

232
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,000
It's called myo detox.

233
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,400
We actually have a slide for them as well, and it's actually a physical therapy and Chiropractic practice.

234
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,400
We have about 11 locations in Canada, and three, and Allah.

235
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,600
We're looking to expand, you know, within the u.s.

236
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,300
Very soon, a big part of why.

237
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,300
I will tell you, kind of the whole story of how I kind of stumbled upon my oh, but just like anyone.

238
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:36,400
I know, I just quickly recapped my journey as an illustrator, but that all of that, and all of the amazing art, you saw was a lot of hours behind a computer on a desk Urban.

239
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Ah, McCleary really offset and in my very early 20s shortly after college.

240
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:59,500
I was getting shooting pains in my neck and my lower back and my wrist just from drying and using a mouse and, and I am hours at a desk, even though I loved drawing and I still do to this day love what I do and it definitely really took a toll on my body and plus, you know living in New York.

241
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,700
You carry your whole life on you all day.

242
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,300
Every day.

243
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,900
You just got it.

244
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,100
You can't have a car to stop the stick, your things in.

245
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,100
So, you carry this heavy backpack.

246
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,900
It's cold.

247
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,700
You're physically very tense.

248
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,300
So just takes a really big toll on your, on your body.

249
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:19,300
And everyone has their set of, you know, different types of injuries that their bodies kind of held on.

250
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,300
Over the years, some syrup over time and so forth.

251
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,500
So my story is not that much different and I had a PT person.

252
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,000
I was going, you know, Clinic I was seeing on and off, maybe a chiropractor when I was living in New York.

253
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,200
When I had moved to LA.

254
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,100
I had to find a new PT and a new place.

255
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:41,100
So I stumbled upon my oh and I had one session was completely life-changing.

256
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,400
I think what makes them extremely different for me at that time.

257
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,300
Was, I have never been told that there's hope I never II thought that.

258
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,100
At the pain and discomfort that I experienced was normal.

259
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,000
And that relief was temporary.

260
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:05,100
And a big part of our entire mission is really just getting the world moving helping people understand like moving every day.

261
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:15,400
So I started investing in my 0 in terms of just for myself as a customer, and I was going there once a month over the course of three years.

262
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,300
I was, you know, work was really, really busy lots of hours.

263
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,200
The desk.

264
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,000
I was flying once a month.

265
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,900
I was going between LA and New York.

266
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,600
Very often.

267
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,700
This is pretty covid.

268
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,100
And that was really the one relief that I found were it.

269
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,000
It future-proof my body.

270
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,400
Meaning allowed me to continue doing what I love, which is drying working.

271
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,100
I never want to stop doing that.

272
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,100
And now, you know, obviously, I am an active person as well.

273
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,300
But this was just that additional supplement.

274
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:49,200
I needed in my routine just like how someone flosses their teeth every day, you know.

275
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Brush your teeth that it's just part of the maintenance or you have a therapist that you speak with that supports your mental health.

276
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:01,000
This was my staple and my everything in terms of just caring for my body.

277
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:11,000
So the same type of treatment that a Superstar athlete would get you know on the Courtside during a game of physical therapy treatment.

278
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,000
We get we package that for everyday people like you and I whether you're a plumber or a lawyer or a celebrity Superstar singer or whatever it is.

279
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,100
I will have a one body for the rest of our lives.

280
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,600
How can we continue to care for it?

281
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,700
And essentially, you know, learn more about it because my body is different from yours.

282
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,100
Are not their anatomies different.

283
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,000
We have different habits.

284
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:44,800
So, I always had this feeling of what guys, you would love to work for this company one day and I kind of got to place with my freelance work, where I had some really good years.

285
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,100
I started working like seven days a week with freelance and started to get really crazy.

286
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:57,000
And you know, I in many ways also felt like I work with a lot of amazing Brands and kind of reach it.

287
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,100
My own little ceiling and wanted more of a challenge for myself because Beyond just illustration design.

288
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,600
I also have more of a knack for strategy as well.

289
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:21,000
So I have been very fortunate to be able to join their team and, you know, support on their creative Endeavors and support on some of their marketing and strategy initiatives, which Just been so fulfilling.

290
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:28,400

295
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,200
Yeah.

296
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,700
Let me know when they're in Vegas.

297
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,500
Yeah.

298
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,300
Yeah, we could do that too.

299
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,000
That's true.

300
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,700
Okay, next trip to La.

301
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,900
So, you know, you're leading this creative team remotely.

302
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,700
How are you yourself?

303
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,400
Preventing burnout and from getting fatigued from meeting after meeting.

And how are you keeping your teams engaged and inspired?

305
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:21,800
Yeah, so I mentioned earlier that Our companies also Canadian.

306
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,200
So a lot of our team members are split between US and Canada.

307
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,200
There's a lot of different technical laws when it comes to.

308
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,300
Like how people house just to Medical Physical Therapy field is in Canada versus u.s.

309
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,000
So there's so you're almost working with two different companies.

310
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Plus you have different people who are in different countries with in different time zones.

311
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:49,200
So, you know, obviously, especially since, so we have kind of been working very virtuous.

312
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:55,100
So, for a while, we never actually had a home-based office, but with that obviously comes lots of challenges.

313
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,200
So covid-19 a huge shock for us.

314
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,200
But yeah, like I think, you know, all of us definitely use your usual platforms to be able to communicate.

315
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,900
And, for myself, personally.

316
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,700
I am obsessed with productivity.

317
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:18,900
So I read a lot into productivity with some of my favorite Outlets are like to do this task to do it as a great blood.

318
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,700
So it Close blog that I love to use.

319
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:29,200
But I love to read their blogs, just to learn like little tips and tricks, big fan of Cal Newport as well, the author of deep work.

320
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:41,800
So I am always looking into ways to be able to optimize my workflow, and she's ways to be able to improve how work of course, burnout is very common in a big part of how I like to manage.

321
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:49,200
That is again, like through that education and awareness by researching and learning more about music.

322
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:55,300
Lots of resources for more than anything, you know, you have to remember you're in control, and I am always all about calibrating.

323
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,500
So I don't know if you're into productivity, but there's you know, Cal Newports, deep work.

324
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,100
There's also getting things done by David Allen.

325
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,700
There's a new show at the Pomodoro Technique.

326
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:10,000
There's so many different types of techniques and sometimes it's for me, it's more.

327
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:18,600
So just exposing myself to all of them and then testing and trying and seeing which one's work for me in certain times and certain phases of my life and my career.

328
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,900
And work mode and that helps me protect my time.

329
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:37,500
And, you know, for example, blocking out, certain type of whether there's everything from, you know, time blocking today, theming to there's so many different types of day.

330
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:44,600
Theming is if you dedicate specific days to different parts of your work, so Mondays are specifically for accounting.

331
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,100
Operational stuff.

332
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,200
Tuesdays are for me to do deep work, creative work.

333
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,800
He think, no cause that day is great and days for me to do any type of marketing Social Media stuff.

334
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,100
So that doesn't work for me as well.

335
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:03,700
But, you know, again, to each their own, there's no like one answer, everyone's different, and they have different circumstances, especially in their home.

336
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,900
So, it's just so great to be able to expose yourself to these resources.

337
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,000
So, that's definitely something.

338
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:24,900
I bring into the way, I work with my team, and I am also always thinking about ways that I can support them on prioritization specially when you're trying to fulfill Creative needs for such a, you know, so pretty large company to some extent.

339
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,900
There's a lot of different clinics, a lot of locations.

340
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,500
Lots of people needing things from you.

341
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,400
How can we build?

342
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:38,800
This is kind of the productivity part again, how can we build proper systems and infrastructures so that there's efficient workflow?

343
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,900
So I am really into notion.

344
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:49,199
I am really the Trello and asada and basically, I love all those types of apps and building a healthy Foundation that helps manage the entire.

345
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,699
Fire massive amount of workloads that are coming in.

346
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:59,500
So I am always, I don't, I always kind of, I am constantly doing but General, like, business, hygiene housekeeping.

347
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:06,500
Cleaning up my own house is nothing to be honest, but I am from a business perspective.

348
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:12,000
I am always just, you know, pruning away and cleaning up because it's like doing your laundry.

349
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,100
It's like, you know, just general maintenance and I know that's definitely like helps to support our teams.

350
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,900
And I think when we can Speak of where way, where we lead by example as well.

351
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,500
And also share those resources.

352
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:36,900
It definitely helps to create a paradigm shift and also creates has shifted being just a general culture of your team because you can do everything, but you can't do everything.

353
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,900
So how do I?

354
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,200
Like I never say any ideas really bad.

355
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,600
I kind of just shelf ideas sometimes, but I always keep a little record of it.

356
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,400
So then we need to like refresh and revisit the, it will be there.

357
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,600
You can't, you had Idea for reason, we can always revisit it at a later time.

358
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,800
But yeah, I think, you know, just, I myself and just a huge advocate for productivity.

359
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,800
So, definitely tried to bring that into conversations as much as I can with my team.

360
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
I love that.

361
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Well, we're almost wrapping up at time here.

362
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:19,300
But for any of those that have questions for Sophia, go ahead and drop your questions either, even in the chat, or there is a Q&A tab up there, you know.

363
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,500
Feel free to ask any questions in the meantime.

364
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,000
Sophia.

365
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I am curious.

366
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,500
You know what's next?

367
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Like, I know you have got the VP of brand thing, but you always got something else too.

368
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,900
You know there.

369
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,200
What's next for you?

370
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:39,900
What is what's your next like North Star that you want to accomplish?

371
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,600
Yeah, I think as many as different hats that I have worn over the years.

372
00:36:47,100 --> 00:37:00,700
I feel like the North Star has always been Present, you know, using the skills that I have finding, you know, speaking in a very passionate authentic way, that's always true to myself and my own personal interests, and I just really love storytelling.

373
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:07,400
I think what's next for me is always just learning new skills, and continuing to harness those skills.

374
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,500
I think like definitely building in this Rule, still pretty recent, you know, it's only been like, 7 months, but I love it.

375
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:28,500
And I would love to be able to see my sin, and I think the most exciting part about my role, and, We're positioned out today is I really see the company's growth and actually see my own skill sets being a part of that company's growth and that's the most exciting part.

376
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
So I think I will be here for a while.

377
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,300
I am still freelancing on the side.

378
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:37,900
I am actually going to be doing, I am going to be painting at like a football game tomorrow.

379
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,000
Wait, this is really tomorrow evening.

380
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,100
Yeah, so it's called secret walls.

381
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,500
They have artists kind of battle each other.

382
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,300
So, so you team up with an artist, and we each get a side of a wall.

383
00:37:49,500 --> 00:38:03,700
We created look so that creative outlet and need to draw a great will always be there and thankfully the opportunity still come about, and I am still working on some fun collections with some sneaker brands that are going to be coming out next year.

384
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,300
It's all, it's all happening and it's all doable.

385
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,800
And yeah, I would say like right now freelance is fine.

386
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:22,100
And then fighting I am still doing it on the side by my biggest focus is just to really make sure the whole world knows about While detox, love it.

387
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,600
Okay, and it's a challenge.

388
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,700
It's always a challenge.

389
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:29,400
And I feel like my, I am always telling myself, like, could I be doing more?

390
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:36,300
And I think it's because it's not as easily fulfilled as like me, getting a great job, getting all the Press.

391
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,400
It's like I have to work in a whole different way, and I am really enjoying the challenge.

392
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,300
Mmm.

393
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,900

394
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,600

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,700
Nice.

421
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,200
Nice.

423
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,300
That's it.

424
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,000
That's great.

425
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,400
All right, so, what drink are we making today?

So we are going to make bubbles all day because anytime is a good time for bubbles, and we love it.

427
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,200
Easy to make easy to recreate.

428
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,100
Make it home.

429
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,700
Have it any time of the day?

430
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,200

00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,700
All right, we will take it away for us.

432
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,500
Awesome.

433
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,000
Thanks, Gina.

434
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,500
Good to see you.

435
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,100
What's up?

436
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,800
Everybody?

437
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,200

438
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,800
I am a Creator bordega.

439
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,900
Cocktail Club and author.

440
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:25,600
Of Raise Your Spirits cocktail book all about crafting a good cocktail at home.

441
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,900
You don't have to spend hundreds of dollars on equipment.

442
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:40,200
You probably have everything you need right in your kitchen to craft a good cocktail part of a Hospitality Group in Asbury, Park, New Jersey, and we created this Cocktail Club.

443
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:48,900
When we had some free time over the past two years when our restaurants and our Bars were closed, and we wanted to reach out to everybody.

444
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,200
In the virtual land that we couldn't, we couldn't connect with on site and just talk about Cocktails.

445
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,200
So yeah, thanks for having me today.

446
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,200
Hope you guys are been making some good cocktails at home.

447
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:08,000
But like I said it's easy to do and you have everything you need right in your kitchen.

448
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:08,800
Today.

449
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,700
We are making bubbles all day.

450
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:18,800
So this kind of good cocktail you can make as a mocktail or as a, you know, just a regular cocktail as well.

451
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,900
It is very versatile.

452
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,500
This by switching out a few different ingredients.

453
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,100
Yeah.

454
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,000
So we like to go over what we have behind our bars when you can use at home.

455
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,100
If you don't have the right equipment.

456
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,700
Like I said, you probably have everything.

457
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,500
You need right next to you.

458
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,600
We're going to shake up this cocktail.

459
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:47,300
So I am going to use a Boston style Shaker set, but more popular homes Shaker is that cobbler style?

460
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,400
That's got that top with the built-in strainer.

461
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,500
You don't have anything to shake with, it's fine.

462
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,800
You just need something that's going to lock in your ice in your ingredients.

463
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:01,000
We use a protein drink Shaker that's collecting dust in your cabinet.

464
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,600
If you use a mason jar, just want to get that proper chill and dilution.

465
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,100
And yeah.

466
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,200
You other things that you need some frozen water.

467
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,500
Make sure you have some ice handy.

468
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,300
When we're making drinks at home.

469
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,900
I like to keep our ice stored in some freezer.

470
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:30,200
Eggs, just to keep any aromatics, my refrigerator off of our ice out of our cocktails, but always having some new ice from Cocktail very popular.

471
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:37,500
So if you're having a cocktail session cocktail party, sure you get enough ice ready and good clean Spirit.

472
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,800
What's great about this cocktail is that it's very versatile?

473
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,200
If you want to use vodka you can use Jin.

474
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,400
You can wrong news wila.

475
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:56,300
We love tequila, but the original recipe calls for vodka is very Kind of, like I said, versatile cocktail, but you can always just lean on whatever spirit that you like best.

476
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,200
Of course.

477
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,000
We're going to be adding some bubbles to some sparkling wine.

478
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,400
We have got a kava root.

479
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,500
So a little dryer.

480
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,100
Not too sweet, not to overpower the cocktail.

481
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,600
Now, if you wanted to make a cocktail, all we have to do is, you know, not, add your spirit.

482
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:27,100
And substitute your champagne or sparkling wine with Soda, the nice little bubbly cocktail, some ingredients that we will be using as well is a honey syrup.

483
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,000
Now instead of using just raw honey.

484
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,300
Honey tends to like stick to the Shaker.

485
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,600
Even stick to the ice.

486
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,200
You make a honey syrup, which is just equal parts of honey and water.

487
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,900
This to dilute that honey.

488
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:47,900
That makes it much easier to aerate and dilute in your cocktail and mixes much better and you still get that nice sweetness.

489
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,900
We're also using some fresh.

490
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,900
And squeezed, lemon juice makes all the difference in the world.

491
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,700
Make sure you have fresh Citrus in your cocktails.

492
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:03,300
Don't use it against us, controlling the ingredients not using any artificial mixers or filling up on a ton of juice.

493
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:10,100
You want to get some fresh Citrus in there and not even have to use that much to get that nice tart flavor in there.

494
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:19,100
We're going to be using lemon juice and what I like to do, with our lemons, you know, whether using hand juicer for juicing, it by this hand.

495
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,700
Am I like to keep the peels for last-minute Expressions on a cocktail?

496
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:29,000
So there's a lot of great flavors and fragrances that live in the oils of our citrus fruits.

497
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,800
So what I would do is just grab a peeler, as a y-shaped.

498
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,100
Peeler great for citrus.

499
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:38,200
Fruits can use any kind of Veggie peeler, or just a paring knife?

500
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,200
No, just taking off a nice P, like that.

501
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,700
I am going to keep it to the side and I will garnish my cocktail with this.

502
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:50,900
But using all those great oils for fragrance and for a little bit of zesty flavor.

503
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,200
So we're making a cocktails all about balance.

504
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,400
So we want to have our most important tool is are measuring utensil few things.

505
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,200
You can use.

506
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,400
We use a jigger.

507
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:12,400
This is a Japanese cone style Jigger, has different volume denominations and even has some nice etchings inside from a half ounce, three-quarter ounce and so on.

508
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:19,900
But if you don't have a jigger, use a measuring spoon, tablespoon is equivalent to a half an ounce.

509
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,200
So easy way to play.

510
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:21,800
A along.

511
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:42,300
Make a cocktail this by using a measuring spoon or if you have something small measuring cups, but either way, if they seem most important utensil just so you can consistently recreate that cocktail, no matter how we like to, you know, whatever you're using, and then tend to your palate.

512
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,400
So if you like things a little less interesting, little more sweet.

513
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,100
You can manipulate those flavors to make it the way you like it each time.

514
00:45:51,400 --> 00:46:05,000
Then switching out some ingredients, but following these template makes you know, just a little better at going off and crafting, your own cocktail, but all the cocktails and our bars are our own recipes that we want to make.

515
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,300
Sure that guess has that same experience, no matter who bartending.

516
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,300
So we're always measuring at hot.

517
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,500
Yeah, I guess let us make the bubbles all day.

518
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,200
Shall we one thing to note?

519
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,000
You know that club.

520
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,800
So, Soda that sparkling wine that never goes in the shake.

521
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:32,000
Okay, just like we don't shake up and a beer or a bottle of wine or anything carbonated.

522
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,800
We don't shake so that will go in after we strain out our cocktail.

523
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,600
We also like to build our cocktails dry so high schools in last.

524
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,400
Once, your ice in your ingredients, meet clock starts.

525
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:44,900
Ticking.

526
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,100
Ice will start melting.

527
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,900
It could over dilute your cocktails.

528
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,000
We only add ice once.

529
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,200
You're ready to start shape.

530
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,200
Also, kind of flavor up this, not do with different ingredients.

531
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:10,400
But if you want to model in some different berries, for a little bit of spice pepper, we can reach to your liquor shelf and grab a different lock or Louise, only use like a little bit at a time because a little goes, a long way with these different reporters.

532
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,000
And editors.

533
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,700
We're going to use some a parole.

534
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,900
An hour cocktail, it's completely optional.

535
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:31,500
But I like the after all very popular because the Apple s grits, it's a red bidder from the Amore family, adds a nice little kind of Bittersweet component and a nice little pretty cute tour cocktail.

536
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,900
You're not familiar with the after all.

537
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:41,000
This is its a nice kind of way of introducing yourself to the mares are red bitters that go into our cocktails.

538
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,100
It's older brother.

539
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:46,500
I would say Campari very better, very aggressive.

540
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,300
After all is a nice little softer way, go bad it.

541
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,900
But this only would be using a half an ounce just to kind of give a nice little balance.

542
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,400
All right.

543
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:03,900
So first I am going to add our honey syrup and same thing with all the cores are syrups little goes a long way.

544
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,700
And I am just going to have a half ounce of a touch of Sweetness in the cockpit.

545
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,200
So I have got my honey syrup ready to go.

546
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,900
I am just going to measure out a half ounce.

547
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,200
Go right in the shaker.

548
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:29,400
Notice, I am also using my least expensive ingredients first just in case I have a little spill precious booze isn't going to go to waste just yet.

549
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:41,400
So I have my sweet with my honey syrup, and I am going to have my Citrus, and I am going to add three-quarter ounce of our fresh squeezed lemon juice .75.

550
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:55,300
So making a traditional sour style cocktail first similar to like a bee's knees.

551
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:03,500
You always want your sweet, your citrus and your spirit, the main components to your sour style cocktails.

552
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,000
Bee's knees Margarita's Daiquiris gimlets.

553
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,800
Those are also our style cocktails all that same template with those three ingredients.

554
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,300
So I have got my sweet.

555
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,800
I have got my Citrus now, my spirit whatever is Andy that you'd like to use.

556
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:24,400
Like I said, very versatile, I am going to use a silver rum in this and with this, we're going to go an ounce and a half.

557
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,700
Now you can make this as low alcohol as you like to just want like a, you know, low ABV.

558
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,300
We call them loaf on top sales, and she don't want to go too aggressive.

559
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,300
So I mean, it's just a Thursday.

560
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,500
Thursday is new Friday.

561
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,000
Let us go one and a half ounces.

562
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,400
I am going to go, 1.5.

563
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,300
Now cocktail just like that is good to go.

564
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,900
But I am going to add a little bit extra little, you know, pop to this cocktail.

565
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,100
I am going to add some after all and just going to use a half ounce.

566
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:13,000
Now, if you have something like an elderflower liqueur, Ginger liqueur, maybe a berry liqueur again, just use a little bit half hours, just to give that little extra pop of flavor.

567
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,800
So, This doesn't want to come off.

568
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:27,100
All right, so in cases like these, when you can't get the cap off of your bottle, just run it under some warm water and that will lose.

569
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:31,500
The sugars that are keeping this from coming off the top of my bottle.

570
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,900
Live TV, anything can happen.

571
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,400
So I am going to opt to not even have the after all my cocktail this time.

572
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,200
Good thing.

573
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,700
That's an optional component.

574
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,900
So cocktail is ready to shape.

575
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,300
I am just going to add some ice, just enough, ice the top, the components in my shaker.

576
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:07,500
And then once we lock in our shaker, if you want to get a good Vigor shake for about 10 seconds, that's just enough to aerate.

577
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,700
The, all your components, all your ingredients, you get that good.

578
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,000
Chill.

579
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,500
And you always want to add a little bit die.

580
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:13,900
Lucien.

581
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,300
You want to get a little water to into the cocktail as well.

582
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,800
So lock it in.

583
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,100
No, don't shake it at somebody, you know, I don't want to weaponize these cocktails.

584
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,100
Always try to get your hands on it and Get away.

585
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,600
So, check it out, guys.

586
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,800
Ice hope.

587
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:43,500
All right.

588
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,700
So check it.

589
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,600
However, you want to.

590
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:55,100
Yeah, go ahead the Shaker if you want, but any kind of glass eight-year at home heirs, have it out of the coffee, mug, have it on the rocks and rocks this.

591
00:51:55,100 --> 00:52:01,400
If you like, I have got this nice Coupe glass that I would like to turn it into just been begging to be used.

592
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:01,700
Now.

593
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,000
I am going to use a Hawthorn style strainer.

594
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,500
This just says, he's flexible coil sits right on top of my shaker.

595
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:14,400
You don't have a strainer, you know, you can use a couple Forks that would Finance training at your cocktail.

596
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,500
The Strain this out first.

597
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:31,100
Notice the drink right now is great to drink on its own, not a ton of volume, not filling up on a lot of artificial mixers are, you know, ton of juice?

598
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,700
It's a much easier to drink another one, but I want to add some bubbles.

599
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:43,200
Now if you just made it with lemon and honey, and no booze and you have a nice little kind of funny lemonade, which is fine.

600
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,200
Just want to add some club soda.

601
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,000
I am going to be adding some.

602
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,800
F****** wine and use about like 2.

603
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,300
Oz.

604
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,300
You don't have to measure it.

605
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,200
You can kind of just give it a little lift.

606
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:56,500
Now.

607
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,500
You don't want to add too much.

608
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,700
Big can't take away.

609
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,800
You can always add more.

610
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,100
So I am just going to give it a little lift.

611
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,900
It's a nice little effervescence.

612
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,000
For the cocktail.

613
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:20,800
Now the last piece I am going to use that lemon wedge, or I am sorry, lemon peel that I would save and by pinching it a holding it over.

614
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:38,600
The cocktail with a bright yellow side, down the release those oils on top of the cocktail that's going to help with the your the aroma and just a little extra of citrus zest and might not be able to see it here, but it's little fireworks will shoot.

615
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,000
Tick-Tock tell just by pinching it.

616
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,400
So, put it in there.

617
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,000
Those are fireworks.

618
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,700
BBB over your cocktail.

619
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,400
And you can either leave it in there as a garnish or get rid of it.

620
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,400
Here's there.

621
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,000
We have it.

622
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,100

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:18,000
All right, so we're going to kick this off and jump into a pole, you know, burnout and fatigue is at an all-time high.

17
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:29,100
And what we're seeing is that leaders that portray empathy in with their teams with especially with a distributed or hybrid remote.

18
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,200
Workforce.

19
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:41,200
We're finding that the it's not only successful but it's a strategic Advantage for leaders that truly lead their teams with empathy.

20
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,600
So on a scale of 1 to 10, how well do you feel your leadership team leads with empathy?

21
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,500
Okay, everyone.

24
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,500
Tense, 7% says 10.

25
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,100
All right, okay.

26
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,900
Okay, adjusting real-time there.

27
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,500

28
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,200

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, I would love to hear a little bit more about Each of you and particularly how you're white you're responsible for today.

44
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,200
The main topic is how we're leading are distributed.

45
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,900
Workforce has.

46
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,800
So give us a penis.

47
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,100
A little picture of the teens that you're leading.

48
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,800
How are these structured regionally, you know, feel free to share?

49
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,400
And I, let us start with you to Mika, and we will go around.

50
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,000
Hi.

51
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
Good afternoon everyone.

52
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,600
My name is Tamika Smith, and the CEO of the Virginia Community Health Plan at you.

53
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,600
Knighted Healthcare.

54
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,700
I have a span of control of 300 employees.

55
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,700
I like to call them teammates and our team members.

56
00:08:48,400 --> 00:09:02,000
Most of those individuals are clinicians and their job is to serve and help support to navigate this complex Healthcare System for the members that we have in our, in our program.

57
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:16,300
We currently have and serve nearly 300,000 members and so a lot of our members Burgers are all of our members are on Medicaid or there, or they qualify for Medicare meaning their dual eligible.

58
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:27,900
And what that means is these are people that are often marginalized in our communities, are underserved and may even suffer from the social determinants of health.

59
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,200
And these are things that prevent an individual from achieving their highest health potential in a lifetime.

60
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,600
And so we serve those people on a day-to-day.

61
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,700
Aces and I have to do it across the entire state of Virginia.

62
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,900
And there are six regions within the Commonwealth of Virginia that we do that through.

63
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,800
And so, having a distributed Workforce is real.

64
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,300
I live and breathe it every day.

65
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:05,400
And so, happy to be here to talk to you about what we see in our business, on a day-to-day basis, and how complex it is, and how we're trying to unravel that.

66
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,800
Thank you, Tomika.

67
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,300
I am headed over to you, Roberto.

So Bienvenidos, we, you know, we're fast growing company serving.

Helping distributed Workforce has been more connected, and so we're serving customers across the gamut of, you know, tech companies to financial institute's and everything in between really helping them connect their employees like never before.

72
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:47,600
And I am glad to be part of this conversation because I distributed Workforce add layers of complex complexity, right to leaders to peers to, how are you in pathetic?

73
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,700
How do you really understand all the complexities that this new way of work?

74

But yeah, I am here for we're distributed team across the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.

77
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,600
I am so glad to be here.

Heading over to you, London.

80
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,300
Hi everyone.

81
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,000
My name is London.

82
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,400
Lomax.

83
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,400
I am a chief strategic advisor for Aetna.

84
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,500
A CVS Health company, and I am excited to be here today as well.

85
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,300
You know, our goal is to be a, you know, every moment of Health, for all of our members.

86
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,200
We serve about 24 million members across the country in the United States.

87
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:41,400
So, you know, all over the place and to the point of Roberto and Tamika distributed Workforce is essential in, making sure that We can service our members and ultimately a happy.

88
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,500
And engaged Workforce is the best for our members as well.

89
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,300
Awesome.

90
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,000
All right, so jumping into our first question.

91
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,200
What does empathy mean to you?

92
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Let us just start with that.

93
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,700
What is empathy mean to you?

94
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,600
And then you can go into.

95
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,100
How are you thinking about empathy with your teams?

96
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,400
Well, the first starting you kick us off.

97
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,100
Hey, hey, there to hear what you have to say potato here.

98
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,600
I am good.

99
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,200
I am good with it.

100
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
So high level, you know, it was funny.

101
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,000
I was having this conversation.

102
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,800
First of all, I will be the first one to admit.

103
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
I am not an expert at empathetic leader thing.

104
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,000
I think it's a, we're learning every day.

105
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,900
We learn as we grow, but it's really.

106
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,100
I had a conversation about this couple weeks ago.

107
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:40,500
Somebody was asking, hey, what's the difference between being sympathetic and empathetic and You know, being sympathetic is, I feel sorry for this person, right?

108
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:51,500
That's like the Cleavers definition of that being empathetic is, I can relate to that person, but being able to authentically, say you can relate to that person is being able to put yourselves in their shoes.

109
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,900
Which requires you to slow down, pause a second and go there and say, you know what?

110
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:05,600
I hired a rockstar single mom, and she's working for us, and she's a single mom of two if I am empathetic to her.

111
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:21,500
That means that I am politically trying to place myself in her shoes managing the schedules that we have managing the demands of a customer managing the time zones and then asking myself, how do we make sure that we enable her to thrive in those circumstances?

112
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,600
And I think that's, it was tration of being empathetic is saying, you know what?

113
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,200
Let us pause.

114
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,100
Let us understand this scenario, this person, the complexities of their circumstances.

115
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
And then, how do we make decisions based on that?

116
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,500
That's a high level.

117
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,100
Perspective on my site on being empathetic.

118
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,100
Love that.

119
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:49,100
I mean, I would Echo that and just say for me it means, you know, having a true understanding or ability to understand people at a human level.

120
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:49,900
Right?

121
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:58,200
And I think what that yields are an element of respect for the lives of the people that you're working with and the things that they're going through.

122
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,300
So I will snap onto what they did, what they both said.

123
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:18,800
So I will first say what they said to think that they put it, put it very well, but I also to would add that all the more reason why it's important for us to appreciate the differences, amongst all of us in amongst all the people that are on the team, right?

124
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,000
We are walking a very different shoes.

125
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,400
One woman is not the same as the same woman as a next one.

126
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,700
Man is not the same man as a next right?

127
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,000
You may have a father that is a single father.

128
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,500
Could be how he could have adopted children?

129
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,100
He get a foster kid.

130
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,400
He could be a widower, right?

131
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:55,000
And so you got to take time to understand your staff, your teammates and then be sensitive to the difference that they bring to work every day and the difference in their Lifestyles and what's going on in their individual circumstances and the other.

132
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,900
The other thing I would say about it is The one thing that we can count on in life is change, right?

133
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:11,900
And so, we're all going to go through changes in our lifetime that require us to behave differently to function differently to cope differently.

134
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:18,600
And so, I think being an empathetic leader, we have to take that into consideration that we can expect someone to deliver.

135
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,000
A hundred percent of the time because we're human and things are going to happen.

136
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:31,900
And so having empathy to Roberto's point in like, walking in someone's shoes and understanding what they're going through.

137
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,900
And to London's point being human about, it gives us an opportunity to say.

138
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,200
Okay.

139
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,700
Listen, I am going to provide this individual with Grace at a certain point in time and it may be forever.

140
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,300
You may need to adjust a work schedule.

141
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:53,500
They need to do something different, but the end of the day, if you're treating For who they are individually, it matters and it makes a difference.

142
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,100
So good rich.

143
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,300
I was like tweetable is quotables right there from all of you.

144
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Thank you for sharing.

145
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:09,300
So you know what you think about empathy with your distributed team in particular?

146
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:18,000
How do you balance being empathetic but also driving for results and maintaining high performance?

147
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
They have sort of feel like they could conflict.

148
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Yeah, that's a great point.

149
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,700
And I think I have we have talked about this before is empathy and results are not mutually exclusive, right?

150
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,900
You can be empathy forward and results driven at the same time.

151
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:40,200
I think the misconception historically, has been that you have to have the care to the stick and often, you got that, right?

152
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:51,900
You got to drive those results and in a way, that's not empathetic, but I think as we have seen, not just through the pandemic, but over time even generationally, it's becoming more and more important to understand.

153
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:58,700
People understand what drives them and what inspires them and what gets you result, while also being human.

154
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,300
And I think, you know, that's something that I constantly work on.

155
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:19,900
I know to make it as an owner for a long time, and I am sure, you know, the welcome team does as well, but it's really important to understand that, you know, you can have both, Absolutely, that's 100%.

156
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:35,300
I think one of the things that, if you rewind years ago, I think people will look at empathetic leadership as a soft skill and not a performance indicator, and it's completely, like, in recent years.

157
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:41,100
It's become so much more evident that empathetic leadership drives the best result possible.

158
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:53,000
And I think in the question being for the distributed Workforce, I think that it's, it's become such a necessity more than anything else for us, and we distributed teams.

159
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:03,400
Well, I think that at a high level, when you look at initial studies out there, that show sympathetic leadership, just least it's a better results in better performance.

160
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:14,100
And I think at the heart of It, kind of humanizing that a second, I was talking to a mentor while back, and she said, hey, you know what?

161
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,900
Every time I on board a new employee.

162
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,700
The first question, I asked that person is what's the most important thing to you outside of work?

163
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,300
And what are you trying to accomplish outside of work?

164
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Because we hired you, we're going to go, we're going to go work.

165
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,700
We're going to go up field.

166
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,800
We're going to get into battle together, but then go chase a number but for you and this season, what's the most important thing?

167
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:43,400
And I think that just starts to establish the foundations that can lead to more empathetic leadership.

168
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,700
All right.

169
00:18:43,700 --> 00:19:01,600
So for instance, this person says, you know what the most important thing in this season right now is my kids recital and actually, Has practice every time at 9 AM On Friday is the most important to think, for me this season, because she'd been working really hard and I want her to be excellent at that.

170
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,400
So now it's a leader and as a manager.

171
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:11,100
Now, you know, by just asking that question that 9:00 in the morning is off limits for Samantha who lives in Georgia.

172
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,800
Because that's the most important thing for her.

173
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:20,700
Now, just one simple question, allows you to be sympathetic to an employee in a very material way because that's the most important thing for her.

174
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,800
And that's even right.

175
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,700
And I think that At us in a distributed Workforce.

176
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:32,900
We just have to lean in a little bit harder Than Leaders to understand what are those opportunities for us to fill the Gap right?

177
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:40,400
As leaders and make sure that person pride and when we do that, I think performance of six Carousels because if you take care of your people, they're going to date.

178
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,100
They owe it to you.

179
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,500
They like, you know what you look out for me.

180
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:59,200
I am going to look out for you and this company, and I am here for I mean, I couldn't, I couldn't agree more with that, and I think, companies, and, or leaders that lead without empathetic leadership will suffer at the end of the day.

181
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
And I think if they're, if they're doing it now, they're suffering.

182
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:13,300
Now if they continue to do what they will suffer, even more in the future, you know, one of the things that we do on my leadership team and then it's been cascaded, right?

183
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,200
But one of the things that we do to make sure that we're double-clicking on, Knowing each other.

184
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:28,100
So we first subscribe, I something like to call first team, and our for our first commitment is to our first team and that's our executive leadership team.

185
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:39,000
And the reason being is you think about being on a national sports team, you're throwing the ball that team, not the team that sitting behind that, the second team gets the first team, right?

186
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,200
So you have got it, you have to have a commitment to one another.

187
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,600
There.

188
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,900
That's the first thing.

189
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
The second thing is, we commit.

190
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:55,600
So we spend 90 minutes together as a — leadership team every single week, and we reserve 20 minutes of that 90 minutes every single week to do, what we call a check in.

191
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,700
Now, some might be what as a mental health check in.

192
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:11,100
I kind of view it as that, but it's also to a check in to understand where people are in their station and place in life At that moment in that week because it does change day to day and it changes by week to week.

193
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,600
And so we asked you question and I got this from another leader.

194
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,400
This is not Tamika Smith.

195
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:24,200
I actually stole it from a person that I reported to, but it was so fascinating to me and how well he was able to build a strong team.

196
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,100
But as two questions and the questions are, what is your energy for the job?

197
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
And what's your stress?

198
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,300
Your level of stress, be it outside or inside, right?

199
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,600
Because the fact of the matter is, there are polarities in life, right?

200
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,300
What goes up must come down, right?

201
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,500
You pull, you pull one thing this way something, it's cooled and another Direction.

202
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,900
And so and that's on a scale of Loved one to ten energy for the job.

203
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:59,600
If someone writes it on a nine, but they're outside, stress is a 1, they're doing great, but great and their will, if they're willing to share why that week is going so great.

204
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:09,900
We are all happier to hear those stories because we want to share in the joy, but then there are opportunities are times and opportunities where someone will share that their energy for the job is a five.

205
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,600
And they're outside stresses and nine.

206
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,900
And that happened this past week.

207
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,700
We had someone on my leadership team who had a friend pass away.

208
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,600
34 years old suddenly, they weren't expecting it.

209
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,700
So you think about that?

210
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,900
What my team was able to do is to back off, right?

211
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:36,000
The things that we were asking for in the things that we thought are important At that moment that week is not important to him or weren't important to him in that week.

212
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,000
And so we backed off we let him have a space.

213
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:45,900
We let him die a lot of meetings early if you needed to or take a half of a day, the During that week because that was traumatic for him.

214
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,100
Yes, business.

215
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,400
Still needs to get done.

216
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,500
But he's an important member of our clan, and we recognize that.

217
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,100
And so it gives us an opportunity to be empathetic as an entire leadership team.

218
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:13,500
And so, what I am starting to see now is that are my leaders are doing that for their teams and then their managers are doing that for their teams, and we are becoming a more empathetic organization within just, the Virginia health plan.

219
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,700
Yeah, it's because I think that's important that you mentioned.

220
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,900
That just around the influence of the teams.

221
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,100
It starts with the leadership, right?

222
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:42,700
It starts the top starts with making conscious efforts to, to infuse empathy into the culture of the team and finding unique ways that to do that in ways that are, you know, feasible for your team, whether it's 90 minutes, whether it's 30, whether its individual check-ins, but prioritizing it as part of your leadership imperatives.

223
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,600
I It is absolutely crucial when you think about trying to inspire your people.

224
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,400
You're not and I just have to say this one last thing here we have to care about our people just as much as we care about our profits.

225
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,100
And when you do that, you're going to see profits rise, you have to care that much.

226
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,300
We spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to make more money how to make the process work.

227
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:18,100
We need to spend equal amount of time, trying to figure out how to keep our people happy and productive, and to make sure that they are right?

228
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,700
Because if they're right, the business will be right.

229
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,500
Yeah.

230
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,600
Powerful and the Tactical questions that can be asked.

231
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,500
I think I jotted it down and chat.

232
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:32,900
There.

233
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,500
What is your energy for the job?

234
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,100
What is your level of stress?

235
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,800
Those are some really good questions and you do it on a scale of one to ten random.

236
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,700
Got it.

237
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,500
That's great.

238
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
Wow, thank you for sharing all of that.

239
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,900
We got a bunch of questions that are getting a pop up in Q&A.

240
00:24:51,900 --> 00:25:01,700
I have one more question before we Jump over to Q&A, how has the pandemic changed your approach to empathetic leadership?

241
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:19,900
I think it's made as double-click on it, right for me at least because we you know, you here, you see the all these ads and all these right inputs, asking you to check in on your friends and family.

242
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,300
It's a mystery for work, right?

243
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:35,400
You have got to check in on people because you don't know what people are going through at times unless you ask and, and we have got to get out of the habit of and maybe we're already out of the habit of asking people how they're doing, but not actually stopping to listen to how they Do.

244
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,800
And to me, it's one of my biggest pet peeves, is someone will say how you do.

245
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,400
And before I can even finish their, like, asking me another question.

246
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,100
Like, did you care?

247
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:52,500
What if, what if I told you I wasn't doing so well, were you prepared to pause and listen to that?

248
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,800
And so, you know, I know we're going to talk about, we will probably get into this a little bit later.

249
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,700
But like, I miss being in the office for that.

250
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,800
Very reason, I really do.

251
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:11,100
I miss the water cooler conversations or the elevator comes Station or the, we're getting ready to leave the office conversation and oh, by the way, do you want to catch a drink Gina and London?

252
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,100
And I did that a lot this pencil.

253
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,300
We had it when we work together.

254
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,500
We had a really good time.

255
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:15,800
At least.

256
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,600
I think we did.

257
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,500
We had a great time, and we became more friends than we were co-workers.

258
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:32,100
I still talk to them on a regular, pretty consistent basis, and we check in with each other's families, but that's because of the team that we have in the relationship that we both with one another.

259
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Yeah, you haven't.

260
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,700
Had to make a, I think there's a difference in hearing versus listening, right?

261
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:48,200
And, and truly, making sure someone feels heard and taking that active effort to understand what someone is feeling and what they're going through often.

262
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,200
I have found that's more important than the work because the work is going to have to get done, right?

263
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,400
We're gonna all continue to drive the prophets, the process, the operations.

264
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:04,700
Otherwise, none of us will be in our positions on our roles in our companies or whatever, but I think what's cements the connection.

265
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
The Bomb the Loyalty.

266
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:14,500
The inspiration is taking that time and making it a part of your process to check on your people to follow through and I think that's another piece, right?

267
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:20,200
As it's one thing to pick up the phone and say or walk see somebody walking down the hall or on a meeting to how's your day?

268
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:28,800
And then I will after you talked about five minutes, all those great to hear and then you don't talk to me again about anything about themselves for six months or three months later.

269
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,700
I am right.

270
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,500
So, really making that concerted, concerted effort, and, you know, I will say that.

271
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,500
What we don't think about, as it relates to that, is that often, that's hard, right?

272
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:53,500
Sometimes it's hard to get out of your, your go, go, you know, Roadrunner focus and work or lives to stop and engage deeply with someone else and or multiple people or multiple folks on your team.

273
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:00,200
So, so you ask the original question of how, you know, has a pandemic influenced, my leadership style around that.

274
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,800
I have made it a priority to put time on my calendar, every week to check on.

275
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,400
A couple of people and they may be different.

276
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
It may be an email.

277
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
It may be 15 minutes, Hutch point.

278
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:19,000
But really making that part of the calendar, just like you do your workouts, just like you do your meditation or your, you know, your QB ours or sprs.

279
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,800
You got to put up a part of your calendar says, check on your people this week.

280
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,100
It's going to be X y&z or this area or these five.

281
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:34,400
I think that's really important and it goes a long way for the culture of your team and building a true empathetic culture.

282
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,700
Check on your people.

283
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I have to say, I have been something, I have been something.

284
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,600
I think two things, one, you know, to be curious.

285
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,400
I might like came first and your Frontline leaders.

286
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,800
I think I want to touch on that.

287
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,300
And then, second on making time.

288
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:57,500
They both of you guys have, clearly articulated are the importance of actually caring and making time.

289
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:16,200
And not just like the check the box, how you do a response on the management for I think that, you know, for us to have the opportunity to read readers, I think leaders in the season need a little bit more double-clicking and check ins than we typically.

290
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:23,400
I think our Frontline leaders are typically the ones that carry the weight of the company, but also carry the weight of your vehicle at the same time.

291
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:29,400
All right, so it's like not only do you hear all the needs of the business but you also hear the needs of your people.

292
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,600
And the question is, who's checking on you and that's become very clear to me as a leader in my core.

293
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:45,000
Team is like, how is My core team doing because Vex I think love that you said this, if they're not doing well, nothing, nothing else matters because they're going to be the leaders that are meeting 14th.

294
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,600
Right?

295
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,900
I think that's become really clear to me.

296
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:54,600
And then I think the second thing on how has it changed with remote image or distributed.

297
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,300
I think it's just we're not bumping into each other to make it like you said, right?

298
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,200
We're not seeing that person that's checked out, or we're not seeing that person.

299
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
That feels down.

300
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,000
You're not picking up on the body language.

301
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,100
No.

302
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:24,700
So that means that we have to be almost like so in tune with like how people are showing up on slack on an email, one word that they said that was maybe out of character or there's a lot that goes into like that level of communication.

303
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,700
The question is as leaders.

304
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,800
Are we going to make Tom?

305
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,200
I am just this happened to me very recently, an employee's hear something.

306
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,100
And I was traveling, and I was in the Bay Area and my calendar stacked.

307
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,000
And I am like, you know what, this is a very important conversation and Instead of jumping on a quick 5-minute call.

308
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:49,100
I am a punt this to like a week and a half later where I know there's going to be a window for an unlimited window of time.

309
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,200
And the question becomes, how am I going to clear?

310
00:30:52,200 --> 00:31:00,600
My calendar for 23 hours, whatever it is to really listen to a key player on your team so that you can answer questions.

311
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,900
So you can dig into the layers of complexities that a person might be going through and make space.

312
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,600
And I think that's crazy talk.

313
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:18,000
When you're a busy CEO and the leader and say hold on, you're going to block out that time and I think that's the level of attention we have to do, especially in a remote world to say, you know what?

314
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,600
Yes, the ten minute.

315
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,100
All is not going to be enough.

316
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:26,800
I have to clear my calendar at a certain point, but I'ma give you the space in the time, so we can dig in together.

317
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,500
And I think that's something that I am learning as a leader of distributed Workforce is the intention that comes with making space and checking in on your people.

318
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,900
Yeah, and I can, I just add one thing is when you mentioned leaders, here's what I would also add.

319
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,500
This is a plug for me you and London like so check on your leaders.

320
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,500
Yeah.

321
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,100
Yes.

322
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,600
People check on your leader.

323
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:04,700
Like it is rather Lonely at the Top and the you don't have a lot of people within your organization checking on you white there.

324
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,400
Assume that you got it right there.

325
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:12,000
Assuming that you're at the wheel, you got it, but when someone does call, it's kind of, its kind of weird.

326
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,200
You have to like, adjust your thoughts, your license, ask how you're doing.

327
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,300
You're like, okay, but that's how Also to build rapport and you build relationship, right?

328
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,400
Not a lot of people are checking on us.

329
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,100
Yeah, it goes back to this analogy.

330
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:35,000
If you're driving the bus or driving the ship and you're the captain, right and you're driving all day, all night, who's coming to the front, it to say, how are you doing?

331
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,500
Or can you take can we do something for you?

332
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:47,300
I think you touched on it, you know, around this idea of paying attention, and I am an expressive texture and Communicator often.

333
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,400
I use a lot of emojis for that very reason.

334
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,900
I really do believe in it, you know, some always send a smiley face or thumbs up or something funny.

335
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So most people know how I am feeling or know that I am engaged when you get a one word text for me or you get, you know, a very short response either.

336
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,400
I am super busy or not in it, right?

337
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:22,100
You gotta pay attention to those little things to your point around emails and communication, and then also respecting other people's Styles and it goes back to as a leader, just being in tuned and making that a priority.

338
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,600
Such Rich nuggets shared by you all.

339
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Wow, it's almost like every Emoji, every response.

340
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
There could be a double-click, you know, into that.

341
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,700
And Roberto is Infamous for the double-click, you know, which is awesome and needed in this time.

342
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:58,300
And, so I think as Leaders we could be mindful of like, okay, wait, you know, know the norms and habits of each of your employees and if something's a little off, like, they're not, but not that, The Emoji like they normally do, or they're not responding with a thumbs up.

343
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,600
Let me double-click into that.

344
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,000
What's going on there?

345
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,300
You know, I think that's really important and it goes both ways.

346
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,900
It's not only managers to their direct reports.

347
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,600
But management.

348
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,100
Let us do that for our leaders.

349
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:13,199
Let us check in with our bosses.

350
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,600
All right.

351
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,000
Well, we have got a ton of great questions that are coming through.

352
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,400
So we're going to go through them and try to answer as many as we can.

353
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,000
And there are many times the highwomen Highest upvotes.

354
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,400
We have is with this first question.

355
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:35,000
How do you get a male-dominated leadership team to see the value of empathetic leadership?

356
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:44,800
And I think we have to be mindful of any gender dominated leadership because it could be a full female-dominated leadership team.

357
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,699
It could be a full male, right?

358
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:53,500
I think just knowing that when you have that kind of, you know, majority group.

359
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,600
Are we being Mindful and empathetic in our leadership?

360
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,900
Do you want to take that one?

361
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,100
Tamika, hey, I will go for it.

362
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:22,800
Well, you know, so the question, the way it was, it was originally proposed or posed made the assumption that men aren't as empathetic and maybe there's some truth in that, it has not been my experience.

363
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:30,900
For me, I do know that there are some people in general that just aren't empathetic and part of that too.

364
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,700
I don't, you know, I don't know if that's nature-nurture.

365
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,900
Like, are you born with it?

366
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,800
I don't know, but I think that's a debate that should be it.

367
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,200
That's it.

368
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,000
That's debatable in the topic in and of itself, but it hasn't, it hasn't been my experience for me.

369
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,700
I have tended to surround myself with and be surrounded by people that genuinely care about me as an individual.

370
00:35:53,700 --> 00:36:00,300
And when they don't I kind of step out because I can see the soup how superficial relationship is.

371
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:07,800
I have right now the best boss I have ever had and my life, and he's amazing.

372
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
He takes time.

373
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,800
He knows when to call me.

374
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,300
He allows me to say, exactly what's on my mind.

375
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,400
Even if it is not the right thing to say at the time.

376
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,400
And so, but you need that space to be able to do that.

377
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:36,900
And, so I, you know, I think you got to surround yourself and you got to know when to went to move on to because some of us think that we have got to stay on a team, got to take what's dished out and you don't you have choices in life.

378
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,200
You choose every single day, you're going to brush your teeth.

379
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,200
If you're gonna put one foot in front of the other you make choices.

380
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:51,000
And if you're on a team where you're not feeling that you're getting what you need you have an opportunity to leave that team.

381
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,300
Go somewhere else.

382
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:58,300
Take Your gifts elsewhere because sometimes it might, it might not be the place or the space for you.

383
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,900
And that's okay.

384
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,700
It's okay that it's not the end of the world when it doesn't work out.

385
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,500
It's good.

386
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,200
It's good.

387
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,300
I think, I think this is a, it's a I mean, powerful question, right?

388
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:20,500
I think there's a lot of layers in this question as well, and we can parse have an entire session with a much more qualified panel than me being on here.

389
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,800
But I think I need to get a high level.

390
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,600
I think, at a high level, it's me.

391
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,300
It's just speak to at the core of it is also diversity.

392
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:29,800
Right?

393
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:36,800
I think that if we're not talking about that as it relates to Teams and team build outs.

394
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,200
Then.

395
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,600
I think there's going to be an imbalance of perspectives.

396
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,700
And so, regardless of male Dominator or not.

397
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:48,200
I think it's also how the versus the thinking a representation of that team and that company.

398
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,100
And how does that then drive empathetic leadership?

399
00:37:52,200 --> 00:38:05,200
And I think, I mean, when I, when I think about like, you know, one of my mentors has this core concept that you she's he's always, I don't have his first term is I got my mentors that are women powerful women, which is awesome.

400
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:16,200
But he's an investor, and she says, you know what, I want to hear your distance, traveled story, which really is like regardless of, what your resume say, or you always have what school you went to.

401
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,500
I want to hear your story, your life Journey.

402
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,000
Have you been through some hard times?

403
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:33,600
My tell me about the hard times you have been in and I think like having a team that naturally has been through some hard times and a crazy distance travel story just leads to just having more empathetic leadership as well because you had the fight.

404
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,700
You have to like climb walls and Hunker down, you had to overcome some things in life.

405
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,000
And I think that should build you to be a bit more empathetic as well.

406
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,500
Roberta.

407
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,300
So, if though, that if, and I am thinking about this in my head and out loud right now, so, we're in the moment.

408
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:57,500
But I also wonder if authenticity could be a catalyst for empathy, right?

409
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:03,900
Because the more authentic, I have been bringing my whole self to work whether people like it or not.

410
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,400
Like this is who I am.

411
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,800
And, you know, not a lot of going to change at this point.

412
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,500
I mean, I am I can work on it, but I am who I am and my core.

413
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:19,700
Bringing my whole self to work, has paid more dividends for me than anything else.

414
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:30,300
And I think it's given people the license or the opportunity to care about me as an individual because they know about me as a person, right?

415
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:38,600
So, I used to be afraid to tell people that I started out my career while I was on Medicaid, a mother on Medicaid, right?

416
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,700
And now I am leading Medicaid.

417
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,700
I should share that.

418
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,300
Story.

419
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:49,300
And now I am sharing that story and people are seeing themselves in me.

420
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:56,000
And so now, right when I have an issue, when I talk to them about, what's going on with my family and some of these stories are unbelievable people.

421
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,600
Can they can identify with that?

422
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:06,700
And, so I think that authenticity can be a path to yeah, opening up that.

423
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,100
Absolutely no one.

424
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,100
I mean and you can we can talk about this.

425
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:17,100
I mean, I know we probably need to and But we have tried getting to Q&A but at a high level to make a I would say authenticity.

426
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:21,500
And just I think Aaron with that is with the given as Alpha born ability, right?

427
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,600
As Leaders bought a time.

428
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,300
We think that run ability is a weakness that the okay.

429
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:32,400
Yeah, that Us opening up and say, you know what, I have had a hard for, you know what, I am going through some crap in Life or you know what?

430
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,100
I don't know the answer to that, and I am going to be vulnerable.

431
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,600
I don't know the answer to that, but we're going to go figure it out.

432
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,600
In fact, we have the team to go figure that up and I think just being more vulnerable.

433
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:48,400
All also just allowed level of authenticity across teams that just makes you more human at the end of the day.

434
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
And I think that's what we're talking about here.

435
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,200
So I will double-click I am above you said because I think you guys you to hit that nail on the head.

436
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:07,500
And I think it goes back to this underlying kind of layer of the onion around the capacity for authenticity organizations of people that value authenticity, right?

437
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,700
And when you think about this idea that we have all been a part of organizations for a significant.

438
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:34,100
Of our time of our lives and time whether it's businesses, family, schools, social groups, and then when you're thinking about this idea of empathy, with in all of that, it comes down to, you know, language context culture, and having the want to understand it and end-to-end to Value it.

439
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:42,700
And to your point a second ago, your life Journey or your life travel and then Tomika bringing you're bringing your full and authentic self to the job you're in.

440
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:48,300
And people being able, not only to recognize that, see the value, and then bringing more of that.

441
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:59,300
And, and I think as Leaders, we owe it to our teams and our organizations to build that out and to continue to build that perspective and thought leadership and diversity.

442
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:12,700
And that, and you get into this up, this bigger concept of diversity, equity and inclusion, and he's thinking sympathies at the core, and I am seeing a lot of this, these themes across organizations across Industries.

443
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,300
And the importance of it.

444
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:21,500
The bigger we get as a world in a country and, you know, so on and it's important, right?

445
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,600
It's so important.

446
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,800
Well, you know, before we leave this, I do think we should talk about trust.

447
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,600
So I think important equation, right?

448
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,200
I think trust is huge.

449
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,700
Right and without it, you have nothing, right?

450
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,700
And it's in a marriage friendship or relationship with your boss, right?

451
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,900
With your customers, where people don't trust, you can't get very far.

452
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,400
And, so I think that there's a connection with empathy and Trust.

453
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:53,100
I like to take my teens through happiness training with an expert Rick Fox.

454
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:53,600
It's a wreck.

455
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,100
If you're out there.

456
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:54,800
I hope you're listening.

457
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,400
Love him.

458
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,600
Love his approach.

459
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,600
But he gave, he gives us when we go through this training, a trust formula, right?

460
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:11,700
And that trust formula is high levels of interaction, high levels of flexibility and high levels of disclosure.

461
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:20,800
And you think about that, any relationship that you value has those three components or ingredients in it, right?

462
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,100
You think about the bigger your closest friend, your wife?

463
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,100
Wife, your husband, your right, your parents, your brothers and sisters.

464
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,000
Those that you're closest to, you are flexible.

465
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
They know things about you that other people don't know.

466
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,500
And you spend a lot of time with them because you choose to.

467
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,900
And, so I think that trust and empathy are connected in that way in that vein.

468
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,400
And so when you put those things together, right?

469
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,900
Actually we might be building something around empathy, but it's like authenticity.

470
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,300
It's trust right?

471
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,100
You and You miss all those things together.

472
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,500
And I think empathy then comes along for the ride.

473
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,100
You say interaction, flexibility and disclosure.

474
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:09,300
What were the three high levels of flexibility high levels of Engagement and high levels of disclosure?

475
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,600
Equals trust awesome Mica.

476
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,100
I need to get this happiness training ASAP.

477
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:22,100
So we're going to have your friend is going to have a referral coming in really soon, because I need that in my life.

478
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,400
I think.

479
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,800
I think it's brilliant, especially again, tying it back to remote and distributed teams.

480
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:37,000
It's like, I think, you know, you're mentioning happiness training and for some people that vote on that sounds like from Mars somewhere, but no, it's like in this distributed world.

481
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,100
The intentionality just have to be so much more.

482
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,100
And water and having teams go through intentional, training on how to do this.

483
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,600
Well, especially when both teams.

484
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,000
It's fascinating.

485
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,400
So I guess we're talking The Green Room, so we can talk about that referral.

486
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:59,200
But before we go, next question, so you take, you take that trust for me line, you take all the depth that we just talked about.

487
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
Now you go say to me, go create a PowerPoint.

488
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:09,800
Now, you say now you say to your team, go get prepared for some business review, or go get prepared for something that in the grand scheme of what it is.

489
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,100
You're trying.

490
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:10,900
To accomplish.

491
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:22,200
Is it, is that big you'd be amazed how much you get done together when you build, you know, those High degrees of, trust disclosure partnership and understanding of each other.

492
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,600
When, when now the ask is, how can you lean in with me?

493
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,400
Can we do this together?

494
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,700
I am are you ready?

495
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,200
What support do you need that?

496
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,900
It's something fascinating when you get to that threshold and over that Hill.

497
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:50,800
And Roberto London can tell you, he's been through the training and it was, I mean, it's an experience and you can't unknow what you learn when you go to that, that did that programming that try that process.

498
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,400
You can't, you can't unknow it.

499
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,600
And so you're wet with it and you have to apply it because it's in your head.

500
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,400
So, that's the happiness training with Rick Foster.

501
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:11,000
Okay, and I mean, there is a question here in chat about leadership exercises to help improve empathy.

502
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,900
So would you take your whole leadership team?

503
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,000
Unlike an off-site?

504
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,200
And is this, like a whole day activity, or it's a two-day the way Rick does it?

505
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:27,700
It's a two-day investment in your leadership team, and he really talks to you about the realities and the science of what happy.

506
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:28,500
People do.

507
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,000
And so happy people behave and they do certain things.

508
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,800
There are certain things that they do in life because they're happy.

509
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:53,200
And then there's also two when your, when your team is happy, they are functioning from the executive level of their brain, which means that's the highest place of productivity, you can get from that team because they're high functioning there are high functioning teams.

510
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,700
And so as you think about, you think about that executive function, that's where we want.

511
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,200
Our people to be leading from is that executive function of their brain?

512
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,400
And then when you do that, there's these other components of Happiness, like, showing appreciation.

513
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:08,900
I mean, you got to think about it.

514
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,400
How often do you tell someone?

515
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:19,200
I really appreciate it, but you did for me or I appreciate you, staying late on that meeting, or appreciate you stand up to 2:00 in the morning to work on that deck, whatever it is.

516
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,700
But it's you got to show real appreciation for people, and they have to feel it here.

517
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,600
It can't be superficial but that's something that You people do is they show appreciation.

518
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,300
They show humility.

519
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,600
They focus around intention rights.

520
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:44,100
If you think about when people harm you, you got to ask yourself the question about that individuals intention, right?

521
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:48,800
And so, you can forgive people if their intention wasn't to harm you.

522
00:47:49,600 --> 00:48:16,700
Now, if their intention was to harm you, that is a whole nother ball of wax dealing with something totally different, but he takes us, he will take your Teams through all of that exercise, to help, you understand what happy people do, how they function, how they engage and whatnot, and how to recognize when you have or likely might have someone on your team, that is intentionally causing people harm because hurt, people hurt people.

523
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,800
Mmm, so good.

524
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,600
All right, let us talk to you before.

525
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,500
Before we leave this.

526
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,900
We're going to have, like, happiness workshop on.

527
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,900
Welcome for Distributing.

528
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,300
Yeah.

529
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,300
Like that's like the next event.

530
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:37,800
We have to get going, love that and I think somebody in chat was asking, you know, is there a happiness index or test that we can take?

531
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,800
We're going.

532
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,700
We're going to do it on a walk on, so we can do it all together.

533
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,200
Okay?

534
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:42,700
Yeah.

535
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Well Rick Foster on, I love it.

536
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,000
Alright, here's another question.

537
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:53,200
How do you scale empathetic leadership as your team and as your company grows?

538
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,400
I think you.

539
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,200
You stay true.

540
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:58,800
The formula.

541
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:06,700
Whatever that formula is for your team, right in the end, wherever you have seen that most success and obviously, you know, to make is mentioning the happiness formula.

542
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,200
I am sure there're others, you know, that have worked specific to Industries or what it is.

543
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,200
You're trying to accomplish as you scale.

544
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:21,500
Not only do you have to make sure that you're staying true to that formula, but you are evolving it over time for scalability, right?

545
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:26,400
Whether that's more resources or that's more in time that you use dedicated to it.

546
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:37,700
When you go from A Thousand person company or 500 person company to have 50,000 person company, you will notice the infrastructure around people and the infrastructure around programs and diversity, inclusion.

547
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,500
Just simple networking or teaching gross, right?

548
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:50,500
It's no longer one person to maybe five, maybe ten, maybe different groups and organizations and then you create the Matrix around that.

549
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:57,300
But I would say, you know, from my experiences, you know, scaling that empathy empathetic culture and Leadership.

550
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,500
Aisle and, you know, kind of anchor, you got it State Route.

551
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,400
It has to be a priority, has to be measured.

552
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,300
It has to be a priority.

553
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:04,500
Right?

554
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,300
What's measured gets done and it gets done.

555
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:07,700
Well.

556
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:10,800
Good point.

557
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:17,000
I think for me I go back to interviewing like when your interview especially like a leader in your organization.

558
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:26,200
Your leaders can be responsible for people and so having the wrong higher that's coming in and is responsible for driving culture and building people up.

559
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,200
I mean, it's become so much more important, right?

560
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:39,300
So, the interviewing process that you have, I think Linda back to your point that interviewing formula is making sure that you don't lower the bar.

561
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:44,100
You're very people consider company and what you're bringing company, people consider the company for.

562
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,100
I think a lot of times we get into these pressure pocket.

563
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,500
Sometimes we were just, I just need someone to come in and kind of.

564
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,800
Yes, they check all the boxes on the resume, they do all of this.

565
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,700
But how are you actually double-clicking to kind of hammer that one home on the person?

566
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,400
Can I really trust this person to lead people?

567
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:12,600
Well, and I just hold my leader so a higher bar because at the end, Of the day, they're the ones building culture with their teams.

568
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:12,800
Right?

569
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,900
So I am only a successful as I am able to influence my reader.

570
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And so bringing the Right leader in and carry that culture further is, I think we're starts again at let me touch on that as well.

571
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,100
None of this is easy.

572
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,100
Right?

573
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,300
Well, let us be clear, right?

574
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:42,900
None of this, this thinking and these approaches, and the framework is easy, and it gets harder, especially the bigger you get, and the more diverse you get as an organization, and I am a firm believer in.

575
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:50,000
Not one size, fits all and I think that's one of the biggest challenges that we have as big companies and, you know, different Industries.

576
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,800
We try to take these Frameworks at ideas and Concepts and just layer it on and do this.

577
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:07,200
You have to find the Formula that works for your team, your direct team, and your broader organization, and you have to solicit the inspiration and to buy into it.

578
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:13,200
So I will just I will leave that because I don't want people to think that we're just saying this and it's, you know, snap of a finger.

579
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,500
But this takes work.

580
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,600
It takes alignment.

581
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,200
It takes time.

582
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:23,000
It takes energy takes measurement takes investment, and it's important to think about it holistically in that way.

583
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,300
I agree.

584
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:25,900
You know what?

585
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,100
I think it's around.

586
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,500
I think it's around intention.

587
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,400
Right?

588
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:40,900
And so for people that have children, you will this will resonate our kids do as we do not necessarily as we say, right?

589
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,800
And sometimes kids are like, huh?

590
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:44,800
That's me.

591
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,000
That is me off every day.

592
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,300
And it's interesting.

593
00:52:49,300 --> 00:53:02,200
They do more of what you do than what you say because and most times We're saying things, we have to say it a thousand times, but when you're doing something right, that's easier to adopt because it becomes habit.

594
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:11,600
And, so I think it's around and tension and around making sure that you were modeling the way and calling it out when you don't see it because that's important too, right?

595
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,900
Sometimes we, you know, people do something wrong or something terrible and will whisper behind the scenes.

596
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,900
Like did you believe did you hear you?

597
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:19,500
No, no.

598
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,100
No.

599
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,800
We need to call those bad behaviors out, but we should also too.

600
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,700
Call out in a good way.

601
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:31,400
The behaviors that we see and model those, and make sure that we're being intentional about that.

602
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,400
So I want to double-click into that Tomika.

603
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,700
How do you do it in honoring and respectful way?

604
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,900
I think it's about Tak tone and timing, right?

605
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,800
So it's about when you do it, so I will give an example of something that happened today.

606
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
So this is like I am sharing, right?

607
00:53:50,800 --> 00:54:06,100
Like some of my baggage life is not perfect and especially in leadership, but I joined a call today and I had a member of my staff was saying well sometimes our leader doesn't give clear directions, but they didn't know that.

608
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:06,800
I was on the call.

609
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,100
So it's not helped myself.

610
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,800
I could not help us up because it was like, I was Shocked rapidly.

611
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,200
Wait what?

612
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,300
So then I was like, you know, running through my email, the figure like was I not clear?

613
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,100
And so and I just asked them in the moment and that particular point in time.

614
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:28,200
There were few of us on the call for me to say what was not clear.

615
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,300
Like, like talking about this, talk about it right.

616
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:30,600
Now.

617
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,100
What were you not clear on and oh, by the way, if you're not clear, please call me text me.

618
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:41,700
I am all this, and we dealt with literally At that moment and but I am an in-the-moment time.

619
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,100
I believed her London knows this, right?

620
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,500
Right, then it was it.

621
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,600
I am telling you that day.

622
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,600
I can't sleep on it.

623
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:57,000
Like I literally cannot take it to bed with me, if there's something awry, I have to talk to you about it that day before I close my eyes.

624
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,300
I can't let it Fester you, let things Fester.

625
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:10,700
They actually get worse than they were when you originally encountered it like you start overthinking it, you start processing, and you start adding on your own stuff to it, but I think it has a lot to do with timing.

626
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,900
So And so you do that as it's comfortable for you, right?

627
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,600
So if you're an in-the-moment type of person deal with it, then move on.

628
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:27,900
If you're not process, take I know some folks like to process things, process it and then it sometimes it really involved.

629
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,900
You pull a person to the side and having a separate conversation because, guess what?

630
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,500
No one likes to be embarrassed.

631
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,700
None of us are who, like, who are signing up for embarrassment every day?

632
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,500
Not me.

633
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,700
I don't wanna be embarrassed, that's part of what drives me to, to succeed.

634
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,000
In the world is to not fail, definitely not be embarrassed.

635
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,500
And so, none of us likes to feel that way.

636
00:55:47,500 --> 00:56:01,500
And so, it's a matter of making sure that you're doing it and honoring, the person with their, with respect, right, giving them, the respect that they're done and doing it in a safe space and, and Tomika, I think the asterisk there.

637
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,500
You know what you just said?

638
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,800
Is that you care, right?

639
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:11,700
You care as a leader, and you want to make sure that if someone doesn't feel like they brought up to speed up their brought up to speed, or there's something missing that you want to address it.

640
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,100
And you know, there's lots of ways to do it.

641
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,400
Like you said, it's in the moment.

642
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:24,800
It's taking them to the side, but I think it goes back to, you know, Tak tone and timing and then this idea of like the language you use the context in which you're communicating right in the culture.

643
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,200
Right?

644
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:33,600
I mean, everyone is engaged differently, everyone receives information differently and received criticism attention.

645
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:33,900
Right?

646
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,700
Like you're exactly that person.

647
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:36,900
Are you?

648
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:44,200
Absolutely and I think that's a really powerful element of Leadership is being aware and cognizant of that.

649
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,300
And to me, that's empathy, right.

650
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,400
That's a version of empathy in the moment in an instance.

651
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:55,200
And you know, that is something that I hate to say, it is not something that you're born with.

652
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:17,900
I mean the reality is, you learn that over time, you learn that, their experiences, you learn that through, you know, going through the battles, you learn that through managing and leading different types of people and working with different groups of people, to build up that skill set and ability to deliver that message or Support that colleague or whatever it is At that moment in time, but you got again, it's not easy.

653
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,100
You have to pay attention.

654
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,800
You have to be engaged as a leader that has to be a priority of yours.

655
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,800
Otherwise, you just you're just a driver, you just hate, you know, just drive and push it.

656
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,100
I know we're running on time, but I have to say this.

657
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,600
I like to consider it like, spinach in my teeth, right?

658
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:35,900
Yes.

659
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,700
Spinach in your teeth.

660
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:45,400
You want someone to tell you that you have to walk around at a party with the you care about the person.

661
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,600
Tell him, tell him what's right?

662
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,100
And what's wrong?

663
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,400
That's good.

664
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:57,600
I, you know, before we wrap up here, I just gotta say, both Tomika in London that I don't know.

665
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,800
I think, Two guys are doing is pretty powerful.

666
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,700
Not only you lead distributed teams, but it's super teams in healthcare.

667
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:08,200
And I mean, when we talk about taking care of people, empathetic leadership is important.

668
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,600
Overall well-being is as important, right?

669
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:20,500
So anyway, I just want to thank you to before we run out of time here for just sharing the stage and sharing best practices that you are seeing on your thigh.

670
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,200
And thank you.

671
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,500
Thank you for your leadership and your leadership in the tech space and doing what you're doing.

672
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,300
You're In the game and you're doing it, right?

673
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:39,400
You're doing it better, and we can all see that and so appreciate having the opportunity just to be on a panel with you next to the greatness.

674
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,400
So really appreciate that.

675
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:49,700
Yeah, you better share the stage with you three and it's been a, it's been a privilege and hopefully this has helped folks that were listening in today.

676
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,200
And if there's anything you need, let us know.

677
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:59,200
Wow, I am like feeling the love wrapping up at time here.

678
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:09,500
And I know we didn't get through all of the questions, but this was so rich and there were some tactical takeaways some really meaningful insights shared.

679
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,100
I hope all of you took something away.

680
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,400
We will be sharing this recording out to all those who had registered.

681
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,200
And so thank you, Tomika London.

682
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,000
Roberto.

683
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,100

684
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,200
Thank you, Gina.

685
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,600
Thank you guys.

686
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,300
All right.

687
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:33,900
Well with that, we are going to wrap up and gosh.

688
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,000
After these rich conversations.

689
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:42,500
I wish that we could all like, hang out at the bar and go grab a drink together and chill out.

690
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,700
But, you know, we hope to see you at our next event.

691
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:52,000
We have got an event coming up, May 31st, and it's going to be an internal comms focused event.

692

Take care.

1
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:42,981
Get the right message at the right time and making sure that it's accessible to both people at home and in our offices.

2
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,281
As an internal comms leader.

3
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:20,081
It's really important to me in building our hybrid Workforce that there's a consistency to when people receive information.

4
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:21,581
They know when they're going to get it.

5
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,381
It's accessible to both people at home and virtually.

6
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:55,881
It's really important to me is providing consistency for employees.

7
00:01:55,881 --> 00:02:02,381
So, creating and communicating, clear, and simple standards across the team.

8
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:05,881
No matter what function, or we're in the organization.

9
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:06,581
They work from.

1
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,300
Hi everyone.

2
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,000
Welcome to today's event.

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,800
My name is Gina, I am head of marketing with welcome, and we are so excited about today's panel.

4
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:38,700
We are talking today about onboarding and especially with remote teams there is this magic window that either makes or breaks an employee experience as well as their commitment and loyalty to a company.

5
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,700
And so we have got Laura from Sora.

6
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,700
And Craig from my Avant who's gonna help us dissect and dive deep into some of these insights.

We're going to kick it off this morning.

17
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,800
Well for me.

18
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,700
I am in Oahu Hawaii.

19
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,400
I am seeing some of you tuning in.

20
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,700
We got you sip from Turkey, Canada.

21
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,700
All right, we're all over La.

22
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,800
This is great.

23
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,500
So we're going to kick it off this morning with a pole.

24
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,600
What is your biggest onboarding challenge?

25
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,100
Feel free to drop your boats.

26
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:07,100
Is it frustrating manual processes, a lack of Engagement scaling as the company grows onboarding remotely or stakeholder accountability?

27
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,500
Go ahead and drop in your votes.

28
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,800
All right, we're starting to see them come through.

29
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,000
Lack of Engagement, onboarding remotely, stakeholder accountability.

30
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,200
That's coming up a lot.

31
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Then next is.

32
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,400
Okay.

33
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,400
Leveling out onboarding, remotely and stakeholder accountability.

34
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
All right.

35
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,100
Okay.

36
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,300
That's very insightful.

37
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,000
Thank you.

38
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
We're going to pick our panelists.

39
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,600
And so with that, I would love to introduce to our stage.

40
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:45,400
Laura co-founder and CEO of skoura And Craig Executive Director people operations and analytics of my Avant.

41
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,900
Hello, hello.

42
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,800
Hello to see you both.

43
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,400
Where are you tuning in from?

44
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
I am in LA and seasoning.

45
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,600
Great! Tiny red.

46
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,700
How about you Netherlands?

47
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:03,900
Netherlands.

48
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,900
Wow, we are truly across the globe.

49
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,800
I am in Hawaii.

50
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,800
So It's great to have you here on our stage, and I am very excited about this topic.

51
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,000
Some of the poll results that we just saw were identifying some challenges.

52
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,300
Are those some common challenges that you normally see?

53
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,600
What are your thoughts to that?

54
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,800
Yeah, it's not gonna be able to talk this whole time.

55
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,700
Yeah, honestly.

56
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,800
Very, very common.

57
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,600
Everything from manual processes.

58
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,600
We here to engaging stakeholders especially hiring managers.

59
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,100
We hear that a lot, a lot.

60
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
And what was the other one?

61
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,100
That one?

62
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,200
Remind me, I am boarding.

63
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,500
Remotely engagement remotely.

64
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:51,900
Yes.

65
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,800
Yes, of course.

66
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,900
You know that all the time will always will continue to be a question, a very A common question.

67
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,800
But especially obviously with covid has been very topical.

68
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,300
Yeah, I would, I would agree.

69
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:16,800
I sometimes think were in our own world and doing with their own challenges and then when you pull up and you have discussions like this, we're all dealing with the same things and I do think in some ways.

70
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:31,600
Stakeholder accountability has spiked a little bit more in recent years just because we're working a little bit more virtually and I know we will get into this a little bit later but things like the Buddy program that you set up new hires with.

71
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:40,500
Those are things that are been always Balance with trying to Tinker with to make sure that individual is creating the best experience for new hires.

72
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,500
That's good.

73
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,800
Oh, I am excited.

74
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:53,500
I have been to some of this but before we do jump into the questions can you tell us a little bit about each of your organization's and what kind of problems you all are solving?

75
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,400
Yeah, sure, yeah.

76
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,400
So as of three weeks ago, I was with my event Sciences, but I am now a free agent.

77
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:15,400
And in fact, this trip that I am on in Europe, it was one reason I actually left, and I am thinking about extending my trip in Europe for a couple months.

78
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:22,100
But when I was with my event, I was head of people operations and analytics.

79
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,700
So we did a lot of the onboarding The off-boarding.

80
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:39,100
We also had responsibility for the full technology stack as well as benefits and then since we were small we would also get involved in the programs like, you know, return to site or the employee survey or Performance Management.

81
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,300
And I am Laura, co-founder and CEO of Sora.

82
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:59,900
We are an employee onboarding platform that helps you create really powerful employee experiences, but do so at scale automating a lot of the tedious pieces and doing it with a human touch.

83
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:09,200
So seeing a lot, a lot of companies, onboarding processes, and trying to sort of optimize them and have lots of thoughts on the topic.

84
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,300
That's great.

85
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:22,500
All right, so we're going to dive into some of these questions that were submitted in advance, but also questions that we sort of came up with as we were in discussions together as a group prior to this event.

86
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,200
You know, we when we think about that magic window that we're just taught, what I was mentioning, there's actually a stat from sure.

87
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,300
I am that says, like, you know if you do onboarding well then 69% of your employees will actually stay.

88
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:43,600
So from day one, what are some really great Ways that we can engage our new hire.

89
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:59,200
Yeah, so I think that you sent this even ahead of time and one of the emails promoting this event but I think it's a really big question to sort of unpack.

90
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:09,900
So I like to take the word engage new hire and break it down a little bit and I think there's four main goals in engaging a new hire.

91
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,700
One is just getting them excited.

92
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:21,200
Of course like a good first impression is the first thing that happens and it's most important one is introduction.

93
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:35,300
Helping them understand the team and their contributions, and their goals, like introducing them to what work at your company, will be integration where they're actually meeting people.

94
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:44,200
And I always refer to this stat, where referred employees are much more successful on average than non referred employees.

95
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,400
And it's not because, you know, of course, it's not that rich people who are referred happened to be smarter than others.

96
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:57,900
It's because they have someone they can go to ask silly questions to ask where they should be finding information.

97
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:05,200
And so our goal should be to shorten that Gap and eliminate the Gap entirely so that everyone feels integrated enough.

98
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,300
Where they know where to go for questions with a know where to go for information.

99
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,400
So that integration goal I think is very important as well.

100
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,100
And finally fourth way I think of Engagement is ramp like actually getting them.

101
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,800
Up to speed and set up for success for their actual role.

102
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:42,100
And the skills that they need to develop etcetera, oftentimes that's dependent on teams and all kinds of other things, but excitement, introduction and integration are all things that as people team we can be doing to.

103
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,400
We can be influencing in our onboarding processes.

104
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,300
That's great.

105
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,200
So I will go ahead, Craig.

106
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,100
Oh no.

107
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:59,100
I was only going to say we often find new hires have that excitement when they first join.

108
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:10,800
So we really try to focus on what Laura described as the end of introduction integration in a ramp and doing that very well, and we can get into some of those details here in the moment.

109
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:19,300
So just to summarize those four points again it's excitement, introduction integration and ramp.

110
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,700
Those are the Is, I think it's easiest to break down and honestly there are 50 more.

111
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:32,700
There are so many goals we could have during onboarding, but I think they mostly can be broken down into those themes.

112
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:41,200
And then, what I typically do when I am helping someone with an onboarding process is for every single one of those goals.

113
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Think about what you are doing before they start when they start and a few weeks months after they start.

114
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,100
And it just makes it a little easier to break down your process and see.

115
00:15:51,200 --> 00:16:01,700
Where you have gaps and where you can fill in, you know, as managers we traditionally here that onboarding window is around 30 60 90, would you sit days?

116
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,200
Would you agree to that?

117
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Or does it continue before or less than that?

118
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Like, what is that?

119
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,400
Sweet spot of truly engaging an employee.

120
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:24,900
I do think a little bit before is important to acknowledge having a point of contact having someone on our marketing team, actually published a couple days ago.

121
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,200
30 questions that your new hire is probably too scared to ask you.

122
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:44,100
There are a lot of questions that need answering some that we aren't anticipating like a lot of our employees asked what they should wear even though we're a fully distributed company and I never would have thought of that like I am wearing a sweater.

123
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,500
Zoom right now.

124
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
We're on welcome, excuse me.

125
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,400
But yeah, I think there are a lot of things.

126
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:58,800
There's a lot of Engagement that needs to happen before the start date to get ready for that.

127
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,400
Excitement to get ready for that ramp Etc.

128
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,900
What do you think?

129
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,099
I know I think that's actually a really good example.

130
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:21,000
We often find that many of our new hires overdressed, the first couple days and to your point, I think they're really trying to understand the Norms of the organization and often.

131
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:28,000
You don't really pick up on a lot of those Norms until you start sort of working with people seeing how other people work.

132
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:43,100
And so, sometimes we take these things for granted, but I do think there's a lot of value in having that resource, perhaps even the recruiter helping with some of those questions, may even prompt some of those questions in advance, just so that the new hire doesn't feel like they're dumb questions.

133
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,700
That's a really good one.

134
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What should I wear?

135
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:56,800
Great answer to provide a new hire before day one, and they're honestly dozens more like that.

136
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,100
You can't see your calendar.

137
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Yet what does my first week look like?

138
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,600
I have no idea what I am walking into there's a lot.

139
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,000
A lot of things you can be doing to prep but then to the other half of your question how long does onboarding extend afterwards?

140
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:21,700
I do think 90 days is a good best practice but honestly The onboarding team, the HR team should be kind of constantly in touch with employees and onboarding.

141
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:28,700
Buddy doesn't have to stop talking to this person after 90 days, you know, ideally, they have actually formed a connection, and they continue to meet.

142
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:50,600
So when Should you evaluate those four goals of onboarding and how you can integrate that into your process 90 days is probably a good boundary to set their but the thoughtfulness should absolutely continue for pretty much the entire tenure of the employee.

143
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,500
Well, then are our onboarding process has certainly evolved over the years.

144
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,100
One thing we did last year, and I am sure many are familiar on this call or this webinar.

145
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:17,200
We actually ran an organizational network analysis, which essentially is a map of all the connections and who people are connected to it's like really doing an x-ray of your organization.

146
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,200
That's cool.

147
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,000
What we found was as you.

148
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:26,800
Imagine new hires don't have nearly the number of connections as more tenured employees.

149
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
That's very normal.

150
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,700
But we actually lagged the benchmarks.

151
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,800
So prior to that we actually would focus more on working with the manager on.

152
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,600
What are the projects, how do you get them?

153
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:53,200
Ramped up very quickly and what we pivoted to was trying to actually get the new hire focus more on the relationship building and it's hard because I think the new hire Comes in, and they want to prove themselves.

154
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:00,100
We really try to say it's not about that at this stage, you're here, and we have hired you for a reason.

155
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:21,000
So we started to do a lot more meet and greets, some of our new hires will facilitate up to 60 plus meet and greets and that may sound overwhelming, but we often get really good feedback because when you get individuals talking one-on-one with individuals that's when you're really going to pick up on.

156
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,000
Code, what does that person do?

157
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,500
What are some of those Norms?

158
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:37,500
So we try to get the new hire to slow down in the beginning, and really focus on just take a be, you know, focus on some of this new hire paperwork at your benefit sorted out.

159
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,900
Yes, you're probably going to have one or two projects from your manager, you can begin working on those.

160
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,900
But let us really invest them in getting to know people.

161
00:20:47,400 --> 00:21:06,200
And the other thing we got a lot of traction with is even some of the ongoing meetings that happen, weekly, and monthly just involving new hires in those and even though they have no role when they start to observe the other more tenured employees that really I think integrates them very, very quickly.

162
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,000
That's interesting.

163
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,200
I wanted to touch again.

164
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,900
The visual x-ray of the organization.

165
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,300
Can you what is that?

166
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,200
Like how do you even pull a visual x-ray of?

167
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,000
Is it like relationship Network?

168
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,500
What exactly is that x-ray?

169
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:54,400
So the primary set of connections, we mapped is through what we call, stakeholder feedback, which we run on an annual basis and what that process looks like, is each employee can nominate up to five individuals to get feedback from and then their manager can review those add maybe delete connections, and then we also later in the reporting hierarchy and from that you can really build out this entire map of whose connected?

170
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,200
Who's not, who's far away from each other future State?

171
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:09,800
We want to layer in more of the passive data such as like email, such as like chat messages, not in a big brother way.

172
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,400
We have no interest in the content of that.

173
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,500
We're just trying to understand how the organization is working.

174
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,300
Like whom are your influencers, who are your hubs, who are your Brokers?

175
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,300
And it's all with this focus on really getting new hires.

176
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,200
Ingrained very quickly and having a healthy Network so that communication is working.

177
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,600
Very seamlessly.

178
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,500
It's fascinating.

179
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:40,200
If I wanted to do an x-ray of my org like what tool or how do you go back to do that?

180
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:52,300
Oh gosh, I couldn't speak more highly of a tool called poly node, which they're based in Australia, the CEO is so Hands-On.

181
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,400
Amazing.

182
00:22:53,500 --> 00:23:01,700
And we also use lattice for our Performance Management, and they recently built out an API that seamlessly connects with that.

183
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,500
So it's all just plug and play very quickly and it's very cost.

184
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,700
Efficient to, these are not heavy resource type projects.

185
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,600
Get to know.

186
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,300
Awesome.

187
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,600
All right, so another question that we have is scaling onboarding depending on company size.

188
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,300
So obviously, when you're a smaller company, there's a lot of personal touch that you can offer at that point.

189
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:43,800
But as a company grows from 50 to 100 to 200 to 500, I am sure the thresholds, you know, you have Completely different sets of challenges at scale.

190
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,400
So could you both speak to a little bit about that?

191
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,500
You know what?

192
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:54,100
What are those thresholds and what are some of the things that need to adjust?

193
00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:01,700
So that you could still maintain that human touch, the personalization throughout the employee experience?

194
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,500
Yeah, it's a really good question.

195
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,800
So I joined my event.

196
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,000
When we had 200 employees, and now we are just over 600.

197
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:23,400
I think, when I had first joined, the operations team was immensely responsive in a very personal way to new hires and there's such a beauty in that.

198
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,700
But in a lot of ways, I don't think it was creating a consistent experience.

199
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,800
And in other ways, I don't think the team that I had was focusing on.

200
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,100
Right type of work.

201
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,700
It was more manual work.

202
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:46,200
So this is when we actually brought in Surah to help us automate a lot of those tasks and it's a fine line in a lot of ways you don't want to automate it.

203
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:53,900
So that it feels like a machine and you lose the personal touch but in a lot of ways and I think sore is done an amazing job of this.

204
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:02,500
It's actually helped us make the onboarding process very consistent and it's allowed us not to have anything fall through the cracks.

205
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:14,300
We had this issue, where we would have all staff meetings, you on a quarterly basis and the new hires, were not included in that, and we would find out after the fact and that's the hugeness on our part.

206
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:28,500
So that allowed our team to focus more on the curation of the benefits or the day one, orientation or really taking more of the bespoke approach, but just in a different way.

207
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,200
So it's focusing on the right work and not so much the manual work.

208
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,000
Totally.

209
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:48,700
Yeah, I think a lot of what we see as companies meet hit these sort of inflection points of whatever they were doing, is clearly no longer working, sometimes it's compliance-related.

210
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,300
Like, when you're 10 people, you're not really thinking about this large-scale compliance.

211
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,800
When you're a thousand people, you better not drop a single person's.

212
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:03,400
I mean, I usually handle drop it a single person's I9 but there's a lot more consequences as you.

213
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,000
Larger.

214
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,800
There are a lot I guess.

215
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,100
Yeah.

216
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,900
To sum it up Craig, put it.

217
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:18,500
Well, it's just easy to let more and more things fall through the cracks, as you have more people going through because it's just too much to remember.

218
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:28,300
But also, as you have more things that need to happen in onboarding, you need to schedule a bunch of meat and grades, you need to skip, add them to calendar invites.

219
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,800
You need to add them to all the relevant tools.

220
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,100
You there's just like more that needs to happen.

221
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:42,100
The more complex, your organization becomes and usually that's living in some kind of spreadsheet or in a combination of a few people's heads.

222
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,900
And there's just human error likely to be introduced.

223
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,700
Also, to Craig's point, The.

224
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:03,600
Work required to do the sort of bare minimum of just meeting compliance, adding them to the right meetings and getting them set up.

225
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Means that a lot of the more human pieces are dropped by default because there's just not enough time in the day to have your ideal onboarding process.

226
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,500
So you might have 15 ideas for things, you want to do.

227
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:24,000
But you're never going to get to them because the list of tasks that you must do is only growing.

228
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,200
And the number of people you must do them for is only growing.

229
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,000
I mean that's brings up a question for me about.

230
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:53,100
Just how do you balance the robotic what could feel like robotic tasks with the human touch Craig you talk a lot about earlier how really getting people into relationship and the one-on-ones is so critical the 60 plus meet and greets, right?

231
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,800
I mean how do you balance that?

232
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
How do you hold?

233
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Hold your manager.

234
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:26,400
And also even your team members accountable to making sure that balance is maintained Well, so what's interesting is, we're now getting to this place where the Departments are starting to build their own onboarding process, and we have found, you know, recently that their onboarding process I think was very separate from what we were doing and very misaligned.

235
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:34,200
And so often new hires were being thrown a lot of information in the beginning that they just can't retain.

236
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:42,000
So, Really it's allowed us to just take a step back and actually focus more on the curation and really think through.

237
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,600
OK, what do they need to know on day?

238
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:55,400
One day, two weeks, one month one, and then we are starting to also reach out to those departments with larger groups that are having their own onboarding and really figure out.

239
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,700
Where is this handshake?

240
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,800
That's supposed to happen.

241
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:04,400
So it doesn't feel like we're doing something that's in conflict with what they're doing to do that type of work though.

242
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:20,000
The only way you could, Focus on it is if you automate all these other things that as Laura put, it just consumes your day unless you forgot smarter ways to handle it and you can make even the automated stuff you can make it.

243
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:31,300
There is an upfront cost of like planning, all of that out, making it thoughtful and just kind of mat, you know, it's a simple as like, imagine you're going through onboarding.

244
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,000
What communication would you want to know?

245
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,200
What questions would you want answered to our points earlier?

246
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,600
How should I craft this email?

247
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:46,600
How would I craft this email, if they were employee number 15 with a few logistical changes?

248
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:52,800
That's how you should be speaking to employ number 500 and in sore, at least.

249
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,300
But there are other tools that do this as well, you can send an email that's actually coming from a human email address.

250
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:05,200
And when the new hire replies, you that person gets it in their inbox as if they really had sent.

251
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,100
That email.

252
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,400
So it is actually the human email it's just happening for you.

253
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:26,100
So an automated human email as much as that sounds like an oxymoron and when you are Bringing other stakeholders and I think that was the other part of the question.

254
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,300
How can you actually engage managers?

255
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:41,100
Make it very easy for them and make it fun for them and show them the impact of what a great looks like.

256
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,100
So, sometimes we have seen customer show, like, this is what good onboarding means for your report.

257
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,000
This is what bad onboarding means for your report, and it's really motivating for managers.

258
00:30:52,400 --> 00:31:14,400
If you just like, give them a list of 20 things to do, they're never going to look at this email, but if you're leasing it out a little bit and it's like this is the first thing to do the second thing to do, we actually did for you, we're going to send this email from you, you don't need to do anything about it, but if you get a reply FYI, you know, these are some things you can say.

259
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:26,200
So just like make it easy and fun and a little more digestible and again, requires that sort of upfront, planning and thoughtfulness, but pays a lot of dividends in the end.

260
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,900
That makes sense.

261
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:36,800
You know, I see a question here from Elise in our Q&A Tab and it's kind of goes along with what we were just talking about.

262
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,500
What do your 30-60-90 day touchpoints?

263
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:56,900
Look like, We have a, yeah, we have a template that we candidly, we need to improve upon this as I am sure many, many companies do.

264
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,800
But right now, what we do is we have a template for managers.

265
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:13,000
We have Surah tasks that have them schedule at 30, 60, and 90 days meetings that are outside of their typical one-on-ones, and we have our HR team reach out.

266
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,100
We Survey at 30 60 and 90 days.

267
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,300
What do they look like?

268
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,600
They're ideally as goal focused as possible.

269
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,300
This is what we said.

270
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,900
We wanted to have both on my end as a manager and on your end as an employee.

271
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,700
How did we do?

272
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,200
Was there anything that you learned in the past 30 day?

273
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,100
Let us say you're at 60 days.

274
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,600
Was there anything that you learned in the past 30 days?

275
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,600
That would have been really helpful to know in your first week?

276
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:51,300
That will help inform future onboarding iterations, just a few thoughtful look back and look forward questions.

277
00:32:51,300 --> 00:33:07,500
They don't have to be, you know, 90-minute conversations by any means, but they should be genuine and thoughtful and actually trying to pull out information that you will use in future iterations, or with that employee to improve their experience.

278
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,000
Rather than, like, did you have a good time?

279
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,700
Like, that's not really actionable.

280
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,000
On anyone's end.

281
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:30,000
Yeah, and we think about the first 30 days is sort of the hygienic period of how do we make sure that they're enrolled in benefits and the I9 they have gone through sexual harassment training.

282
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:40,100
We're also in a highly regulatory type environment, so there's many compliance things and Sops that they have to read.

283
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,500
I wish we could do a better job of tearing those out.

284
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,600
But for various reasons, it's hard.

285
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,700
But we So, and Laura spoke about this.

286
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:56,300
We also try to introduce some of the fun things so you get to order your swag in the first week.

287
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:09,400
We also when we were all working from home during covid, we would have them record a welcome video, which we would show at an all staff meeting so that's yeah that's more or less the first 30 days.

288
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:16,199
The first 60 days, we start to get them into more of the Performance Management type stuff.

289
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:23,300
We Use a tool as I mentioned called lattice and it's been a game changer for us in that.

290
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:33,500
The user experience is very strong, but it also has this functionality called one-on-ones which really allows a manager and employee to throughout the week.

291
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,500
Put on, you know, this one on one tool.

292
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:46,500
What they want to talk about when they actually discuss and it allows the manager to have a little bit of a preview of what's on the new hires mind and vice versa.

293
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:54,100
And if they don't get to a top, Like it just carries over to the next week so it really allows them to get in sync and very, very quickly.

294
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,700
We also introduced them to a recognition program and making sure that they know they can recognize employees.

295
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,100
And then when we get to the 90-day Mark, that's more of the check-in for us.

296
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,400
How are you doing?

297
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,800
How are things going?

298
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,600
We haven't got to this stage, or we have some work to do on that.

299
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,100
We're not as proactive as I wish, we were just because we're all busy, but that's where we're headed in the future.

300
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:21,900
I love that.

301
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:33,200
So just to recap that you said the first 30 days is like the check the boxes hygiene and then the next that 60-day Mark, you're thinking about Performance Management.

302
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,100
And then at the 90-day Mark, it's more of a check-in.

303
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,400
Exactly right.

304
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:52,400
That's great, love that and I love the idea on the welcome video that a new hire can do or just order swag within the first few weeks of their onboarding.

305
00:35:52,500 --> 00:36:08,600
Are there any other ideas like that you all are seeing for yourselves or your customers where they are figuring out these little things that just boost engagement, you know, by 50 points when you do these things?

306
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,100
Yeah.

307
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:19,100
Waited to the excitement goal that we talked about the excitement part of Engagement sending swag as early as possible.

308
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:24,300
Sending plants, if you're distributed sending, like some kind of thing that will help them set up.

309
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:29,400
Their workspace, send emails from leaders.

310
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,400
Make sure you have people.

311
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,700
They have already met reach out to them and congratulate them on their offer.

312
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,100
A few best practices there, one.

313
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,400
Really big thing that a previous company I worked at did that?

314
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:51,800
I feel like most companies Miss. is that there are so many logistical things that need to happen to Craig's point.

315
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,100
And his industry, there are even more logistical things than average.

316
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:02,100
The very first session on the very first day doesn't have to be sexual harassment training though.

317
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,400
It can be a really exciting demo of your product.

318
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,500
It can be the cultural session with the CEO.

319
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:20,000
The very first thing should be like, Exciting and calming the new hire a little bit like, okay, I made the right decision really in some ways.

320
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,800
I think of the first two to four weeks of onboarding as your entire job is like give the new hire confirmation that they made the right decision.

321
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,100
Keep them at that Peak excitement, as long as possible before it just like naturally Wayne's a little bit.

322
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:51,000
So as much as you can squeeze into Craig's Point, some of the fun things, ideally first thing on the first day, but also another Fun lunch on the first day, some other meet and greets in their first week, whatever.

323
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,700
You can think of That's Unique to your culture.

324
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,400
And Company is really important to Splash in right at the beginning.

325
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,600
Such a good point.

326
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:38,700
We also, we had this thing called the social six and so every month we would randomly put six employees together and Nate someone to facilitate out of the six and it was just a 30-minute get together you know meet some new people No Agenda so things like that II know it well and you know for some I think it's like I need to start contributing but I think there's so much value and really understanding who your other colleagues are is a broader human being.

327
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,400
We also have you know many companies have slack.

328
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:53,600
We have Microsoft These, and we have things to it, like cooking channels pet channels and it's just a way I think to understand, you know, again, someone outside of the work.

329
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,800
One thing.

330
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:06,900
We're still trying to figure out when we were smaller, our CEO would actually have a monthly luncheon with all the new hires and it was asked me anything, you know, there's nothing off limits.

331
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,900
We can't do that now given our size.

332
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,300
So we're trying to push some of that to the functional executive team.

333
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,900
Ember as opposed to it always needs to be the CEO.

334
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:33,300
That is tricky that scaling the meet and greet with the executives and with the CEO you know like you mentioned it's easier to do when you're 50 or maybe even 100 but how you know how do you bring in the CEO?

335
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:42,800
Touchpoint aside from your all-hands meetings and other corporate Gatherings are there other ways to bring your executive leadership in more clothes.

336
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,900
The six group or how do you do that scale?

337
00:39:52,800 --> 00:40:06,400
I think the format needs to change but the CEO should ideally still talk to new hires so it can't necessarily be ama if it's 50, people 21c CEO.

338
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,000
That's a lot of new hires to be enough.

339
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Everyone is going to get their questions answered but there could be a format kind of similar to this, where you get some questions ahead of time.

340
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,400
Maybe the CEO goes through those but also just goes through as sort of normal Spiel of culture, and whatever else.

341
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,700
Want to engage with new hires on.

342
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:41,500
So it's I think it's a format thing but it shouldn't be cut which is a mistake that we see a lot of companies do is like once something becomes unscalable, they cut it rather than just changing it.

343
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,000
Such that it's scalable from now.

344
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:54,900
And that's when you advised not to cut the CEO, touch point is really critical, I think so and to Craig's point it can also Oh, be a functional executive.

345
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,700
The CEO has a different format but the you're on the marketing team and your marketing executive does, your am a.

346
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,000
So you still are getting some of these pieces is just slightly different.

347
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And at my events size, the marketing and AMA is actually probably more relevant to this marketing new higher than a super generalized.

348
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,300
Am a so can still add a lot of value makes sense.

349
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:25,300
So I will go ahead, Craig, Oh no, the was just going to piggyback on what Laura said.

350
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:39,000
We're also trying to get away from sometimes these events you know where you're invited to meet the CEO, which in some ways I think puts pressure on some that they need to show up a certain way.

351
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:47,300
And so, one thing our CEOs really good about is he just wants to join everyday meetings and understand what's going on.

352
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:54,500
And I what I really like about that, is it, just breaks down the layers, the highwomen, Our keys and really speaks to.

353
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,900
We're all working to the same goals, and we're all, you know, side-by-side working on these things.

354
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:06,700
And that's where I really think you develop the relationships as opposed to this like Q&A format all the time.

355
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,100
There's a place for that but also just integrated into the everyday work.

356
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
I might need to copy your CEO.

357
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:35,000
Also, related to something you said earlier and made me think about when you said, removing some of that pressure, the six, the social six things that you go nominating, a facilitator I wanted to underline because otherwise when it's just six people in a zoom it's so hard to know.

358
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,600
I often find myself like wanting to carry the conversation forward, not really having prompts.

359
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,600
We actually have a blog post about that to like questions.

360
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:52,000
You can prompt in a welcome lunch because sometimes there's just this like painful Zoom silence that's really hard to get through.

361
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,300
And yeah I think the facilitation idea is super smart.

362
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,600
I agree with that.

363
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,900
S Plus 1.

364
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:11,900
So we were touching it a little bit earlier about some of the challenges and you know, I would love to hear what are some I like the do.

365
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:20,200
Not dues in onboarding like clearly don't miss the CEO meet-and-greet, don't miss these things.

366
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:29,200
What are some of the things you're seeing maybe across companies that you work with, even what you learned for yourselves, where you're like, okay, we really learned a good lesson.

367
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,500
We got to make sure that we don't do this.

368
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:40,700
The first one that comes to mind is schedule every minute of people's days for the first day or first week.

369
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,900
It's so common and it's not helpful, it's extremely overwhelming, their super tired.

370
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,400
And they have, I think, people think like, they will have nothing to do but there's plenty to do.

371
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,500
They are trying to absorb as much as possible.

372
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,100
There are things to read if you don't feel comfortable.

373
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,200
We actually give we send people an email on their second day.

374
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:10,800
Like, You know, you have plenty to do, do not feel pressure to do these things, but if you find yourself, wanting extra things to read, here's an HR blog post.

375
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,800
Here's a newsletter.

376
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:25,400
You can follow here are some like interesting pieces in our with interesting reads in our Wiki related, to culture related to your team Etc that you can look at.

377
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,300
But yeah, scheduling every minute of every day is a big No-No in my book.

378
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:33,600
Thank you.

379
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,000
That was going to be mine.

380
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,200
I am trying to think of a couple others.

381
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,200
Well, I had mentioned the new hire, buddy program.

382
00:44:42,200 --> 00:45:00,900
This is something that's good on our radar for some time and I think for me to answer your question, sometimes I think if that individual is not committed it just creates a lot of damage and leaves a really bad taste in their mouth.

383
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,400
And so we're really Trying to figure out how to craft that program in a better way.

384
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:17,800
So for example we had this rule where you can only be a new hire buddy if you had been with the organization more than a year, I actually think a new hire buddy that's recently gone through.

385
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:23,800
The onboarding is actually in a better position for some of the things that the new hires may be asking about.

386
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:40,100
So kind of pressure testing some of these like maybe historic ideas we have the other thing too is often I think we always hate when we find out later that someone was struggling, and we just didn't know.

387
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,700
And so how to make new hires really comfortable.

388
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:53,800
In maybe, raising a little bit of a flag at a certain point that hey, something doesn't feel quite right when we can catch it earlier.

389
00:45:53,900 --> 00:46:00,600
I know nine times out of 10, we could fix it, it's just when it percolates a little bit.

390
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,400
That's when we run into some problems.

391
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:08,500
So how do you encourage and get the feedback from a new hire?

392
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,700
So you can get it a little bit more real time.

393
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:19,400
So one of the things, so I come from the survey world, so I am like Pro surveys and so many ways.

394
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,600
But often I think it's just a matter of picking up the phone and saying like, hey how's it going often?

395
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:35,400
I think you just piggy or you, you jump so many of the process type things and you just cut right to the bone of what you need to get to.

396
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:42,300
It's just a matter of like making sure you do those things, and we'd certainly been guilty that some of those things.

397
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:50,800
Oh by the wayside with everything else we're doing, so we're still trying to figure out smarter ways where we can have some of those organic touch points.

398
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,200
That's not done, quote unquote through like a system.

399
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:04,700
I think this is maybe the theme of this chat is that it requires a combination of the automated and the human and it's too easy to forget.

400
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,700
One of those pieces with communication people.

401
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,600
Often forget that, you can automate that, with surveys people.

402
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,300
Often forget that.

403
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:21,600
You should also ask in inhuman ways and having the qualitative and quantitative data is the only way to get an actual picture.

404
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:23,800
That's good.

405
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,900
Well, that leads to my next question here.

406
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:33,100
When it comes to technology and platforms, what are some recommendations?

407
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:54,400
We spoke about a few earlier, but what could make the onboarding more efficient and personalized overall So I am a huge fan of Sora, like, I could not recommend sore enough and I perhaps a little biased, but it's just, it's really bent.

408
00:47:54,900 --> 00:48:01,300
It's been a complete Game Changer and I can't imagine going back to a world where we don't have Surah.

409
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:08,900
I mentioned Paulino for Ona org network analysis, lattice is also an incredible tool for us.

410
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,700
One tool that we Were made aware of that, we're learning a little bit more about is called amplifier.

411
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:29,600
And essentially, what their solution is, it's sort of like Zoom, but at certain stages in the webinar, you can actually choose who you want to have a breakout with and behind the scenes when everyone's doing that.

412
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:35,400
It then when you do the breakout sessions, it will match people up according to their designations.

413
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:42,400
So that's also a really great way as Laura talked about marrying the technology with the Human Side of Things.

414
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:51,300
And then, I think the other piece that we're exploring is welcome and how to do those, synchronous pieces, better.

415
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:59,600
And Gina, you will probably have a much better sort of overview of that, then we, yeah, thanks for bringing it up.

416
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,700
I mean, with welcome.

417
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:07,500
What's cool is where intentionally focused on the employee experience and overall life cycle.

418
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:13,500
So part of our mission is to be able to empower belonging through our platform.

419
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,800
And create those human touch points.

420
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,900
So, if we have got platforms, like, Sora and some of the other ones that are handling, the automated tasks.

421
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,900
We're trying to create what you could call almost like your hybrid virtual Auditorium.

422
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:39,500
That enables your team members, whether it's a group of six, they're jumping in to do a little quick photo booth snapshot together with a facilitator that's leading that or it's an all hands Gathering.

423
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,300
We're thinking about all of those touch points and Gatherings across the life cycle.

424
00:49:43,300 --> 00:50:02,100
So I do see how each of these Technologies even with the lattice and others, they all complement one another, but to the point of I think in the theme that we're all talking about, we still need that intentionality from leadership and from the planning and management side to make sure all these tools orchestrate.

425
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,500
Well together.

426
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:12,700
And I think this last question in the Q&A is like the perfect combination of how all this is impacting employees as well.

427
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,900
I just jump into it.

428
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:15,700
Should I use?

429
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:20,600
So the question is, how does the onboarding experience affect the rest of the employee Journey?

430
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:31,900
There are so many studies on the importance of onboarding and employee retention Employee Engagement, basically off of the most important metrics and metrics that not just people team care about.

431
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:39,000
But CEOs CFOs care about if you're not retaining employees, then you are not going to be a company.

432
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,200
At some point, if you're not ramping employees, then you're not going to hit your sales goals.

433
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,900
You're not To hit your hiring goals.

434
00:50:44,900 --> 00:51:02,900
So, all of these things really are kind of foundational to the entire business and I think two more directly answer the question affect the rest of the employee Journey, some of the themes.

435
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:13,300
So we talked about, you know, excitement introduction, integration ramp, if you break down a lot of the Tactical things you want to do for each of those goals.

436
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:20,600
Connect employees to their goals, to their colleagues, to the mission and vision, vision and culture of your company.

437
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,200
Prepare them from a logistical perspective.

438
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:40,900
From a skills perspective from just expectations in general connection and preparedness all lead to retention productivity and engagement.

439
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:46,000
Which again are basically like the most important things, I think people team care about at this point.

440
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,200
So, might sound like a cop-out answer.

441
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:56,100
But I think the answer to the question is like onboarding effects literally everything and setting them up.

442
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,600
Success is one of the most important things you can do.

443
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:10,800
One of the things we're also trying to push the frontier a little bit on is, so we have been talking about, you know, how we automate our own processes.

444
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:17,700
But we're also working on sort of this starter pack for new hires on how they can automate their own life.

445
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:23,500
So that they could spend the quality time on whether it's work or their family.

446
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,200
That's good.

447
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:32,800
So we're trying to compile a list of things like, you know, when they sign up for benefits, are you Are of these at home delivery services.

448
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,100
That may save you a trip to the pharmacy.

449
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:44,500
I know some companies, actually have, you know, things like booster fuels, that you know, Circle the parking lots, and we will fill up your gas tank.

450
00:52:45,900 --> 00:53:10,300
Some of our employees, also, our little bit, like they just don't know, they can order a second screen and making sure that they know that and the efficiency with some of having those tools and resources, we're starting to see that, you know, in the best case, we're saving some new hires five hours per week and that really adds up when, you know, start to project that out through the year.

451
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:21,800
So as part of the new hire packet, like how can they get smarter about what they're doing, not to focus more on work but just to save them time and do the things that they want to do and more of the quality way.

452
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:36,100
I love that, I think with remote distribu teams boundaries between work and life is really Challenging and as we all know, and burnout is probably at its all-time high.

453
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:42,400
So, to even as an employer to care about that, take the powers that be.

454
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,600
Yeah.

455
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:52,500
And to be able to have processes advice, you know, even strategy offered and how you can manage your personal work life balance.

456
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,900
I think there's something really powerful.

457
00:53:55,100 --> 00:54:00,200
That's communicated to a new hire that of how much this company really cares.

458
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,100
So yeah.

459
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:07,000
So that's a powerful to be able to I think bring that into the first few weeks as well.

460
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,000
That's great.

461
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:09,600
All right.

462
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,700
Well we have got about five minutes or so until we wrap up.

463
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:19,800
Does, if anyone has any questions, feel free to drop them in the Q&A tab chat.

464
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,800
Otherwise, are there any final points of advice?

465
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:33,700
Laura Craig, that you would offer out to each of us here managing leading distributed teams?

466
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:41,800
We have shared some amazing insights and very tactical applicable things we can run and do today.

467
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,100
But is there anything else that you would advise to us?

468
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:58,800
The thing that comes to mind for me, the thing, I am actually working on this at Surah internally is expectation setting.

469
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:10,500
Both again, toward that sort of preparedness theme expectation setting on, like, here's what to expect in your first week, excuse me.

470
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:48,500
But also here is what it means to succeed in your first 30 days, here is what we expect of you, when you're fully ramped, I think The more clear you can be, the more motivated people are ambiguity is very scary and there's a lot of it when you're a new hire, the more you can take that away, the more anxiety goes away and the more your you are genuinely setting them up to hit the goals that you want them to hit.

471
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,500
Because you're telling them very clearly what they are.

472
00:55:52,200 --> 00:56:01,600
So I think I was going to say if you take one thing away, but if you would take two things away from this session, it's like create the human moments.

473
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,300
And if you need to automate things to do that, then do that.

474
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,700
And the second thing would be set, the expectations and be really, really clear.

475
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:10,700
That's great.

476
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,300
Thank you.

477
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:16,800
Gosh, I always icicle first floor because you just started.

478
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,800
So what's really interesting?

479
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:31,600
I think about, you know, we're most of these individuals on the collar and the HR space and in a lot of ways, I think with the world changing, so drastically over the last two years.

480
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:54,700
I sometimes think the field has not been keeping up with really putting employees at the center and I know a lot of Police say that we have certainly been guilty that when you try to design these processes with the employee at the center, it quickly gets to be about the process as opposed to the employee.

481
00:56:55,100 --> 00:57:02,300
So always coming back to that and in a lot of ways, I think we need to kind of be a little bit more experimental.

482
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,700
We need to push the frontier a little bit more.

483
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:11,800
I don't know how many folks on the call are familiar with dowels or decentralized, autonomous organizations.

484
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:18,000
Essentially they're leaderless organizations and there's a lot of really neat stuff.

485
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:33,200
I think some of those groups are pushing but I would go back to what Laura said, around expectation, setting and just intentionality, sometimes even like, on the retention side, I think it's unrealistic.

486
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:42,400
Just to say, we want to retain employees forever and instead, maybe we want this employee to come here and have a great experience for one and two years based on there.

487
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:48,400
All's and really give them a great experience, and not always get stuck in this.

488
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,200
Like, they just need to be here forever.

489
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:56,000
Wow, powerful insights and advice.

490
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,700
I am like simmering in all the goods right now.

491
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,100
Thank you so much.

492
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,800
Laura Craig, this was very insightful helpful.

493
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:11,800
I hope that everyone in the audience today was able to take something away that you can apply to your own companies.

494
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,200
Your own circumstance.

495
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,600
Laura Craig.

496
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:16,800
Thank you.

497
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:23,900
We have a post email that will also include I believe links to A and the recording.

498
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,600
So if any of you wanted to rewind back to the insights, feel free to jump back.

499
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:33,200
Alright, so with that, we're going to wrap up our time here.

500
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:38,100

504
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:12,000
So a lot of what we were just touching right now on our panel, and we're going to focus a lot on that.

505
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,500
Human touch in the remote distributed Workforce.

506
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:23,500
Okay well with that have a wonderful rest of your day Aloha and I look forward to Seeing you at our next event.

507
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,000
Bye-bye.

1
00:16:46,502 --> 00:16:48,102
Hello everyone.

2
00:16:48,102 --> 00:16:53,702
It's so great to see you all happy August First Tuesday of the month.

3
00:16:53,702 --> 00:17:07,602
I am Gina head of marketing of welcome, and we are happy to be with you today to talk about a very, very important topic on getting effective and communicating feedback before.

4
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:10,402
We jump into our panel topic discussion.

5
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:15,102
We have got folks tuning in from Helena Montana, that's where Claire's at Janet.

6
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:16,102
Hello from Mendocino.

7
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,102
Now to Pennsylvania Dallas, Texas.

8
00:17:19,102 --> 00:17:20,002
San Diego.

9
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:22,402
It's so great to have you all here.

10
00:17:22,402 --> 00:17:23,902
I am doing it from Las Vegas.

11
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:25,702
All right.

12
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:31,802
So today we have got some, some questions that were submitted in advance.

13
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:40,702
So, feel free to go to the Q&A tab to the right and check out the questions that were submitted, feel free to upvote them.

14
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:45,302
And at any given time through this event, drop your questions.

15
00:17:45,302 --> 00:17:53,502
If you have any Cuz we're going to pull those on stage and Claire and I are going to have this Rich dialogue around the feedback, and we can answer them real time now.

16
00:17:53,502 --> 00:18:02,302
Employ feedback surfaces issues in the workplace which we all know can improve morale retention and feelings of safety.

17
00:18:02,802 --> 00:18:10,302
But the problem is there're barriers to giving feedback like fear of retaliation or fear of not being believed.

18
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:16,002
So in order to create a thriving, engaging work culture, it's critical.

19
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:18,402
To hear from your employees about what's going.

20
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:19,902
Well, what's not?

21
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:24,102
And then here's the kicker, take the action to fix it.

22
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:25,902
So I am so excited.

23
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:29,502
It's one of my favorite topics because I need to learn a lot from it as well.

24
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:32,902
But I am so excited for this opportunity to chat with Claire.

25
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:39,102
She's the founder and CEO of all voices and employee feedback management platform.

26
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:56,602
We're going to hear a little bit more about that when she comes on stage and you know, on March 20 21 all voices survey Paid 800 plus individuals from the US who are fully employed and ask them about the free feedback programs at their workplace and check this out.

27
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:02,902
79 percent of employees have shared feedback with their employer.

28
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:10,102
41% have left a job because they didn't feel listened to 37 percent.

29
00:19:10,102 --> 00:19:12,102
Have left the job because they felt feedback.

30
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:13,202
Was it being taken?

31
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:22,502
Seriously, in the workplace and said, Four percent would be more inclined to share feedback if it's truly Anonymous.

32
00:19:23,002 --> 00:19:30,502
So those are some real staggering statistics there, and I am looking forward to unpacking that a little bit more.

33
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,402
Thanks, Katie.

34
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:33,502
She's the producer right now in The Green Room.

35
00:19:33,502 --> 00:19:34,202
Hello?

36
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:35,902
Y'all feel free to say hi to her.

37
00:19:35,902 --> 00:19:40,702
Thanks for dropping that guide that all voices just put out.

38
00:19:40,902 --> 00:19:42,502
So we're going to kick off with this pole.

39
00:19:42,502 --> 00:19:44,002
We have got two poles.

40
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:48,502
The first question at your company.

41
00:19:49,102 --> 00:19:51,002
How comfortable do you think?

42
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:52,902
Employees are giving leadership.

43
00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:54,702
Positive feedback.

44
00:19:55,302 --> 00:19:57,502
Feel free to drop your votes right now.

45
00:19:58,902 --> 00:20:01,002
And then we're going to ask the flip side of it.

46
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,802
Very comfortable.

47
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,602
Oh, that's good to see somewhat comfortable.

48
00:20:06,902 --> 00:20:09,102
We got a fairly uncomfortable, extremely uncomfortable.

49
00:20:09,102 --> 00:20:13,702
Okay, we have got make sense, very uncomfortable.

50
00:20:13,702 --> 00:20:17,002
All right, next question at your company.

51
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:19,602
How comfortable do you think?

52
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:23,302
Employees are giving leadership negative feedback?

53
00:20:24,302 --> 00:20:25,602
Go ahead and drop your votes.

54
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:31,502
All right.

55
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:35,402
Okay, I am not fully seeing the votes.

56
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,002
There they are.

57
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,202
They're coming through.

58
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:46,402
All right, somewhat comfortable, 35% fairly uncomfortable, 35% and then 25%, extremely uncomfortable.

59
00:20:46,602 --> 00:20:47,102
All right.

60
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:52,502
So this probably isn't surprising to Claire.

61
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,802
I would love for you to join me on the stage.

62
00:20:57,702 --> 00:20:58,902
Hello.

63
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,502
Hello, it's great to be here.

64
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:04,602
Thanks for having me.

65
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,202
Absolutely.

66
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:16,102
Yeah it's great to see you, and I am so excited to have this conversation with you around feedback and really tap into your expertise.

67
00:21:16,602 --> 00:21:21,902
Can you tell us a little bit about all voices and even if you have any thoughts on that pole?

68
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:24,402
Yeah that pole was really interesting.

69
00:21:24,602 --> 00:21:30,302
I will share my thoughts in a second but first all voices, like Gina men.

70
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:34,202
And is an employee feedback management platform.

71
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:39,502
And what that really means is that we help employees speak up about anything.

72
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:46,502
They want to at work positive negative neutral in real time, and we have built a two-way Communication channel.

73
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:50,702
So that HR leaders legal leaders, CEOs.

74
00:21:50,702 --> 00:22:06,302
Anyone in the leadership role is able to have a back and forth conversation with that employee, and then we provide a bunch of tools on the back end for the Teachers to help them take action, understand, patterns, and Trends, and ultimately resolve.

75
00:22:06,302 --> 00:22:08,702
The things that are being brought up in one way or another.

76
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,502
So it's been a really fascinating Journey.

77
00:22:12,502 --> 00:22:18,702
We have been doing it for five years and I think just to touch back on those poll results.

78
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:52,502
One thing that's really interesting to me when I started all voices, it was really in response to the me to movement, that was emerging and my hypothesis was that Would be extremely hesitant to speak up at work, about really serious issues, like sexual harassment, discrimination mistreatment, and what we found in the first, like, six months was that employees were using our platform to share all kinds of feedback positive negative anywhere in between a lot of questions, actually.

79
00:22:52,902 --> 00:23:00,302
So what we realized was for one reason or another many employees have hesitations about speaking up about anything.

80
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:21,902
I am at work and so making sure that you have some way for them to speak up anonymously, which goes back to that statistic, Gina that you shared about employees, wanting and preferring to have an option at least for anonymous feedback, that was really one of the things that I took away from the first six months is, like, no matter what's going on with an employee.

81
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:26,002
It's good for them to have multiple different channels to share that feedback.

82
00:23:26,302 --> 00:23:30,302
Hmm, ii-i'd love to tap into that more.

83
00:23:30,802 --> 00:23:34,502
I know we have some other questions going to, but like what are all those channels?

84
00:23:34,502 --> 00:23:37,602
Like if we can get into that later on, that would be great.

85
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:39,702
What I would like to kick it off?

86
00:23:39,702 --> 00:23:42,902
First with a question that came through.

87
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:48,902
How would you define good versus bad feedback?

88
00:23:48,902 --> 00:23:53,002
And I think we can start with the ladder on bad feedback.

89
00:23:53,202 --> 00:24:02,302
I know Claire when you are you and I were chatting earlier, there's probably a lot more bad behavior that occurs around this in a workplace.

90
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:03,202
What are your thoughts?

91
00:24:05,102 --> 00:24:12,002
Yeah, I mean I think look having a company is just challenging, right?

92
00:24:12,002 --> 00:24:27,002
And I started a company and I have seen this firsthand, but you're bringing together a big group of people who all come from different backgrounds, have different experiences, have different communication Styles, you're bringing them all together, whether they're remote, or they're all in the same room.

93
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:33,702
And you're saying like, Okay, let us all work together toward the shared goal, there are always going to be conflict.

94
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:35,802
They're always going to be miscommunication.

95
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:40,302
There are always going to be challenges personality clashes Etc, right?

96
00:24:40,302 --> 00:24:56,802
There's no like perfect company culture or Utopia and so the question in my mind is how do you make it possible for employees to speak up about what's going on about what their reality is early and often?

97
00:24:56,802 --> 00:25:03,602
And if you do that, what you will find is that you have the information that you need to take.

98
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,902
Action to make things better, right?

99
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:13,402
You so in terms of like bad behavior versus good behavior, bad feedback versus good feedback.

100
00:25:13,602 --> 00:25:26,902
I would say in general, it's just about needing to first, to sort of start with listening and understanding what's going on and making sure that people actually feel safe speaking up.

101
00:25:27,802 --> 00:25:33,302
And like I said, even if let us say your company is perfect, let us say it's this dream company.

102
00:25:33,302 --> 00:25:33,602
Where everyone?

103
00:25:33,802 --> 00:25:36,602
Everyone feels 100% comfortable being transparent.

104
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:45,202
Being honest, you're still going to have issues come up and people come to your company with baggage from their previous rules.

105
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:55,202
And so even if you as an HR leader are incredibly approachable, and you have built relationships with every person, they're still probably a lot.

106
00:25:55,202 --> 00:25:57,902
That is not being brought to you for one reason or another.

107
00:25:57,902 --> 00:26:10,702
So I think of all voices, as kind of like The Back-up Plan, like In case someone's not comfortable coming to, you just have another way that they can speak up, just to make sure you have all your bases covered.

108
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,102
Mmm, that's good.

109
00:26:13,402 --> 00:26:13,902
That's good.

110
00:26:13,902 --> 00:26:41,902
So, when you know, you were mentioning something about how bad behavior has been part of companies for a long time and, you know, it's been a broken system that a lot of us are used to operating within where the proper channels aren't in place and Managers may not have the training knowing how to have a constructive conversation around feedback with their employees.

111
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:44,902
So what are your thoughts to this?

112
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:48,402
And you know what, what does that look like for?

113
00:26:48,402 --> 00:26:57,902
And I think this goes into the next highest voted question is, you know, what is the best way to provide constructive feedback to your leader to your employee?

114
00:26:57,902 --> 00:26:59,002
This goes both ways.

115
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:14,702
Yeah, so when I was doing research to into this space right into employee reporting an employee feedback and how historically employees have spoken up at work.

116
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:26,402
I looked at a really interesting report from the EEOC and what that said was that I was specifically looking at harassment at the time because we were sort of the me to movement was emerging.

117
00:27:26,402 --> 00:27:45,002
And I was thinking about solutions to people not Harassment in particular and I found some really fascinating data and what it said is that 75% of people who experience sexual harassment in the workplace, never report it, right?

118
00:27:45,002 --> 00:28:01,102
So they don't share that information with someone who could actually take action and address it out of that 25%, who do report it according to the EEOC 75% of those individuals face, some type of retaliation Ation for speaking up.

119
00:28:01,402 --> 00:28:11,702
So to me, I looked at those two stats and took them together and realize like these data points, really represent a broken system, like you said Gina.

120
00:28:11,702 --> 00:28:22,002
So I think historically like preemie to movement pre 2017, we as a society, basically, just that Okay.

121
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:25,302
Employees like speak of or nobody will help you.

122
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:29,402
And those are kind of your two options and employees for the most part.

123
00:28:29,402 --> 00:28:35,202
According to that data, just stayed quiet and maybe they became disengaged unproductive.

124
00:28:35,302 --> 00:28:36,902
Maybe they quit their jobs.

125
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:49,502
You know, even during the Great resignation, I think there was a stab at 57% of people who left their jobs during the Great resignation of 2021 left because they felt disrespected at work.

126
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:59,602
So these are solvable Issues, right, but someone at the company needs to know what's going on in order to take action to try to help resolve it.

127
00:29:00,602 --> 00:29:12,502
So I think just to go back to the beginning, like we have had a broken system for a really long time and for so long it was just like, okay, deal with it.

128
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:21,402
And I think what happened in during the me to movement is that the public took great interest in how employees were being treated and started to make it okay?

129
00:29:21,502 --> 00:29:38,602
For employees to share their experiences publicly and to actually hold companies accountable in the public eye for the behavior that was happening within their companies, even if leadership wasn't aware, it was sort of like, it doesn't matter.

130
00:29:38,602 --> 00:29:41,102
And the fact that you're not aware is the problem.

131
00:29:42,102 --> 00:29:51,402
So, that's kind of the evolution that I have seen since then is that there's a lot more accountability for companies and there's a lot more required of them.

132
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:55,802
And so, to this question about, how is the best way to provide constructive feedback?

133
00:29:55,902 --> 00:30:00,902
I really think companies need to create multiple options or multiple channels.

134
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:05,202
Like I said, before for employees to speak up, so have an open door policy.

135
00:30:05,202 --> 00:30:14,402
Make sure they know who on the HR team or the employer relations team for the executive team to go talk to if they're having a challenge or an experience.

136
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:19,602
Give them tips for having actually conversations with their own direct leadership.

137
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:25,502
But also, make sure there's a secondary channel for employees.

138
00:30:25,502 --> 00:30:33,002
Speak up that feels a lot safer to them where they can be anonymous, where they don't have to fear retaliation just for having spoken up.

139
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:43,202
I mean, you see companies put out those annual surveys, you know you could like Google search the questions and drop them into like a Google form and send it out.

140
00:30:43,202 --> 00:30:43,902
You know what I am saying?

141
00:30:45,002 --> 00:30:51,402
Are those effective and you know, that is that a channel as well?

142
00:30:52,002 --> 00:30:54,802
To be considered or what are your thoughts there?

143
00:30:57,102 --> 00:31:01,302
I don't think they're effective at solving the problem that we're talking about today.

144
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:09,302
I think they solve a different problem which is at a given point in time and over a period of time, right?

145
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:16,302
Year over year what is the sort of overall high-level cultural health of my organization?

146
00:31:16,602 --> 00:31:18,502
And is it trending in the right direction or not?

147
00:31:19,802 --> 00:31:25,702
That I think is what those annual culture, surveys are good for it, and I think they have a role.

148
00:31:25,702 --> 00:31:33,202
It's great to, it's great to measure that what it's not great at is, let us say you send that survey out in January every year.

149
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:36,902
And in February, I have an issue and I don't know who to talk to.

150
00:31:37,302 --> 00:31:38,802
It's an issue with my manager.

151
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:39,402
I am nervous.

152
00:31:39,402 --> 00:31:40,502
Bringing it up to my manager.

153
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:48,702
I don't feel like I have the tools, maybe I was retaliated against at a past company and so, I am especially scared or hesitant to bring something up.

154
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:52,602
And I am, Receiving a culture survey until next January.

155
00:31:52,802 --> 00:31:55,002
So am I supposed to you as the employee?

156
00:31:55,002 --> 00:32:04,502
Just stay quiet and gut it out over 11 months and then put something in a culture survey that I am not even sure will be followed up on.

157
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:06,702
I am not even sure if it's possible to be followed up on.

158
00:32:06,702 --> 00:32:11,402
I am not sure if it's Anonymous or not, I don't know the difference between Anonymous and confidential.

159
00:32:13,702 --> 00:32:25,102
There needs to be a real-time solution in place for those types of issues so that they can get resolved now and not in 11 months or, you know, possibly never.

160
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:43,302
So if you were to break out the different types of channels, you mentioned, you know, having an open door policy and being able to have that conversation, both ways and police should feel that openness and their one-on-ones with their manager and vice versa.

161
00:32:44,302 --> 00:33:10,502
And then you mentioned, you know, maybe it's quarterly or annually annual surveys to gauge patterns of Health but then there's the ongoing that you're talking about and what are some recommended channels that we could tactically use today for something that's a little bit ongoing outside of the one-on-ones that you may have with your team member or manager on a weekly basis.

162
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:11,002
Let us say.

163
00:33:12,202 --> 00:33:12,502
Yeah.

164
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:17,702
So a couple of those, a couple of solutions we have built right?

165
00:33:17,702 --> 00:33:22,102
One is all voices Anonymous feedback Channel letting employees be kept in.

166
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:27,802
Real time, anonymously sharing feedback and then communicating back and forth with that employee.

167
00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:32,702
Another one we have that we think has been really valuable to our customers is pulse surveys.

168
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:38,902
So, let us say that, you're so not a big annual culture survey with 50 questions, right?

169
00:33:39,302 --> 00:33:42,702
That needs like a data scientist to analyze all the Service for you.

170
00:33:42,702 --> 00:33:49,802
But let us say you're hearing about a specific topic, like, oh, I don't like our new PTO policy and you're hearing that through all voices.

171
00:33:49,802 --> 00:33:52,402
Maybe some managers are hearing whispers of that.

172
00:33:52,602 --> 00:33:55,302
It's starting to kind of like Ripple through the organization.

173
00:33:55,602 --> 00:34:02,602
You could send out a pulse survey that day and say hey wanted to ask some questions about our new PTO policy.

174
00:34:02,602 --> 00:34:06,302
One is this better or worse than our previous policy to?

175
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,502
What are the things you would like to see that?

176
00:34:08,502 --> 00:34:11,802
The policy includes that it doesn't include three Etc.

177
00:34:11,902 --> 00:34:12,202
Right?

178
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:16,302
And you're, you're pulling information in real time.

179
00:34:16,302 --> 00:34:25,002
And then you're pushing request for more information back out about a very specific and actionable topic, so that can be incredibly valuable to.

180
00:34:25,002 --> 00:34:32,202
And then, the third tool that I have started to hear more and more about leaders using is stay interviews.

181
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:43,402
So, I think those need to be conducted in concert with some of these other sort of measurement tactics and tools but stator Use earn opportunity.

182
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:45,002
So we all know about exit interviews, right?

183
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:50,702
Which is like when someone leaves you conduct an exit interview to find out why they left and that's helpful.

184
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:54,002
But it doesn't help you in retaining that employee, right?

185
00:34:54,002 --> 00:34:55,101
They have already left.

186
00:34:55,702 --> 00:35:03,702
So, it's a little bit too late and hopefully you use the exit interviews to prevent others from leaving, but it doesn't help with that.

187
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:04,802
The ones who have already left.

188
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:16,302
So stay interviews are sort of the inverse of that, which is leaders from within the company set up time to You just talk one-on-one with individual employees about why they're stay right?

189
00:35:16,302 --> 00:35:17,602
Why they're not leaving.

190
00:35:18,302 --> 00:35:20,802
So it's an opportunity to say like what's working?

191
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:22,802
Well, what do you like about your job?

192
00:35:22,802 --> 00:35:24,302
What do you like about the company?

193
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:27,802
Also, what's not working, how can we better support you?

194
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:31,502
How can we meet your needs better as an employee?

195
00:35:31,502 --> 00:35:34,302
How do we make sure that you're still here a year from now?

196
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:49,502
And I think the combination of all of those different practices can be incredibly valuable at painting like a Comprehensive picture of what's going on with employees at is really interesting, the state interviews.

197
00:35:49,802 --> 00:35:51,502
What's the frequency?

198
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:58,302
And do you recommend leaders that are not the direct manager of the employee?

199
00:35:59,002 --> 00:36:00,002
I do, yes.

200
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:04,202
I think, I think it's actually a great role for HR.

201
00:36:04,302 --> 00:36:11,702
I think HR business partners, and HR leaders spending time talking to employees about just how they're doing it.

202
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:12,802
In general, right?

203
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:16,302
Not around a specific incident or investigation.

204
00:36:16,302 --> 00:36:18,502
But just like, how are you doing?

205
00:36:18,502 --> 00:36:20,102
Conducting a stay interview.

206
00:36:20,402 --> 00:36:21,402
Anything that's not working.

207
00:36:21,402 --> 00:36:23,302
Well, how is your relationship with your manager?

208
00:36:23,302 --> 00:36:30,002
Like all of these things are helpful and, and to go back to my earlier point, there might be hesitation in those conversations, right?

209
00:36:30,002 --> 00:36:41,802
There might be fear from employees still, but at least you're giving them the opportunity to speak up and showing them that you and the organization are receptive to feedback and want.

210
00:36:41,902 --> 00:36:45,002
Feedback and hopefully by having additional ways for them to speak up.

211
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:56,502
Like I said, the stay interview in combination with all voices reports in combination with, you know, the poll surveys and the annual culture survey that together paints a more comprehensive picture.

212
00:36:56,802 --> 00:36:57,602
Gotcha?

213
00:36:57,702 --> 00:36:58,302
Okay.

214
00:36:58,502 --> 00:37:09,602
So one of the other thoughts I have is being able to create a culture that feels safe to conduct these ongoing pulse surveys.

215
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:20,002
And you know, you're asking its listening a lot of Information from your employees but then I think from an employee perspective, you know, my employers asking all this stuff, what are they going to do with it?

216
00:37:20,402 --> 00:37:29,902
You know, and I think there needs to be proven ways to demonstrate that their that on her door, that actions be taken.

217
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:30,902
So that goes to one of them.

218
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:33,002
There's a question that's been submitted here.

219
00:37:33,202 --> 00:37:34,502
It's got four up votes.

220
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:41,002
I have seen many organizations struggle with how to share and act on employee feedback.

221
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:46,502
How can Relations execute action around feedback better?

222
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:50,202
Hmm, I got a great question.

223
00:37:51,602 --> 00:38:05,002
So basically, I think we're starting to get to a point where companies know, they have to provide ways for employees to share feedback, but I think sometimes the missing piece is then converting that feedback into action.

224
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:14,602
So one of the things that I mentioned, right, the pulse survey, that's actually a great example of showing employees.

225
00:38:14,602 --> 00:38:19,502
So let us say, let us say four employees submitted Concerns about the PTO policy.

226
00:38:19,902 --> 00:38:24,502
And then a week later, you the HR leader are sending the entire company.

227
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:37,802
A survey about the PTO policy that's actually actioned that's showing that you are looking into something that is being brought up and trying to continuously improve, whatever it is, that was raised as a potential issue.

228
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:46,202
So the pulse survey itself is a form of action and then in response to the pulse survey, there's additional action that can be taken.

229
00:38:46,202 --> 00:38:50,302
So maybe, At an all-hands meeting you share the results of the poll survey.

230
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:55,802
You say 75 percent of people in the company feel good about our PTO policy.

231
00:38:55,802 --> 00:39:00,202
And the number one Improvement that was requested was bereavement leave.

232
00:39:00,402 --> 00:39:06,802
So we are going to add bereavement leave since that's something, we have never had and something that the majority of you wanted.

233
00:39:07,802 --> 00:39:12,002
That's all and that's not rocketed science, right?

234
00:39:12,002 --> 00:39:21,402
That's simply being responsive to the feedback that you're getting and then communicating the responsiveness, which I think is sometimes the missing piece.

235
00:39:22,302 --> 00:39:34,202
Another example of something we have heard from customers, is that communication piece is sometimes just missing like leadership knows something, but they haven't yet communicated it down to the rest of the organization.

236
00:39:34,202 --> 00:39:39,002
So one of our customers was getting a bunch of reports about Space issues.

237
00:39:39,102 --> 00:39:46,402
Like we're all, you know, the pre-pandemic but like we're all, you know, elbow-to-elbow, I can't even like breathe in my space.

238
00:39:46,402 --> 00:39:47,602
Like, what is going on?

239
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:55,002
Meanwhile, leadership had been looking for a new office space for the last like, four months so that search was underway.

240
00:39:55,002 --> 00:40:04,402
But employees had no idea because oftentimes leadership as leadership, we don't announce things until they're done or at least more solidified.

241
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,202
But sometimes it's just a matter of saying we heard you.

242
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:15,002
No, this is you know we are all crammed in here and this is untenable, we are in the search for an office space.

243
00:40:15,002 --> 00:40:18,502
We think we will have One Secured in the next three to six months.

244
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:24,102
And in the meantime, we're looking into, you know, getting some satellite office options, right?

245
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:31,502
It's not always about having a fully baked solution to roll out and announce with a perfectly executed, communication strategy.

246
00:40:31,502 --> 00:40:36,602
Sometimes it's just communicating that you're working on something and that, you know, it's an issue.

247
00:40:39,002 --> 00:41:01,102
So that yes, I think Paula just mentioned here, the positive energy you got from asking for feedback can be negated if there is a lack of action on that feedback so it is very critical and I guess one of my questions would be, who is there a point person that should be responsible to handle the surveys?

248
00:41:01,202 --> 00:41:06,502
Make sure it's properly being communicated out like what team generally is responsible.

249
00:41:07,202 --> 00:41:10,502
And if you know, like It's a I would assume HR right?

250
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:13,502
But what if you don't have an HR room?

251
00:41:14,502 --> 00:41:18,202
Yeah, I was just going to say it really depends on the size of the organization.

252
00:41:18,202 --> 00:41:21,602
So let us say you're a 10-person company, right?

253
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:30,702
We have been a 10-person company, and we didn't have HR at that time, but we still, but you still want to create opportunities for people to share feedback.

254
00:41:31,302 --> 00:41:43,802
I think it's an initiative that in the earlier days or in the smaller days needs to be led by the CEO, I think creating a healthy culture is ultimately a part of the CEOs job.

255
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:46,002
It's not just about delivering results.

256
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:55,502
It's about how do you get those results and part of that is hiring recruiting retaining key emphasis on retaining employees.

257
00:41:56,902 --> 00:42:05,702
So, you know, in the early days like I let all of our culture initiatives, I am still super involved in our culture initiatives, and we now have almost 40 employees.

258
00:42:05,702 --> 00:42:18,202
So I think it has to come from the Top down, it has to in order, especially in order for people to feel like action is actually going to be taken, right?

259
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:35,902
Because if you pass off the initiative to someone who then doesn't have the ability to take action or you're not providing a way for them to take action on the feedback received that can actually to Paul is point that can actually backfire and have a negative impact.

260
00:42:37,202 --> 00:42:38,102
That's good to know.

261
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:42,602
Okay, we have got another question with some pretty high up votes here.

262
00:42:43,402 --> 00:42:46,802
Before closing a feedback conversation.

263
00:42:47,102 --> 00:42:51,402
How do you best ensure that the feedback has been understood?

264
00:42:54,402 --> 00:43:05,702
So I think that miscommunications always happen or can happen and so it is really good to clarify the information that you're receiving.

265
00:43:06,902 --> 00:43:10,502
So I guess this answer would differ a bit depending on the context.

266
00:43:11,702 --> 00:43:18,502
So in a state interview I would actually say repeating things back to the employee.

267
00:43:18,702 --> 00:43:22,502
This is kind of what you're saying, let me make sure I understand it.

268
00:43:22,702 --> 00:43:27,402
In rephrase it back to them, and then they have the opportunity to say.

269
00:43:27,402 --> 00:43:28,502
No, not exactly.

270
00:43:28,502 --> 00:43:40,102
I am actually saying more than this so that you really both leave that conversation with complete clarity about at least what was being said, you don't have to solve the problem in the meeting, right?

271
00:43:40,202 --> 00:43:43,002
You don't have to come up with all the answers in the meeting.

272
00:43:43,202 --> 00:43:52,502
This is really an opportunity to listen and this type of listening if it's done, effectively would mean that you both walk out of that.

273
00:43:52,602 --> 00:43:57,602
Conversation with the same understanding of that person's experience and what they share.

274
00:43:59,502 --> 00:44:01,802
So how do you, you know, we have built a software platform?

275
00:44:01,802 --> 00:44:08,802
So how do you kind of like mimic that experience through a digital communication Channel?

276
00:44:08,802 --> 00:44:14,602
There's a couple things one, you can still repeat back digitally like hey this is what I am hearing.

277
00:44:14,602 --> 00:44:15,302
Does this make sense?

278
00:44:15,302 --> 00:44:19,002
You can clarify what you think as the HR leader?

279
00:44:19,002 --> 00:44:22,602
What the next steps are and how you know how that works for?

280
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:23,402
Other person.

281
00:44:24,602 --> 00:44:46,102
But then actually we have built into our product and additional data point, which is after the employee and the employer and the conversation, and that conversation gets marked by the administrator as resolved, so they can track like, how many open issues do I have versus closed?

282
00:44:46,702 --> 00:44:48,102
We actually all voices.

283
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,202
Send a follow-up survey to the employee.

284
00:44:50,402 --> 00:44:52,502
And it's just, it's still an honor.

285
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:55,502
Amos and it's just like two questions.

286
00:44:55,702 --> 00:45:07,902
How satisfied are you with the way that was handled, and we're any steps taken to address the issue that you raised and then that data goes back to the HR leader.

287
00:45:08,102 --> 00:45:16,502
So maybe the HR person thinks that something has been totally satisfactorily resolved, but the employee does not feel that way.

288
00:45:16,702 --> 00:45:21,602
Then they can reopen the conversation and say, hey, I saw that you didn't feel like this was quite handled.

289
00:45:22,702 --> 00:45:23,902
Now to resolution.

290
00:45:24,202 --> 00:45:25,302
What else do you need?

291
00:45:25,402 --> 00:45:26,702
What am I missing?

292
00:45:26,702 --> 00:45:28,202
What else can I do for you?

293
00:45:28,502 --> 00:45:33,102
Where do you think you know the gaps are or the opportunity to improve this further?

294
00:45:33,802 --> 00:45:39,702
So that's another sort of like tool that helps make sure everyone is on the same page.

295
00:45:39,902 --> 00:45:41,402
What were those two questions again?

296
00:45:41,402 --> 00:45:44,502
How satisfied are you with how it was handled?

297
00:45:44,502 --> 00:45:45,202
And what else?

298
00:45:45,802 --> 00:45:52,502
So, it's basically been you aware of the company taking steps to address the issue that you raised and how satisfied are you with the way?

299
00:45:52,602 --> 00:45:55,002
It was handled on it, that's good.

300
00:45:55,002 --> 00:46:02,802
So, that's sort of guy this question that can be asked after the one-on-one session that a manager may have with their employee.

301
00:46:03,102 --> 00:46:08,002
And then, you need that third party, though, to probably be filtering through that.

302
00:46:08,002 --> 00:46:14,102
And then providing you need that system to have that conversation and feedback.

303
00:46:14,102 --> 00:46:17,602
Go back to the manager, you know, that the invoice.

304
00:46:17,702 --> 00:46:19,502
Now, what about the other way around?

305
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:22,502
As an employee, you know, going back to those poll results.

306
00:46:23,002 --> 00:46:31,202
It is very challenging to provide negative feedback to your manager to the leadership.

307
00:46:31,402 --> 00:46:48,502
So let us say we don't have all of those channels that you have identified Claire Where did you start as an employee to have a constructive conversation with your dirt direct manager?

308
00:46:50,202 --> 00:47:02,702
Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, the way I think about this is that the best way to build trust with employees, is by listening and taking action.

309
00:47:02,702 --> 00:47:05,302
So you have to build trust over time.

310
00:47:05,302 --> 00:47:10,502
And I think in some ways all voices is kind of shortcut to building that trust Is it gives you the information?

311
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:13,002
You may not be getting and helps you show.

312
00:47:13,002 --> 00:47:23,802
Like, it's okay to bring things up, and we will actually take action even if we have no idea who you are in the absence of a tool like that, you have to do a little more heavy lifting yourself, right?

313
00:47:23,802 --> 00:47:32,102
You have to have you know, many opportunities for employees to share their feedback, directly with you as a manager.

314
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:34,302
You have to ask a lot of questions, right?

315
00:47:34,302 --> 00:47:39,002
You have to get an in-depth understanding of what that employees experience.

316
00:47:39,302 --> 00:47:45,002
Are there any like roadblocks for them are there do they feel good about their career path?

317
00:47:45,002 --> 00:47:45,402
You know?

318
00:47:45,402 --> 00:48:19,002
And these conversations are most likely happening between a manager and their employee and I think over time if you show them that when they share feedback even if it's constructive or negative feedback that they're not fired, but they're not demoted that they're not shut out of projects continuously just asking for it and showing that Want it and then having no repercussions or — you know retaliation or anything like that happen as a result that can very slowly build trust as well.

319
00:48:19,002 --> 00:48:27,302
Because they will say okay, two weeks ago, I told my manager this thing, and they actually thanked me for my feedback, nothing bad has happened.

320
00:48:27,302 --> 00:48:39,002
Since then, I think I can bring up another issue so it's about like building the trust via two-way communication to start to make employees fill.

321
00:48:39,102 --> 00:48:40,102
More comfortable.

322
00:48:40,602 --> 00:48:52,002
So let us say you're in a culture where That trust has not been built but as an employee I still need to voice certain things to my employer.

323
00:48:53,002 --> 00:48:55,802
How would I even start that conversation?

324
00:48:56,002 --> 00:49:00,002
Where it wouldn't get to like maybe subjective or emotional?

325
00:49:00,002 --> 00:49:15,102
Like you have any Frameworks of recommendation of how an employee can even approach a manager with you know, the feedback I think it's really hard when there's not trusted.

326
00:49:15,102 --> 00:49:15,702
I do.

327
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:25,802
I think, I think people are scared, you know, part of it is our jobs are not just like something we do for fun, right?

328
00:49:25,802 --> 00:49:28,002
Our jobs are how we pay our bills.

329
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:30,002
It's how we take care of our families.

330
00:49:30,002 --> 00:49:31,202
It's how we pay rent.

331
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:32,502
It's how we buy food.

332
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:41,902
And so when evaluating kind of like the cost benefit of bringing something up, that might be difficult in a context where you haven't built.

333
00:49:42,002 --> 00:49:44,502
Us with someone and you don't feel trust in them.

334
00:49:46,102 --> 00:50:02,102
It can just feel too risky and a lot of employees and up just staying quiet because they don't want to bring up something difficult with someone they don't trust in, you know, two months later, find themself fire.

335
00:50:03,902 --> 00:50:06,502
So it's about you know, as an employee.

336
00:50:06,502 --> 00:50:12,202
I don't want to give employees sort of like false confidence that no Matter.

337
00:50:12,202 --> 00:50:14,602
What if you bring things up, it will all be, okay?

338
00:50:14,602 --> 00:50:16,202
Like I don't think that's true.

339
00:50:16,602 --> 00:50:21,802
Is that where we should be heading as a society, is that the kind of culture that?

340
00:50:21,802 --> 00:50:30,902
I am sure everybody on this call wants to build at their companies, of course, but there's a gap between where we are today and where we want to be.

341
00:50:31,202 --> 00:50:34,702
And so that's why I started all voices to bridge the gap.

342
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:58,602
But over time, what I would love to see is that there's a ton of opportunity for It healthy candid conversations within companies between managers and their direct reports between employees and HR between employees and the CEO and that it's in an environment free from retaliation.

343
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:03,902
That's where we want to be, but we're just not there yet.

344
00:51:04,202 --> 00:51:14,002
Okay, I appreciate your honesty in that and, you know, we're hoping that everyone on this call here if your Eating an organization starts at the top.

345
00:51:14,902 --> 00:51:23,502
So there're opportunities to start building trust today with your employees and creating a nurturing that kind of environment.

346
00:51:24,002 --> 00:51:28,502
All right, we have got another question here that I think relates to what we were just talking about.

347
00:51:28,802 --> 00:51:39,202
How do you communicate to your CEO that their behavior and reaction to things is making people leave It's really hard?

348
00:51:41,902 --> 00:51:55,302
You know, in a situation like that, unless you have a really strong relationship with the CEO and you have built a lot of trust with them, you know, maybe you're their director Porter, you have known them for a long time.

349
00:51:57,002 --> 00:51:59,002
It's really tricky to do.

350
00:51:59,002 --> 00:52:02,002
I think some of that has to come anonymously?

351
00:52:03,102 --> 00:52:11,502
Maybe your company has a 3D 360 feedback programs where people who report to someone get to also share?

352
00:52:11,702 --> 00:52:19,902
Their feedback like as a performance review, that's like one opportunity potentially or it's through some type of anonymous Channel.

353
00:52:21,702 --> 00:52:31,002
But you know, I have tried to build like incredibly transparent culture healthy candid, like we really walk.

354
00:52:31,002 --> 00:52:33,002
The walk of what we're trying to do?

355
00:52:33,102 --> 00:52:34,902
We use our own tool internally.

356
00:52:35,202 --> 00:52:38,302
I also have like an open door policy, like put time on my calendar.

357
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:39,002
Come talk to me.

358
00:52:39,002 --> 00:52:39,502
What's working?

359
00:52:39,502 --> 00:52:40,302
What's not working?

360
00:52:40,802 --> 00:52:53,202
I still No, it is really hard for people to speak up to me even about challenges, they're having with someone else at the company, let alone challenges, they're having with me, right?

361
00:52:53,302 --> 00:52:54,302
My behavior.

362
00:52:54,302 --> 00:52:56,502
I think that's just incredibly intimidating.

363
00:52:58,702 --> 00:53:18,002
So I think CEOs need to be doing a better job of asking questions of getting to know people of building trust and Rapport of even saying like hey does everyone Here, feel comfortable sharing feedback directly with me and if not, like, what could I do to better?

364
00:53:18,002 --> 00:53:30,902
Encourage that like, even one step removed from actually setting up a system where the feedback can be, shared is asking like, is there a feeling of safety of psychological safety, right?

365
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:51,402
Because I think this question really indicates, like the structural challenge that exist today, which is that, I as the CEO or any CEO, hot have more power in the organization than, like, a junior employee or someone who might have feedback for me.

366
00:53:51,702 --> 00:54:02,002
And so, just by definition in that hierarchy, it is challenging for the person who's more Junior to give critical feedback to the person who's more senior.

367
00:54:02,002 --> 00:54:04,502
So, we have to, And workarounds to that.

368
00:54:06,102 --> 00:54:11,002
So at the very least, we have to figure out ways to provide Anonymous feedback.

369
00:54:11,302 --> 00:54:12,202
Maybe that's the way.

370
00:54:12,702 --> 00:54:21,102
Absolutely back to whoever Point person it is but figuring out just a way to get that information to them.

371
00:54:21,402 --> 00:54:24,002
And actually, there's a related question here.

372
00:54:24,502 --> 00:54:29,202
What are the words one would use to tell the owner CEO?

373
00:54:29,602 --> 00:54:34,202
Hey, you are our biggest problem, the CEO is not going anywhere.

374
00:54:34,202 --> 00:54:41,502
The owner, you know, So the choice becomes one of improvement versus losing the employee.

375
00:54:42,802 --> 00:54:43,302
Yeah.

376
00:54:43,502 --> 00:54:44,702
It's tough.

377
00:54:44,702 --> 00:54:46,002
Just like we were just talking about.

378
00:54:46,002 --> 00:55:01,402
Like, I don't recommend someone on this call, go to their CEO and say you're our biggest problem or I can't even think of a great phrasing that would make that message go over well.

379
00:55:01,902 --> 00:55:07,002
But what I can say is that the CEO does need the information in order to improve sometimes.

380
00:55:07,002 --> 00:55:11,702
It's just about self-awareness, we hopefully all like ourselves.

381
00:55:11,702 --> 00:55:18,102
And sometimes we don't see the gaps in the areas of improvement that we have.

382
00:55:18,102 --> 00:55:20,902
So, hopefully, the CEO is working on themselves.

383
00:55:20,902 --> 00:55:24,902
Hopefully, the CEO has a coach or hopefully the CEO Is.

384
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:31,102
Talking to advisors, right talking to their board?

385
00:55:31,602 --> 00:55:37,402
Getting that feedback from someone who is more of a peer and not someone who is Junior to them.

386
00:55:37,902 --> 00:56:09,002
But ultimately, at the end of the day, the people who report to the CEO or the people who report to the CEO are the ones that have the best insight into how the CEOs, you know, style personality, whatever are impacting the business's ability to succeed and that's why Needs to be some type of anonymous channel, for this, exact type of situation because I think in some cases with awareness CEOs and leaders can improve.

387
00:56:09,302 --> 00:56:13,702
So it doesn't have to be, you know, you can't speak up to the CEO.

388
00:56:13,702 --> 00:56:15,402
So you just have to leave your job.

389
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:19,902
There has to be a third option, but they have to get the information first.

390
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:24,902
And if you give them the information through an anonymous Channel, and then they still don't improve.

391
00:56:25,902 --> 00:56:30,802
Then it's a really tough situation then I would potentially start looking for a new job.

392
00:56:33,002 --> 00:56:33,802
That's unfortunate.

393
00:56:33,802 --> 00:56:34,402
It's real.

394
00:56:34,502 --> 00:56:50,302
I think it's real for a lot of people I think working remote or distributed also makes it even more challenging to be able to communicate in general and then communicate such sensitive information back to a leader.

395
00:56:50,702 --> 00:57:02,402
You know, as you were talking about power dynamics, and I am seeing Clarissa and Christina plus one that I am wondering if there's certain key leaders around?

396
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:16,302
On the CEO who and employee could feel safe to speak to and hopefully get a message relayed through you know the powers that be in the leadership team to the CEO.

397
00:57:16,302 --> 00:57:18,202
What are your thoughts about that?

398
00:57:18,202 --> 00:57:24,202
And, you know, I am really curious to hear a little bit more about the power Dynamic aspect as well around feedback.

399
00:57:27,102 --> 00:57:39,702
I just think it's tough if you're trying to get a message to the CEO and you talk to someone whose close to them, there is the chance that it could backfire.

400
00:57:39,802 --> 00:57:42,002
Right person is close to them.

401
00:57:42,002 --> 00:57:44,102
It just depends on the CEOs personality.

402
00:57:44,102 --> 00:57:47,802
It depends on the organizational culture, but just being really honest here.

403
00:57:47,802 --> 00:57:57,402
Like, the person whose close to CEO could say, hey Gina like was speaking really badly about you and suddenly The CEOs.

404
00:57:57,402 --> 00:58:03,002
Like this is a disloyal employee, they aren't on board with the mission.

405
00:58:03,002 --> 00:58:07,102
They don't value me as a leader, whatever it is, they could misinterpret.

406
00:58:07,102 --> 00:58:18,002
Like there's kind of game of telephone sometimes with things like that even if you were trying to be helpful which I am sure most people are but it can backfire.

407
00:58:18,002 --> 00:58:47,102
So I just don't want to sort of sugarcoat, you know, I truly believe in feedback but I still don't think the systems that we have in place are set up to protect people enough that they can just freely share feedback with anyone at anytime and I don't want to encourage people to just go for it and then have it backfires.

408
00:58:47,102 --> 00:58:56,502
Like, even on this call, I don't want someone to leader email me and be like, hey, I followed your advice about being really candid and I got fired because the reality is that can't happen.

409
00:58:56,502 --> 00:58:59,402
Now, of course, we hope that never happens.

410
00:58:59,902 --> 00:59:08,102
Of course, I think things are shifting to the point where organizations are more receptive to feedback, they do view feedback as a positive thing.

411
00:59:08,102 --> 00:59:21,002
Even if it's technically — They know that they need to go above and beyond and to do more to help employees and to keep employees, it's still a really competitive job market.

412
00:59:21,002 --> 00:59:27,302
So there is an interest in making sure that companies are doing everything possible to retain employees.

413
00:59:27,702 --> 00:59:32,902
But I just wouldn't want that strategy to backfire on someone.

414
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:37,102
And I would feel bad if that happened.

415
00:59:37,102 --> 00:59:39,302
So I really can't encourage that.

416
00:59:39,602 --> 00:59:46,002
You obviously are the expert on your Company culture, the power dynamics, the relationships between people.

417
00:59:46,002 --> 00:59:53,202
If you have someone that you really trust and feel safe with I would recommend having the conversation if you want to have it, but framing it less.

418
00:59:53,202 --> 01:00:06,102
As the CEO is our problem and is causing all the problems to like, you know, I feel like a, you know, a more neutral way of phrasing it.

419
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:19,102
So, I feel like, you know, sometimes the blunt Is of the CEO is off-putting to employees or something like that and then maybe that feedback will get back to them in a constructive way.

420
01:00:19,402 --> 01:00:23,502
But I can't, I can't say go for it.

421
01:00:23,602 --> 01:00:24,102
Yep.

422
01:00:24,702 --> 01:00:26,302
That's good.

423
01:00:26,702 --> 01:00:58,702
And I think there's something to you know if an employee is still on board with the mission and believes in the team there, despite these things that they're experiencing from seat the CEO if they're able to Provide the feedback with the best intent, then wouldn't that get received hopefully better with the leader versus just like, you know, getting really hard and maybe there could be some bitterness and even resentment.

424
01:00:58,702 --> 01:01:07,402
It's like behind some words, it's like be very selective of the words to make sure that you're always in the best interest of the company.

425
01:01:07,802 --> 01:01:11,902
And then it's almost like the sandwich effect, right?

426
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:18,402
You give some of your best intentions and positive aspects, feedback of the company.

427
01:01:18,402 --> 01:01:22,402
And then you question it with some of the constructive feedback.

428
01:01:22,602 --> 01:01:23,102
You know.

429
01:01:23,802 --> 01:01:28,202
That could be a way to provide that feedback directly to L.

430
01:01:28,202 --> 01:01:28,502
Yeah.

431
01:01:29,902 --> 01:01:30,202
Yeah.

432
01:01:30,902 --> 01:01:32,602
We have a couple more questions.

433
01:01:34,302 --> 01:01:35,202
Let us get bees.

434
01:01:35,202 --> 01:01:36,602
Use question up there.

435
01:01:36,802 --> 01:01:45,902
It'd be great to get your thoughts on how companies can ensure psychological safety while soliciting candid feedback from the org.

436
01:01:47,502 --> 01:01:51,302
Yeah, so psychological safety is critical.

437
01:01:51,302 --> 01:01:56,202
We talk about it all the time and all voices, one of our advisors is Amy Edmondson.

438
01:01:56,202 --> 01:02:18,502
Who's a professor at Harvard Business School, and she's one of the foremost experts on psychological safety in the workplace and the way She defines psychological safety is the ability to fail or make mistakes without being punished and that can include the ability to speak up without being punished to.

439
01:02:18,502 --> 01:02:18,802
Right?

440
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:27,202
It's not just failing, but it's doing something and not feeling like you're going to be punished for it.

441
01:02:28,002 --> 01:02:33,302
So I think the best way to create it is to show it, right?

442
01:02:33,302 --> 01:02:42,702
Not Tell people, so if I go to an all hands, and I am like, hey we have a psychological psychologically safe environment, if you fail, it's okay those are just words.

443
01:02:42,702 --> 01:02:46,202
It doesn't really mean much to people to hear that.

444
01:02:46,402 --> 01:02:48,402
At the end of the day, they have to see it.

445
01:02:48,402 --> 01:03:03,502
I think in order to really internalize it and so what might be more effective for me as a leader or for a manager right on our team is to talk about the mistakes they have made talk about the places where they made the wrong decision, or they focused on the wrong.

446
01:03:03,702 --> 01:03:13,802
Initiative or, you know, they shot for the stars, and they missed, but to use it as an opportunity to show people that, it's okay, I am still here.

447
01:03:13,902 --> 01:03:15,702
We're still here, right?

448
01:03:15,802 --> 01:03:17,802
The organization is still doing well.

449
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:20,502
We learned a ton from it, and here's what we learned.

450
01:03:20,502 --> 01:03:23,002
And here's how we might do things differently in the future.

451
01:03:23,402 --> 01:03:31,702
Because I think you want to encourage people to take risks at work, you want to encourage them to try new things and to learn as they go.

452
01:03:31,902 --> 01:03:35,702
And I think the only way to do that, Is to show them that when they do it.

453
01:03:36,302 --> 01:03:44,102
It's encouraged and that they aren't being punished for when things don't work out.

454
01:03:45,702 --> 01:03:46,402
That's key.

455
01:03:47,902 --> 01:03:49,002
That's really good.

456
01:03:49,102 --> 01:03:50,102
That's a great.

457
01:03:50,102 --> 01:03:52,902
Great definition of psychological safety.

458
01:03:53,502 --> 01:03:54,902
We have got another question.

459
01:03:55,102 --> 01:03:55,402
Okay.

460
01:03:55,402 --> 01:04:01,002
Sorry, one, last thing I would add the same thing goes for feedback, so someone gives constructive feedback.

461
01:04:01,102 --> 01:04:01,402
You say.

462
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:02,802
Thank you for the feedback.

463
01:04:02,902 --> 01:04:04,802
Here's what I am To do as a result.

464
01:04:05,402 --> 01:04:08,902
You know, they don't get fired, they don't get demoted, they don't get, shut out of things.

465
01:04:09,202 --> 01:04:13,702
They don't get Scolded by someone right?

466
01:04:13,802 --> 01:04:16,302
Then the next time they feel more comfortable giving feedback.

467
01:04:16,302 --> 01:04:19,902
So that's kind of like the feedback version of psychological safety.

468
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:21,102
Mmm.

469
01:04:21,902 --> 01:04:22,802
So good.

470
01:04:23,102 --> 01:04:26,502
And I am seeing Clarissa and Bijou spots here.

471
01:04:28,002 --> 01:04:29,202
Thank you for the FEMA.

472
01:04:29,202 --> 01:04:35,802
Yes be the example show not tell and being vulnerable transparent As Leaders.

473
01:04:35,802 --> 01:04:41,602
There's such power in that When leaders can actually let down their guard.

474
01:04:41,902 --> 01:04:48,302
And constructively, you know, share that, and also a follow-up to what they're sharing.

475
01:04:49,202 --> 01:04:49,502
All right?

476
01:04:49,502 --> 01:04:51,002
We have got another question.

477
01:04:51,002 --> 01:04:53,902
Our final question and just a few minutes left.

478
01:04:53,902 --> 01:04:56,802
So if anyone else has questions, drop them right now.

479
01:04:57,702 --> 01:04:59,402
How do we help staff?

480
01:04:59,402 --> 01:05:06,602
And managers who have had negative experiences with feedback, you ready and open to feedback sessions.

481
01:05:08,602 --> 01:05:09,102
Who?

482
01:05:10,002 --> 01:05:20,502
Well, I think one question that I would ask that question is, what does it mean — experiences with feedback?

483
01:05:20,502 --> 01:05:20,902
Right.

484
01:05:20,902 --> 01:05:29,402
So I would really take a look at what's causing that person to feel like their experience was -.

485
01:05:30,502 --> 01:05:35,902
So one thing that happened a lot when I was starting all voices, I would talk to people.

486
01:05:35,902 --> 01:05:42,902
I would talk to HR leaders and lawyer Then sometimes most of the time they were like, this is a great idea.

487
01:05:42,902 --> 01:05:48,202
I love the idea of you know, easily accessible Anonymous reporting and feedback for employees.

488
01:05:48,502 --> 01:05:52,402
It's so needed some people were afraid.

489
01:05:52,902 --> 01:05:54,402
They were afraid.

490
01:05:54,902 --> 01:06:09,502
This was quoted to me many times of opening Pandora's Box because they thought if I let people share anonymously, I am going to get so much negative feedback that I am not even going to be able to handle it.

491
01:06:09,502 --> 01:06:24,202
And then I went to all these people responses and it's going to be really stressful and What's really interesting is I almost never hear that feedback anymore from customers from people and talking to from experts.

492
01:06:25,002 --> 01:06:38,202
I think one thing that's happened is that there has been a major shift over the last five years, in the value that we place on this type of feedback, getting to the people who need to hear it.

493
01:06:38,302 --> 01:06:41,302
So it started with the me to movement, right?

494
01:06:41,402 --> 01:06:51,902
It was like, all of a sudden, it was not an excuse, it was not a good excuse for a company leader to say, oh, I had no idea that was happening, right?

495
01:06:51,902 --> 01:06:55,002
Ignorance was not an out.

496
01:06:55,802 --> 01:07:00,102
People were being held accountable for the things that were happening in their companies.

497
01:07:00,302 --> 01:07:06,702
Whether they knew about them or not, and the only difference is if you know about it, you can do something about it.

498
01:07:06,902 --> 01:07:15,102
So I sometimes use the analogy or like the symbolism of like the ostrich with its head in the sand.

499
01:07:15,102 --> 01:07:20,702
Like you can be the ostrich but you're also not going to know what's actually going on.

500
01:07:20,702 --> 01:07:25,502
You're not going to be aware of reality and that's actually riskier.

501
01:07:25,702 --> 01:07:40,202
Knowing, and so I think having some type of conversation with staff or managers, who are afraid because I would say it's less about having had negative experiences and probably more fear of what's going to come up.

502
01:07:40,802 --> 01:07:51,002
And just tell them, at least if we know what people really feel, at least if we're aware of what's going on and what our employees reality is we can do something about it.

503
01:07:51,202 --> 01:07:55,502
If we don't know, we can't do anything about it and that's a much worse position for us.

504
01:07:55,602 --> 01:07:56,202
Us to be in.

505
01:07:57,802 --> 01:07:59,002
Knowledge is power.

506
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,402
So good.

507
01:08:02,402 --> 01:08:07,702
Wow, Claire, this has been a rich conversation.

508
01:08:08,302 --> 01:08:10,302
I am curious to know.

509
01:08:10,402 --> 01:08:16,301
So one, last question and maybe even point of advice that you would give to all of us here.

510
01:08:17,902 --> 01:08:20,102
How should we, how should we show up?

511
01:08:20,102 --> 01:08:21,502
What do you see for the future?

512
01:08:21,502 --> 01:08:26,902
You know, what are things that we could be doing and implementing today?

513
01:08:27,602 --> 01:08:34,602
In our circumstance, even if it's a mindset shift and you might have just been talking about that, you know what would you advise to us?

514
01:08:34,602 --> 01:08:45,102
Because obviously, people who came here to this event, we care about providing good feedback and making sure that the loops are there.

515
01:08:45,602 --> 01:08:46,801
What do you advise to us?

516
01:08:49,002 --> 01:08:50,301
Yeah, I think.

517
01:08:53,002 --> 01:09:02,402
I think, like I was just talking about, like, starting with this humility that, like, we don't know what, we don't know.

518
01:09:02,602 --> 01:09:20,902
It sounds so obvious, but there's information out there that we aren't aware of that someone has not felt comfortable bringing up to us and I think about this every day as a leader, there's definitely stuffed that I don't know about my organization about my team about specific team members, right?

519
01:09:21,301 --> 01:09:22,102
I just don't know.

520
01:09:22,402 --> 01:09:31,301
So the More that I can show up to make people feel comfortable, giving me that information sharing that feedback doing it in real time.

521
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:35,102
Not doing it when it's already too late, and they have already left the organization.

522
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:40,102
The better and, you know, going back to the pool that was shared at the beginning.

523
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:43,902
What's really interesting from what I have seen anecdotally?

524
01:09:43,902 --> 01:09:48,602
People are almost just as scared to share the positive feedback directly.

525
01:09:49,002 --> 01:09:55,402
And if you open up an anonymous Channel, I think you'd be really surprised by the amount of positive feedback.

526
01:09:55,402 --> 01:10:05,902
You will get two people who, for whatever reason, just don't feel safe sharing their opinion at all and the more that you can open up another.

527
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:16,202
Channel, the more you can say like okay I have the feedback that's coming to me directly, I have the feedback that is coming to me through these additional channels.

528
01:10:16,202 --> 01:10:40,302
I really feel like I have a more comprehensive understanding of what's going on with my employees and as a result, I am going to be better able to take care of them to see around corners to anticipate their needs and ultimately to build a healthy culture that really is Logically safe, and inclusive and welcoming for all employees.

529
01:10:42,102 --> 01:10:43,502
Thank you so much, Claire.

530
01:10:44,002 --> 01:10:45,302

00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:15,708
Now, we're going to jump into some q and A's and the topics are going to be very relevant for the time that we have right now.

25
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:19,808
So why don't we go ahead and set the stage and set the table for the conversation?

26
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,508
So why are we here today?

27
00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:31,908
You know, when you register for this event you probably register because Ariana and Joe are phenomenal leaders that you want to learn from.

28
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:33,908
And so we're going to get to that in a second.

29
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:39,008
But also you know, we're going to be discussing things that is really relevant to everyone.

30
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:42,708
That's on this event today and that's changing how we work.

31
00:19:43,008 --> 00:19:51,208
And when you look at the landscape of where we are today, it's a very, very relevant content relevant.

32
00:19:51,608 --> 00:20:01,508
Relevant content is being shared, across social media, news articles, every week, every two weeks you see different headlines being announced about the challenges of Shifting to remote.

33
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:04,808
The impact that has on employees, the impact that has on tension.

34
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:13,708
And so we want to bring leaders together to have this conversation of what's fueling, the change of work and how do we do it in a positive way?

35
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:16,908
What are the opportunities that also invites for us?

36
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:29,208
So we're going to be discussing the fundamental changes that we're seeing the Technology that are being shipped and develop to address the support this change and more importantly how to make sure we adapt well.

37
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:35,408
So we take care of our mental health, and we're not sacrificing it at the expense of the work that we're doing.

38
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:37,108
So talking about mental health.

39
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:42,508
Why don't we go ahead and pull up a pole on stage to just do a quick post check here?

40
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:59,508
We have a lot of people here, joining us, and we're going to talk about mental health and this is something that I have been working on, and I am just curious on how Often are you individually taken time on a mental health, practice to really fuel your well-being.

41
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,508
Is that daily?

42
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:01,808
Is it happening once a week?

43
00:21:01,908 --> 00:21:03,308
Is it happening once a month?

44
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:06,108
Or is that honestly not happening often enough?

45
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:17,908
Because we don't want, we don't prioritize these things we're left out on the other side of it, fully burnt out and then it becomes a bigger problem, not just for our employers for ourselves but also for our family.

46
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:21,308
So it looks like we're we have a pretty good mix of folks here.

47
00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:27,508
Here we have people that are doing something daily and I will be curious to learn what that is as we're in conversation.

48
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:31,208
If you want to share some tips and techniques, please drop that in chat.

49
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:37,608
Now, let us go ahead and dive into the core of our time together.

50
00:21:38,108 --> 00:21:42,608
And quickly, I want to touch base on the speakers that we have, and I just get myself out the way again.

51
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:44,708
My name is Roberto, you can call me Rob.

52
00:21:44,908 --> 00:21:54,208

54
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:05,608
Now, we have two very special guests and these are friends.

55
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:22,008
And I have been building relationships with both Ariana and Joe over the last year or so phenomenal leaders on the Forefront of the topics that were discussing today started with Arianna, Huffington founder and CEO of Thrive, Huffington Post and off the roof.

56
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:22,708
If teen books.

57
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:26,508
In fact, you know what, I meant, Ariana few months ago, she carried a book with her.

58
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:31,208
We're talking about the importance of sleep, and she took a book out of her bag and gave it to me.

59
00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:39,808
And I so have It's all my nice day and when I am trying to go to sleep, I am bussing that book open and reading a couple lines but it's 2016.

60
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:51,008
She also launched drive a leading Behavior change, technology company with the mission of changing how we work and how we live to put an end to the burnout epidemic.

61
00:22:51,008 --> 00:23:00,308
So, we got the right person here to discuss, mental health and Burdock and then Joe, Joe Thomas is the founder and co-founder CEO of loom.

62
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:05,108
We just talk to Joe inside the Vroom of how much my team uses loom.

63
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:07,408
In fact, there's a leaderboard at my team of common.

00:23:07,408 --> 00:23:11,308
Who's the leader at welcome using loom phenomenal product.

65
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:23,608

66
00:23:23,908 --> 00:23:27,508
But not only is he leading a phenomenal company with phenomenal growth.

00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:32,008
He also became recently a father to a beautiful baby girl.

I can attach to the title of founder and CEO comes way down the line, so the title of father.

69
00:23:38,608 --> 00:23:39,508
So congratulations.

70

00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:24,708
New York, okay?

86
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:31,908
My apartment in New York which is literally two minutes from our office.

87
00:24:32,908 --> 00:24:34,608
Fantastic.

88
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:36,508
Well, first of all, thank you both for take your time.

89
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:40,508
I know that time is the most valuable thing that we all have.

90
00:24:40,608 --> 00:24:44,208
And you guys are taking time to join this topic, this topic and conversation.

91
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,908
So, so thank you for that.

92
00:24:46,008 --> 00:24:46,808
And I want to jump.

93
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:52,708
Yeah, you say quickly that all of us are thriving, passionate users.

94
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:54,808
Sirs of welcome and of loom.

95
00:24:55,108 --> 00:24:57,608
So I am delighted to be with both of you.

96
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:01,008
You all are what I would say.

97
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:08,308
The bleeding edge, Ariana Ewing Thrive have built an Innovative Company products, and we love to hear it.

98
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:09,408
So, thank you for sharing that.

99
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:17,508
Yeah, and I think there's a I think it's something as it were pausing on and just talking about, you know, the importance of the work that you guys are doing.

100
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:23,808
I think that there is something to be said about building a company built for the future and where we're going right now.

101
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:27,508
And this is why I want to jump it to both sides of that conversation.

102
00:25:27,508 --> 00:25:41,408
One is mental health and the importance of that and the reality of where we are today, but also the technology that we're building to equip a distributed Workforce, we can work more efficiently and this, You world, right?

103
00:25:41,408 --> 00:25:46,408
And so, I want to jump right in, and I am going to kick off with Just Around burnout.

104
00:25:46,408 --> 00:25:59,308
And I know that there's a quick poll and looks like we have an audience that's being very attentive to that and doing some daily practices and some folks are not doing enough and not taking care of their well-being with the rituals.

105
00:25:59,608 --> 00:26:09,308
So, Ariana, you know, all of us feel the importance of burnout, we feel the weight of it as well, but it's not just us, the market is reacting to it.

106
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:16,008
The headlines are acted to it, you know, both on the employee side, but also leaders, you know, you shared an article.

107
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:30,108
I think it was last week that quote, 68 percent of employees and their leaders 81% of the c-suite says that improving their well-being is more important than advancing their careers, you know.

108
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:39,108
And, and to take that even further a few weeks before that you and your team got ahead of that as well and kicked off a mental health.

109
00:26:39,108 --> 00:26:40,108
Pledge I got picked up.

110
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:52,108
The New York Times hundreds of companies have supported it and it's good to see this on both sides right initiatives to address it and the reality of what it actually is.

111
00:26:52,108 --> 00:27:03,008
So I want to take some time and just set the stage on, you know, I have we have heard of burn out, you know, through the years but I have never felt a more tangible than it is today.

112
00:27:03,308 --> 00:27:04,108
How do we get here?

113
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:10,108
How do we get here to this point where it's like top of mind for everybody, what are the drought driving Factor?

114
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,508
Hers that you guys are seeing that's leading to this big problem.

115
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:19,908
Well Roberta, first of all burnout has been with us for years.

116
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:44,108
I was personally diagnosed with burnout in 2007, two years into building that cause when I Collapse and built and broke my cheekbone and the diagnosis was burnout at that time, as you implied, most people were not aware of Burnout, but it's been existing for decades.

117
00:27:44,508 --> 00:27:55,208
The silver lining of the pandemic is that now it fronts and center and it's not just front and center for the HR department.

118
00:27:55,208 --> 00:28:10,108
But for the c-suite for boards, we have finally recognized that employee well-being and mental health are fundamentally connected to business metrics, attrition retention product.

119
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,608
Tivity health care costs.

120
00:28:11,908 --> 00:28:43,708
So the reason why I am optimistic despite all the Dreadful numbers you cited is because finally we're acknowledging a problem, and we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix it and the fact that the majorities of employees and the c-suite, executives think that their life is more important than their career, it makes me feel like saying dada Shouldn't have known that for a while.

121
00:28:43,708 --> 00:29:01,108
We love our jobs and know the three of us really feel very blessed that we are doing jobs that we are passionate about but our jobs more important than Joe's little girl or your child or my children or the rest of our lives.

122
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:19,308
And for many, many years people acted, as though climbing the career ladder was more important than Anything, including their own health and withstand the skyrocketing increases in mental health problems, diabetes, obesity, Etc.

123
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:21,508
You know, Ariana.

124
00:29:21,508 --> 00:29:35,608
I just want to follow up on that and like, 100%, I think that there was a point in time, when burnout working till 2:00 3:00 in the morning, was a sign of honor.

125
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:38,408
It was like, I work hard, I work hard at all expenses.

126
00:29:38,408 --> 00:29:45,408
Like, especially when you work at a company that's growing and thriving and trying to run after the opportunity.

127
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:52,608
Many times it was like, honored, like this person is working hard and what I have realized as a leader with a family.

128
00:29:52,608 --> 00:30:00,508
Now, and my priorities are changing is like that actually isn't worth at the expense of all these other things in my life.

129
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:04,008
What are you seeing that change happen?

130
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:06,708
Like within leaders today and realizing that.

131
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,808
Okay, this is a burnout, I Am shifting.

132
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:15,408
Is there a shift you feel to prioritize mental health versus just like reporting that it's an issue?

133
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:16,808
Absolutely.

134
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:31,108
There is a shift and the shift is actually based on a scientific Foundation, which is that actually, when we take time to recharge to refuel to renew ourselves, we are more effective at work.

135
00:30:31,108 --> 00:30:35,908
So there is no trade-off which is what we believed for years and Elite.

136
00:30:35,908 --> 00:30:49,808
Athletes are at the Forefront who have Tom Brady speak about how prioritizing his sleep and what he eats and his recovery time has had Made it possible for him to win Super Bowls in his 40s.

137
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:56,608
And so, the connection between well-being and performance is now clear.

138
00:30:56,608 --> 00:31:14,408
We have really left behind, although we're still in a period of transition, the idea that downtime is a bug, and we realize that it may be a bag for software, but it's a feature for the human operating system.

139
00:31:15,108 --> 00:31:15,708
No Doubt.

140
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,308
Appreciate that Joe.

141
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:25,208
I mean, your dad now and I know we opened up with that, and I remember, this is what podcast recently, by the way, with juban, which is a phenomenal podcast.

142
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:43,308
If you guys haven't seen a grit from kind of Perkins, and you mentioned, like the importance of taking PTO, especially even as a leader, even as a CTO and taken parental leave, what was that like for like beating up to taking that break with a debt due for you and sort of the inner workings of that at your company.

143
00:31:44,008 --> 00:31:51,708
So first Want to say something back to Ariana really quickly, which is like the book you put out thrive in 2015.

144
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:53,408
I really do think as accelerated.

145
00:31:53,408 --> 00:32:11,008
The common lexicon that we have to be more preventative and how we kind of approach things like burnout, right burnout wasn't really a word you were diagnosed with it in 2007, you're like, what is that whereas in 2015 or 2020 to it is actually a commonly understood term.

146
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:15,408
And so if you just even understand what the concept is, you can start to be more preventive with it.

147
00:32:15,408 --> 00:32:24,908
And so, I think that's where it really does tie in well, with paternity leave because to me I was very nervous about taking extended time off.

148
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:29,808
It would be the first time and six and a half years that I took longer than a week, long vacation.

149
00:32:30,108 --> 00:32:39,808
And ultimately, I came back on the other side of paternity leave feeling like I had recharged the tank in a way that I hadn't since the very beginning of Bloom.

150
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:45,908
And I have been a significantly better CEO, even with having a brand-new born.

151
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:49,708
With in my household day in and day out for the last three months.

152
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:53,408
Since then, like you would think that I would become a worse or less productive.

153
00:32:53,408 --> 00:32:56,808
CEO knows like the opposite because not only was it.

154
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,408
I had the time off that allowed for me to recharge the batteries.

155
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:06,108
It's also allowed for me to kind of be what I would say in terms of being a father.

156
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:09,008
I talked about this concept of like Ambien anxiety.

157
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:12,908
Is like how am I spending my time outside of work?

158
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,808
And, you know, that you can't work 24/7.

159
00:33:14,808 --> 00:33:19,108
So it's like, what are you for down, time to go like workout and exercise?

160
00:33:19,108 --> 00:33:21,008
Do you sit down and have dinner with your spouse?

161
00:33:21,008 --> 00:33:29,208
Do you end up doing the lazy thing, which is Doom scrolling on social media, like all of these sorts of things that you may spend your time?

162
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,608
Obviously, some of those are stacked ranked, very differently.

163
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:45,908
But any time that I spend with my family, while I do my wife and my daughter, there's none of that no anxiety, no guilt and so the recharge that I get since having a child and then being able to come back and show up at work, the like my battery is recharged.

164
00:33:46,008 --> 00:33:48,608
Is better than it ever has been before at Loom.

165
00:33:48,608 --> 00:34:00,808
And so taking time off, spending time with family, enables me to be a better CEO and I have 3 months of data now, so I will check back in a year to be like and it's still true but like as of today it is definitely true.

166
00:34:01,908 --> 00:34:02,708
Fantastic.

167
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:03,808
You know, you know what's interesting.

168
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:07,808
Joe, I think you know, we always hear about Lee from the top.

169
00:34:07,908 --> 00:34:12,108
So like what you sort of like, do you know, your employees follow as well?

170
00:34:12,108 --> 00:34:14,208
And I think this is one of those things, right?

171
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,507
Like taking a month, off taken, three months off, whatever.

172
00:34:16,507 --> 00:34:17,208
I mean, whatever.

173
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,507
That looks like it's important.

174
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:19,808
All right.

175
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:26,308
So as something balanced armatures on a Segway into that, right, like, let us talk about thriving at work.

176
00:34:26,507 --> 00:34:36,308
And I think, you know, as Leaders, we all want each teammate, at our companies, to thrive, to be, well, to do the best work.

177
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:40,708
But saying in actually supporting it is two different things.

178
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:42,507
We can say that all we want.

179
00:34:42,608 --> 00:34:45,908
And then on top of that, we're in a remote first world.

180
00:34:46,108 --> 00:34:48,108
And this is brings a lot of change.

181
00:34:49,108 --> 00:34:50,208
What does that look like?

182
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:53,007
How do we be more attention about supporting our employees?

183
00:34:54,208 --> 00:35:00,808
For now, we may, we may never see in the office or it's going to be much more or less frequent than ever before.

184
00:35:00,908 --> 00:35:04,208
This is these are the screens that we engage with them on.

185
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:11,008
Why have you seen work on like empowering employees, to take care of themselves?

186
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:14,108
Outside of just like, showing by example?

187
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:19,208
Ariana.

188
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:38,408
I think that first of all, what you said about all these new practices starting at the top is incredibly important because we are still in the middle of a cultural transition.

189
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:46,208
And so, a lot of people feel they need cultural permission to take care of themselves.

190
00:35:46,808 --> 00:36:12,008
And when we launched with any company, we like to bring into a blood from stories from their leaders about how they are recharging, even small things that we just launched at Paramount and Bob Beckel, their CEO told the story at the fireside chat that we launched with of how he used to go straight to his phone.

191
00:36:12,508 --> 00:36:15,708
And now he takes five minutes.

192
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:18,508
He lives by a He makes a cup of coffee.

193
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:37,008
Go sit on his porch said, saying that his intention for the day and remembers what he's grateful for and then goes through his phone now, that small and in fact, I drive, we talked, we talked about micro steps.

194
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:43,808
Small daily incremental, steps that become gradually healthier habits.

195
00:36:44,408 --> 00:36:46,408
And that way, it's not overwhelming.

196
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:52,908
Me and that micro step of how you start your day and how you end your day?

197
00:36:54,108 --> 00:37:09,608
By as Joe said, instead of Doom's crawling doing something that connects you with your family or recharges you before you go to sleep, are absolutely key micro steps.

198
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:14,508
Now Ariana like let us talk about how do you bring that into the workplace?

199
00:37:14,508 --> 00:37:21,008
Because we talked about a lot of mental health, for you, the individual, and we talked about humanizing the workplace and what that looks like.

200
00:37:21,008 --> 00:37:31,808
And I love to segue right into Thrive because you talked about bringing your personal self, your host self and sharing a glimpse of what really matters to you as an employee of a bigger company.

201
00:37:33,008 --> 00:37:33,908
Why don't we can you?

202
00:37:33,908 --> 00:37:34,808
Can you just T up?

203
00:37:34,808 --> 00:37:37,408
What, what, what our Thrive resets?

204
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:45,608
And then got a little bit, surprised I have a reset Ricky said I have my reset and it'd be good to kind of give the audience a glimpse of what resets our go.

205
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:48,908
I would love for you to introduce it and talk about the science behind it.

206
00:37:49,508 --> 00:38:03,508
So I thrive our Behavior change methodology is based on meeting employees, whatever they are on teams on slack, on welcome, whatever medium they're using.

207
00:38:03,508 --> 00:38:04,508
We want to meet them.

208
00:38:04,508 --> 00:38:34,808
They're both with this micro steps around, sleep Food Connection, Ian Focus, but also with the 62nd interventions that we call reset which are based on the Neuroscience that tells us that while stress is unavoidable, cumulative, stress is avoidable and it takes 60 seconds to move us from the sympathetic to the parasympathetic nervous system.

209
00:38:35,508 --> 00:38:45,008
And therefore interrupt that cycle that, if it's not interrupted can To high blood pressure or binge drinking or binge eating to be able to wind down.

210
00:38:45,008 --> 00:38:57,608
So my favorite feature in our platform as Roberto, you know, is reset because you bring together things that you love about your life.

211
00:38:57,608 --> 00:39:00,908
And whenever you are stressed, you played.

212
00:39:00,908 --> 00:39:25,808
Also, we believe that the we played at the beginning of meetings, to build social capital who literally spinning wheel and One of us plays there reset and it gives us a glimpse as we're going to see now into a colleagues life that helps us build the social capital that we lose when we are not all physically together.

213
00:39:25,808 --> 00:39:26,808
Bumping into each.

214
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:33,408
Other asking each other more intimate questions about our lives are weak and Etc.

215
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:34,808
Fantastic.

216
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:40,308
I mean with that if we can roll the clip of Ariana's, and then we will switch over to my reset as well.

217
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:15,108
We just saw a little bit of a glimpse Ariana to your reset.

218
00:40:15,608 --> 00:40:19,308
I love seeing that let us play minds, and then we will talk about it here in a second.

219
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:02,008
There it is, there it is.

220
00:41:02,608 --> 00:41:03,008
Joe.

221
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:08,608
Yeah, I mean do we gonna have to get yours going next time and would love to see your family?

222
00:41:09,308 --> 00:41:15,808
But Ariana that's I mean I just think about that was pooling photos last night together to kind of get the reset going.

223
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:17,708
But yeah, talk to us about that.

224
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:21,208
How has it been received who companies that you're working with your team?

225
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:22,308
What's what changes?

226
00:41:24,408 --> 00:41:37,408
People love it and you know you can have multiple resets share them with colleagues and friends and you can build research for your children, your family.

227
00:41:37,808 --> 00:41:45,708
It's a very simple way to start this journey of well-being or to add these well-being practice into your life.

228
00:41:45,708 --> 00:42:14,308
You know, in the Paul people said that they have these little well-being Rituals once a day or once a week, or once a month, but you can have them once an hour and if you bring them into your workflow and interrupt the stress cycle, and it can be incredibly effective and Thrive we bring them into call centers.

229
00:42:14,308 --> 00:42:18,408
We bring them into the lives of Frontline workers.

230
00:42:18,408 --> 00:42:42,308
It's not just for people with desk jobs and the I can't play this resets on the phones and also everything comes pre-loaded with, with ready-made resets where thing over play one at the end that helps us take the breath.

231
00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:44,908
Remember what we're grateful for etcetera?

232
00:42:46,008 --> 00:42:46,608
Fantastic.

233
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:47,208
Now, I love it.

234
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:52,808
I mean I just saw Minds come together for today's event, and I am looking forward to it.

235
00:42:52,808 --> 00:43:01,008
I just I want to keep it shortcut on my phone because you guys know things, get pretty tense at the top and it's good to Anchor back to what's important.

236
00:43:03,508 --> 00:43:11,908
All right, so I want to jump into Switching gears here and Joe, you talk about something, which I think you wrote, You have right about this.

237
00:43:11,908 --> 00:43:21,108
You talked about this and it's talking about the change of what's happening with remote and employees that are now distributed.

238
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:26,308
And the importance of us understanding that work is fundamentally changing.

239
00:43:27,308 --> 00:43:35,508
You know, I think if you look at work being no longer a place you go to But it's something that you do now.

240
00:43:35,508 --> 00:43:37,908
If we just anchor on that for a second, right?

241
00:43:38,108 --> 00:43:39,408
Work is no longer a place.

242
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,308
You go to, but it's something that you do.

243
00:43:41,408 --> 00:43:45,908
Historically, you would think generationally, you know, Dad goes to work.

244
00:43:45,908 --> 00:43:48,708
Mom goes to work, like they're going to work.

245
00:43:48,808 --> 00:43:57,008
Now you're literally, you are where you are and you do the work and the tip, the question becomes, how do we do that?

246
00:43:57,008 --> 00:44:02,908
Well, you know, our friend Stewart Butterfield over a slack says we only have about 10% of the tools.

247
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:07,108
Needed to do this well and serve this shift in the market.

248
00:44:07,408 --> 00:44:16,608
You would argue that slack all of us use slack and it's the thing that connects all of us but even the leader and the CEO of slack says, we're just scratching.

249
00:44:16,608 --> 00:44:20,708
The surface is only 10% of the tools needed to do the job.

250
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:28,408
Well, and then as we talk about the headlines, you know, there's a headline every single week company is announcing their own remote.

251
00:44:28,408 --> 00:44:31,808
Other companies saying, you have to show up or else, right?

252
00:44:31,808 --> 00:44:32,908
And there's like that.

253
00:44:33,308 --> 00:44:35,208
A war happening right now.

254
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:39,208
And some people think that hybrid might be the worst of Both Worlds.

255
00:44:39,308 --> 00:44:47,808
And some people are like, no, like in offices where it's at, some people are very Progressive, and they're saying, we're going all in on remote where do you stand?

256
00:44:48,008 --> 00:44:48,708
This is open.

257
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:49,608
Question for both of you.

258
00:44:49,608 --> 00:44:56,208
Where do you stand, what's your thoughts on like hybrid and remote is remote more Equitable as hybrid?

259
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:56,908
What's your current take?

260
00:44:56,908 --> 00:44:59,608
As I know you guys are on the front lines of that yourself.

261
00:45:00,508 --> 00:45:02,408
So I will do a little preamble.

262
00:45:03,108 --> 00:45:03,408
Room.

263
00:45:03,408 --> 00:45:18,408
And one of our original thesis for building what we were building because I do think it's relevant just in terms of thematically what we're all navigating, which is when we built a synchronous video for the workplace, that was what we launched in June of 2016, right?

264
00:45:18,408 --> 00:45:23,608
So this was three and a half years in advance of covid and everybody being shelter in place.

265
00:45:23,608 --> 00:45:27,908
And really, truly understanding, what is feasible with remote work.

266
00:45:27,908 --> 00:45:33,108
And so are, we always said that we're not necessarily a remote.

267
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:39,408
Only tool, although we are very valuable for those who are communicating in a remote context because we were growing really well.

268
00:45:39,408 --> 00:45:45,808
And folks were using us, even if they were in office because you know, it's hybrid as a full spectrum, right?

269
00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:48,008
It is you're a hybrid company.

270
00:45:48,008 --> 00:45:56,108
If you have every single person in office, but one person decides to work from home for per day, or you are still a hybrid company.

271
00:45:56,108 --> 00:46:01,108
If everybody is fully remote, but then we get to people who go into the office once or twice per week.

272
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:01,708
I like that.

273
00:46:01,808 --> 00:46:17,708
That's still technically a Hybrid and so for us when we, when we were thinking about, what is this change, that we are all navigating in the first and second quarter of 2020, when we were all just thinking about, what does this mean for us as individuals?

274
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,108
What does it mean for our company's?

275
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:26,308
What does it mean for potentially the products that we're building in order to help facilitate distributed and remote teams in communicating with one another?

276
00:46:27,808 --> 00:46:31,908
I kept reminding the company that this is a multi-decade change.

277
00:46:32,108 --> 00:46:34,708
Like we're not going to Of the wand and figure this out.

278
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:39,608
Because when we go back into office, when we go back home, how often receive one another?

279
00:46:39,608 --> 00:46:53,608
Like these are really big long scale and large experiments that were generally running right now and Humanity doesn't necessarily change overnight when we're talking about the global population and how they think about the intersection of work and life.

280
00:46:53,908 --> 00:47:11,408
And so for us and Loom, the way that we personally think about it right now is we want to live the idealistic of version of this like we It to push for what is what we believe that Ideal World is where, like work is not what, like, where you are, it's what you do.

281
00:47:11,608 --> 00:47:14,008
And so how do you end up enabling that?

282
00:47:14,008 --> 00:47:25,508
It's that you enable individuals to have as much freedom and flexibility as possible because you actually fundamentally trust that individuals are going to adhere to whatever is best for them.

283
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:34,408
If that means going into the office, once a quarter, then and working at home for the rest of the time, like, I Mean please do that.

284
00:47:34,408 --> 00:47:37,708
And how frequently do you want to get together with the broad company?

285
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:39,308
Or your department, or your team?

286
00:47:39,508 --> 00:47:43,808
Like, we're all figuring that out right now, but ultimately what that is fundamentally rooted in.

287
00:47:44,008 --> 00:47:51,508
If you treat the individual with trust then you can enable them with freedom and flexibility, and we will figure out how to do that over the course of time.

288
00:47:51,608 --> 00:48:02,908
Now there is a whole host of hairy challenges that we gotta tackle over the next couple decades, like I was saying and Stewart Butterfield is also talking about the fact that like we are at 10% of the tooling that we potentially need to.

289
00:48:03,108 --> 00:48:10,308
Be able to solve this, what we wanted to live, the ideal version and what we want to help pull that potential ideal future into the present as quickly as possible.

290
00:48:12,508 --> 00:48:15,608
Fantastic well-well, put Ariana.

291
00:48:19,808 --> 00:48:21,408
Okay, Ned one thing.

292
00:48:21,408 --> 00:48:40,508
If it were not just a 10% of the technology we need, I think we are a 10% of the humanity because one of the things that we are realizing is that we are not going to be able to figure it all out and deal with his hairy challenges.

293
00:48:40,508 --> 00:48:49,408
If we think everything is going to be solved by technology, I think technology can help us ironically Rico.

294
00:48:49,608 --> 00:48:53,008
Act with a deeper part of ourselves as we are doing with reset.

295
00:48:53,008 --> 00:48:57,508
So, you are doing with them, welcome platform or the loom platform.

296
00:48:57,508 --> 00:49:07,908
But we need to reconnect to a deeper part of ourselves where we can find our creativity, our empathy, our peace, and strength, and resilience.

297
00:49:08,308 --> 00:49:19,408
And if we don't do that, the future is going to be very difficult because we are living in extremely uncertain, and turbulent times, there is absolutely nothing.

298
00:49:19,508 --> 00:49:25,908
Thing that assures us that's going to change.

299
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:39,008
So resilience is more important than ever but it's a human quality, and I am a big believer in technology, helping us get there.

300
00:49:39,308 --> 00:49:45,608
But we need to realize that this human upscaling has to be part of the future.

301
00:49:47,108 --> 00:49:56,608
I couldn't by the way, in terms of resiliency, I think that we all kind of like see and feel it right now where we just came out of a multi-year global pandemic.

302
00:49:56,608 --> 00:50:04,008
And now we're about to go into potentially a multi-year global recession based off of like all leading indicators at this point.

303
00:50:04,008 --> 00:50:10,608
So, when it comes to resiliency, like another, we feel like we just got sucked through something so big.

304
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:16,208
But on the other side of it, where, like, potentially facing another major change will impact our day-to-day.

305
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:17,008
Lives as well.

306
00:50:17,008 --> 00:50:22,608
And so resiliency just wanted to like, triple emphasize with Arianna said is, I think it's so important.

307
00:50:23,108 --> 00:50:23,908
No doubt.

308
00:50:24,008 --> 00:50:36,908
And I think, you know, I think the conversation we're having here about work, but also the people side of it, just goes hand-in-hand, and I feel like over the last few years has become so much more important about employee well-being.

309
00:50:37,308 --> 00:50:46,108
Like the person that you provide space to come to do the work, not just like the skills that they provide, but the individual and Joe, I think you put it really well.

310
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:55,708
Well, around optimizing for the person when you optimize for the employee, when you optimize for the person, if they want to come in once a quarter.

311
00:50:55,708 --> 00:51:00,808
And that's the best thing for them than having to trust that, that's the best thing for them.

312
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:04,108
And the question is, how do you support that and make that habit?

313
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:20,108
You know, one of the biggest arguments that we see or might be, might be fading away now since data showing otherwise, that going remote, having folks choose nice, Lisa and If impact on connection and culture within a company, right?

314
00:51:20,108 --> 00:51:28,808
That's one side of the argument is like, well, if I don't have, I built my coaching because there's a good micro kitchen because, you know, we got all these perks.

315
00:51:28,808 --> 00:51:30,608
You can take the slide from the third floor.

316
00:51:30,608 --> 00:51:35,808
Down to the first floor, you can take a cool bike from one office to another office when that goes away.

317
00:51:36,108 --> 00:51:38,908
And this is the beauty of I think about like, the shift that's happening.

318
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:46,108
Because when that goes away, leaders and companies have to think very differently about what matters to the employee.

319
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:46,508
Lee.

320
00:51:46,608 --> 00:51:57,908
And I think also, when you look at all these circumstances that were talking about pandemic War recession, if we're all honest, we have taken inventory of what's important for us in our lives.

321
00:51:58,408 --> 00:52:00,508
And data is starting to show that as well.

322
00:52:01,608 --> 00:52:03,208
What do you guys think it's possible?

323
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:13,408
You guys think it's possible for us as we're going more remote, more distributed to still build amazing, cultures, amazing companies and enable people feel connected.

324
00:52:14,908 --> 00:52:16,008
Absolutely.

325
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:16,808
Yes.

326
00:52:17,808 --> 00:52:24,008
I think Joe said it best that it's not really about where you work.

327
00:52:27,508 --> 00:52:31,408
I think it's really how we show up at every moment in our lives.

328
00:52:31,408 --> 00:52:32,908
How present are we?

329
00:52:33,808 --> 00:52:35,208
How fully engaged?

330
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:35,608
Are we?

331
00:52:35,608 --> 00:52:47,408
You know, in something you said, Roberto you have one of my favorite quotes by Maya Angelou, you should add it into your next reset.

332
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:51,708
The wisest thing you can do is be present in the present.

333
00:52:51,808 --> 00:52:52,708
Gratefully.

334
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:56,808
That's a very different way of experiencing life.

335
00:52:56,908 --> 00:52:57,708
Find work.

336
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:02,508
Then we have been used to, which is Being not at all.

337
00:53:02,508 --> 00:53:16,208
In the present breathlessly you know living life as though we're always running out of time and that's been the experience that I grew up with.

338
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:23,408
You know, I am older than all of you but I don't think yours has been that different and now we are changing that.

339
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:27,108
So this is kind of incredible Catalyst.

340
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:30,608
You know how someone said that Christ is a terrible thing to waste.

341
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:41,708
So let us not waste this crisis and last, let us be incredibly optimistic about what we are building because who wants to go back to the past?

342
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:44,408
Fantastic.

343
00:53:44,908 --> 00:53:54,808
And I was just going to say really quickly, that, you know, we're a lot of folks say that time is the most precious resource, which I agree, but I would like argue that we should extend it to.

344
00:53:54,808 --> 00:54:01,408
It's more like attention and intention of where you end up, allocating your focus.

345
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:16,308
And so that whole being present in the present is such a gift that I think that in terms of building connection and community in a largely distributed world, I still think that were humans and biology.

346
00:54:16,308 --> 00:54:24,408
Like, it takes a very long time for like biology to evolve and so there's a very real half-life that comes from getting a group of folks together.

347
00:54:24,408 --> 00:54:52,208
Like, I was fortunate enough to get to spend time with Ariana at the loom off site a couple weeks ago, where we got everybody together for the first time in two and a half years and it was 30 minutes into the welcome kind of like happy hour horderves time that illuminates were just head over heels in terms of spending time with one another Either, but I think that what's really exciting about things like off sites when you're primarily distributed is that you have the intention of creating what I think is like, accelerates.

348
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:56,108
Building of relationships, which is unique shared experiences.

349
00:54:56,308 --> 00:55:05,008
If you can have a unique shared experiences with another or group of other people, then you can build really accelerated connection and Community across a group.

350
00:55:05,008 --> 00:55:13,208
So even if you only get together within your team or Department once every six months and then a company, once a year, the half-life of the value of that is so strong.

351
00:55:13,408 --> 00:55:25,708
A digital actually can enable you to build connection and community in a way that I think that we're just scratching the surface onto its Shameless plug a sink video is an unbelievably powerful way to build connection and Community.

352
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:33,308
I could show you our Loom work space where somebody was sharing a video from Loom, a couple of years ago that now has gone viral.

353
00:55:33,308 --> 00:55:34,008
In our workspace.

354
00:55:34,008 --> 00:55:40,908
That a bunch of folks is watching where we make it a hot wing challenge together and like that is then getting a bunch of other illuminates to talk about.

355
00:55:40,908 --> 00:55:45,808
They have done the hot wing challenge together and so all of this connection and Community is being built asynchronously.

356
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:55,108
So I think we're just scratching the surface there, but I really do think that intention around unique shared experiences, you're going to absolutely do both and digital and physical worlds.

357
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:58,408
No doubt, no doubt, loves this conversation.

358
00:55:58,408 --> 00:56:01,308
I do want to shift over to the audience.

359
00:56:01,308 --> 00:56:05,108
It looks like we have a lot of questions, queued up in the audience.

360
00:56:05,108 --> 00:56:07,908
We're going to start shifting gears on that side.

361
00:56:08,008 --> 00:56:12,808
And so, I think for the next few minutes, we're going to start taking some questions.

362
00:56:13,008 --> 00:56:15,808
So why don't we go ahead and bring question up on stage?

363
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:25,808
I love to hear ideas on how we encourage employees to build and maintain those connections when several are remote or hype.

364
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:43,208
I think this goes back to, you know, like I don't see all my peers, I don't see all my colleagues all the time I used to bump into them, you know, at the micro kitchen and now people are distributed, or I am working from Boston and you know our team I have one of my leaders is in Hawaii.

365
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:46,808
Another one of my leaders was in Poland last week, I am in Boston.

366
00:56:46,808 --> 00:56:48,708
Now what does that look like?

367
00:56:48,908 --> 00:56:52,208
Are you guys seeing like effective ways of building that connection?

368
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:57,808
I mean Joe you talked about, you know, async videos and sort of The building connection, can we expand on that?

369
00:56:57,808 --> 00:57:00,808
Because that feels like a good segue into this one.

370
00:57:02,008 --> 00:57:21,608
Yeah, I mean I think that it starts from the very beginning of an employee life cycle where a very popular use cases that instead of somebody sending an introductory like two or three sentence note, somebody is that true required on day, one to record a loom introducing themselves, and we have lumet intros and so that sent a bunch of people leave reactions.

371
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:24,508
They're actually like know where that person lived over the course of time.

372
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:28,308
And like, do they have a dog or a cat like what's their General interests?

373
00:57:28,308 --> 00:57:35,708
And so, watching a video of somebody walking through that with, like, Men passion about what they are, what are the things that they genuinely care about?

374
00:57:35,708 --> 00:58:09,208
I think is super, super powerful, and then from there, if you kind of create the opportunity for people to bring their whole selves, to work and sharing things of interest to them, one of the things that Ariana really did want to, we have to follow through on a loom specifically, but one of the things that you shared when you're up on stage, is the fact that you ask employees what matters most to them and it was crazy when you were hiring a certain employee at I have where they had said that they weren't able to do that for six months and at Thrive you're like no, no, you're doing this like every week right in.

375
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:14,508
So like, understanding what is generally interesting to an individual is so important.

376
00:58:14,508 --> 00:58:27,308
And so what we need to follow through on with loom is that I said at the off-site you need to pick one other person to be your accountability partner to make sure that you check in and making sure that individual is doing what they're supposed to be doing over the course of time.

377
00:58:27,308 --> 00:58:38,508
Like, Josh when is an engineer at Loom, and he and I decided to partner up, and he said She wanted to spend time talking to every single one of his family members each week, because he feels like he's drifted apart over the last year.

378
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:42,408
And so like that, brings him a lot of energy and joy if he just gives them a call.

379
00:58:43,008 --> 00:58:51,508
So this is one where I think that to me, I said that my practice was meditating for at least 15 minutes per day because it's my leading indicator behavior.

380
00:58:51,908 --> 00:58:54,308
And it's obviously, you know what to do.

381
00:58:54,308 --> 00:58:55,508
But do you do it in practice?

382
00:58:55,508 --> 00:59:08,908
And so, if you understand what's really important at an individual level, than you can build deeper relationships with them, over the course of time, I am 100% I want to follow up on that because Ariana you told me the same thing and I can't shake it from my head.

383
00:59:08,908 --> 00:59:20,108
It was I remember when we were having a conversation couple months ago, and we're talking about the importance of getting to know your employees and the first question you ask you flip it around and is not what can you do?

384
00:59:20,108 --> 00:59:22,408
But what is most important for you in the season?

385
00:59:22,408 --> 00:59:31,608
And we went off and talking about examples of that and let us say, for instance, you know, you have a mom who was a busy mom, and she's the most important.

386
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:37,308
In her life right now is her daughter's recital and the practice that happens for the next three months.

387
00:59:37,308 --> 00:59:43,708
For that to happen, which means that I can't really attend, you know, Friday, 2:00 meetings.

388
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:50,908
And so now as a manager, I know that for Samantha, that is the most important thing that matters to her in the season.

389
00:59:50,908 --> 00:59:52,008
So, I am not going to require.

390
00:59:52,008 --> 00:59:54,708
I am not even going to book a time on a meeting, on the front, by the way.

391
00:59:54,708 --> 01:00:01,508
Friday meeting shouldn't exist, but I am not going to book a meeting on a Friday afternoon for Samantha because I know that's the most important thing.

392
01:00:01,608 --> 01:00:07,608
NG for her, but it seems like Joe's taken that advice as well, pretty tactically Ariana.

393
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:09,008
Can you expand on that a little bit more?

394
01:00:09,008 --> 01:00:09,208
Yeah.

395
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:16,808
Actually it's going goes back to a Joe said about the need to be much more intentional in a hybrid world.

396
01:00:17,308 --> 01:00:31,208
And for us, it starts with onboarding with all the companies who work with, whether they are Walmart or a small, high-growth startup onboarding is sacred.

397
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:31,508
Now.

398
01:00:32,108 --> 01:00:33,608
It's the opportunity.

399
01:00:33,608 --> 01:00:39,008
We have to embed the culture from day one.

400
01:00:39,508 --> 01:00:49,308
So we interview the entry interview starts with his questionable.

401
01:00:49,308 --> 01:01:13,808
If you both mention which is quite important to you, I don't work and how can afford so it can be What's important to me take my daughter to school every morning at 7 or to go to the my daughter's recital on Friday after whatever it is make it even larger.

402
01:01:14,108 --> 01:01:29,208
You can actually And the way you interact with that employee, and if you also have an accountability buddy, then it makes it much more likely that you're going to achieve your goals.

403
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:38,108
And then you're going to be much happier at work and much less stressed about navigating this intersection between life and work.

404
01:01:38,108 --> 01:01:58,608
And what we do on day, one is also helped each new employee create their own personalized reset And that way that's a tool that we have to play a team meeting to play individually by feeding it into slack or team, so or any method of communication.

405
01:01:58,908 --> 01:02:08,108
And these are two of the small rituals, there are dozens of others that we can embed in the workflow to interrupt the stress cycle.

406
01:02:09,908 --> 01:02:10,708
Fantastic know.

407
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:12,708
I think that's, that's a such a powerful question.

408
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:15,608
So, simple, Joe is such a simple question, right?

409
01:02:15,608 --> 01:02:21,808
But when you like dissect, it was like this game-changing, like just starting with what's most important to that individual.

410
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:27,208
I want to segue into this next question which is a real good one.

411
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:31,308
Especially in the tension of remote and hybrid from Howard.

412
01:02:31,308 --> 01:02:51,508
He says, curious as to how ad-hoc hallway and water cooler conversations can be recreated in this hybrid world and I remember My time at what time I Google I you know, how always goes our micro kitchen because it was a fantastic place to load up on snacks, but also make coffee or whatever it is and you do bump into people, right?

413
01:02:51,508 --> 01:02:57,008
And you do get the sense of like Community because you see the folks that you're working with.

414
01:02:57,908 --> 01:03:00,408
How are you guys handling that at your company's?

415
01:03:04,908 --> 01:03:18,708
So this one I think is like, really challenging specifically because, yeah, in the sense that what are the very nuanced human engagements and interactions that happen in office.

416
01:03:19,108 --> 01:03:32,908
That I think that like we were saying we're two years into a multi-decade change and so what problems are being solved today, it's the biggest ones that are lined to the most direct Roi for a business, right?

417
01:03:32,908 --> 01:03:39,508
So like, can I communicate Directly uncritical work streams, can I actually drive a project forward?

418
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:44,508
But some things like, the Nuance interaction around water coolers or hallway, talk.

419
01:03:44,508 --> 01:03:46,508
I think is one that will absolutely be solved.

420
01:03:46,508 --> 01:03:53,508
I think that, you know, I could continue to talk about Loom but like I will talk about a few other ones where slack built something called the Huddle's, right?

421
01:03:53,508 --> 01:03:57,808
So that makes it very easy to potentially like jump into a quick call.

422
01:03:57,808 --> 01:04:04,308
There's other software's out there like team flow or tandem or uncheck gathered at Town.

423
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:14,908
Town that allows that tries to make it a little bit more 3D where you can walk around and be in an office setting to like run into folks throughout even if you're engaging in a digital space.

424
01:04:14,908 --> 01:04:20,708
And, so I think that there's a long way to go to potentially solve on this front and that we don't necessarily have it today.

425
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:30,408
The way that Loom is doing it specifically is that we're asynchronous by Nature so folks can record and share a video, but then we built this concept of trending within a workspace.

426
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:36,108
And so depending on what Loom is getting Emoji, reacted With and comments, right?

427
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:45,808
And a lot of times the loons that Trend are not directly work-related their actual cultural related so illuminates decided to start doing plant tours around their home.

428
01:04:45,808 --> 01:04:49,108
So they're like two or three minutes where they'd show off the plants at their home.

429
01:04:49,108 --> 01:04:57,308
And now we have 40 plant tours across the loom workspace and a genuinely became the interesting thing about culture as like the remix component.

430
01:04:57,308 --> 01:05:00,508
So at the beginning it was a full five-minute Plant tour by the Yen.

431
01:05:00,508 --> 01:05:04,408
People were doing the fastest plant tours east of the Mississippi, and so they were like running.

432
01:05:04,508 --> 01:05:06,508
Earning around their hive and like this plant, this plant.

433
01:05:06,508 --> 01:05:15,608
And, so I think that to me, there're ways of you would an asynchronous way, but ultimately I think that those like creative Innovative bouncing conversations off of each other.

434
01:05:15,808 --> 01:05:22,008
We still got a long way to go to solve that problem but I do see software's that are trying to tackle it, and they're really, really interesting.

435
01:05:22,008 --> 01:05:23,608
So just a little bit more time.

436
01:05:24,108 --> 01:05:24,508
Yeah.

437
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:25,808
No doubt, no doubt.

438
01:05:25,808 --> 01:05:26,408
Joe I live.

439
01:05:26,408 --> 01:05:34,308
I love the long term perspective to the problem that you're bringing here, I think it's really important to understand that we're just in the very beginning.

440
01:05:34,508 --> 01:05:39,608
It's of his big Monumental shift in the way that we work and that is really important, right?

441
01:05:39,608 --> 01:05:45,908
For all of us, not just as Leaders, but also employees in the workforce that we're adapting we have to change.

442
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:46,908
This is part of it.

443
01:05:47,008 --> 01:05:47,208
Yeah.

444
01:05:47,308 --> 01:05:57,708
The two things I would share is like give ourselves a Grace and feel like every idea doesn't work because that they're not going to work and it's like an experiment mindset, just be willing to try things.

445
01:05:58,008 --> 01:06:03,108
I didn't like, don't get to turn by if it doesn't work because they are hard problems.

446
01:06:03,108 --> 01:06:04,308
So like just keep that.

447
01:06:04,408 --> 01:06:06,608
Experimentation mindset and keep testing things.

448
01:06:07,308 --> 01:06:25,208
That's actually one of the paradoxes, we need a long-term mindset, we need Grace, but we also need a sense of urgency because the Mental Health crisis is real, and a lot of people are suffering, and so we need to address it.

449
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:27,008
That's why I am so grateful.

450
01:06:27,008 --> 01:06:44,008
You both signed the mental health pledge which was basically put together by Thrive and Society of Human Resources management to protect their mental health advances that we have made in the last two years at a time.

451
01:06:44,008 --> 01:06:53,708
When we know companies have to make tough decisions layoffs, hiring freezes and cats to protect cash.

452
01:06:53,708 --> 01:07:11,908
Let us not cut on Mental Health offerings because that's been one of the advances of the last two years and it's Now, more important than ever because the Mental Health crisis is being described as the second pandemic.

453
01:07:13,508 --> 01:07:18,908
I mean, with that, I think I want to bring that up, start kind of getting us to a close Ariana.

454
01:07:19,108 --> 01:07:23,608
I mean, what you're bringing to the conversation is so timely, so meaningful.

455
01:07:23,608 --> 01:07:26,308
So human is so anchoring as well, right?

456
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:28,908
It's like kind of shaking it off as I guess I have a meeting.

457
01:07:28,908 --> 01:07:29,708
Yes, I have a to do.

458
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:30,308
Yes, I do.

459
01:07:30,308 --> 01:07:31,208
I am always going to have a meeting.

460
01:07:31,208 --> 01:07:32,608
I am always going to have a to do.

461
01:07:32,908 --> 01:07:34,208
But that person that's waiting.

462
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:35,408
On the couch.

463
01:07:35,608 --> 01:07:37,808
But I am choosing to Beyond another meeting.

464
01:07:37,808 --> 01:07:39,608
Another call another slack.

465
01:07:39,608 --> 01:07:45,808
Another document that person is waiting for me to go have dinner and that's more precious than anything else.

466
01:07:45,808 --> 01:07:46,008
Right?

467
01:07:46,008 --> 01:07:53,908
And I think that as we're in this shift Ariana, I think what you said is really, really important, we have Technologies, we can figure things out.

468
01:07:53,908 --> 01:07:55,208
Technology will get better.

469
01:07:55,208 --> 01:08:04,308
We will solve a lot of these issues, but I think us as humans adapting to this new change and us take an ownership as well of our mental.

470
01:08:04,408 --> 01:08:11,408
Oh, health and us as employers taking ownership of it as well for our employees, is really where the magic is going to happen.

471
01:08:12,008 --> 01:08:18,108
I want to before we close out with a reset and Ariana would love for you to kind of introduce a reset.

472
01:08:18,108 --> 01:08:20,008
This is more like a collective reset.

473
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:24,608
And this is part of us is exiting from today with a little bit more peace with a little bit.

474
01:08:24,608 --> 01:08:27,908
More being grounded before we go back to our families.

475
01:08:28,008 --> 01:08:31,408
Am I do want to remind everybody that in a few weeks?

476
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:33,508
We're going to be hosting another event here on.

477
01:08:33,508 --> 01:08:34,108
Welcome.

478
01:08:34,508 --> 01:08:35,808
Even the conversation going on.

479
01:08:35,808 --> 01:08:37,207
Changing how we work.

480
01:08:37,308 --> 01:08:43,508
And just featuring, Tony Jamis is the co-founder and CEO of oyster, and Chris heard founder.

481
01:08:43,508 --> 01:08:44,908
And CEO of First Base.

482
01:08:44,908 --> 01:08:52,308
These guys are on the front end of remote, and building companies that support that and making that happen.

483
01:08:52,308 --> 01:08:54,608
So please join us there, Ariana.

484
01:08:54,608 --> 01:09:06,808
And Joe again, thank you for not just spending your time, but also the intention of your presence here with everyone on the, on the call and on the ENT Ariana reset.

485
01:09:06,808 --> 01:09:08,608
We have a reset here for all of us to do.

486
01:09:08,608 --> 01:09:09,707
Why don't you bring us home?

487
01:09:09,707 --> 01:09:12,508
Will play the reset and I will see you guys in The Green Room.

488
01:09:13,008 --> 01:09:17,008
Well, first of all, well Robert, I want to thank you so much for bringing us together.

489
01:09:17,008 --> 01:09:25,308
This has been a wonderful event and I would go anywhere to be in conversation with Joe so that made it doubly wonderful.

490
01:09:26,108 --> 01:09:34,008
And you said something beautiful about those a person waiting for us beyond the to-do list beyond the meeting.

491
01:09:34,408 --> 01:09:35,908
I also want to remind us.

492
01:09:35,908 --> 01:09:47,207
There is another person waiting for us and that somebody inside ourselves and sometimes we forget that and you know thick not hand, the Buddhist monk said something beautiful.

493
01:09:47,207 --> 01:09:51,207
He said it's never been easier to run away from ourselves.

494
01:09:51,707 --> 01:09:53,608
There are so many distractions.

495
01:09:54,408 --> 01:09:59,608
It's so difficult to find even 60 seconds to be with ourselves.

496
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:08,408
So that's another function of reset that we are going to play now and there are hundreds of them on the Thrive platform.

497
01:10:08,908 --> 01:10:23,908
Take this moment to really just stay fully present gratefully, as Maya Angelou said, with ourselves and reconnect with ourselves, which makes it much easier to reconnect with anyone else.

498
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:25,308
Thank you, everyone.

499
01:10:26,508 --> 01:10:26,908
Thank you.

500
01:10:33,308 --> 01:10:34,108
Breathing.

501
01:10:36,908 --> 01:10:38,108
Breathe out.

502
01:10:42,908 --> 01:10:45,908
Time moves quickly, especially when we are so busy.

503
01:10:47,808 --> 01:10:51,308
But At this moment let us pause and take it slow.

504
01:10:53,308 --> 01:10:56,508
Bring your attention to the rising and falling of your breath.

505
01:10:58,508 --> 01:10:59,908
Appreciate the slowness.

506
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:04,608
Notice how your body feels when you allow yourself.

507
01:11:04,608 --> 01:11:06,708
This moment of calm and quiet.

508
01:11:11,408 --> 01:11:12,508
Throughout your Day.

509
01:11:13,008 --> 01:11:15,308
Let Yourself observe the world around you.

510
01:11:16,808 --> 01:11:19,408
And remember that each moment is a gift.

511
01:11:22,508 --> 01:11:23,408
Breathe in.

512
01:11:27,808 --> 01:11:28,908
Breathe out.

1
00:20:05,715 --> 00:20:09,315
Hi everyone, welcome to today's event.

2
00:20:09,315 --> 00:20:25,215
We're so excited to have you here, and we're joined by an incredible panel of CEOs, bleeding distributed teams, and we're going to talk about the top trends and predictions for leading distributed teams in 2023.

3
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:29,315
So I am really excited about hearing what they have to say.

4
00:20:29,515 --> 00:20:32,615
Feel free to drop in chat where you're tuning in from.

5
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:42,715
I am in Vegas today, we have some Folks here from Puerto Rico, Ireland Mendocino, California Quarry in Orlando, Florida.

6
00:20:42,715 --> 00:20:46,415
It's great to have you all joining from all over the world.

7
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:51,615
This is really exciting, and we have got in Q&A that tab, right?

8
00:20:51,615 --> 00:21:00,615
That you see, right over there, feel free to drop any questions that you have any burning questions about Trends and predictions.

9
00:21:01,315 --> 00:21:04,015
Please throw them in there and upvote.

10
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:07,015
Any questions that really resonate to you.

11
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:11,615
All right, so about our topic today, you know, one thing is clear.

12
00:21:12,415 --> 00:21:18,515
Obviously, we are not the same people from 2020 to this collective experience.

13
00:21:18,515 --> 00:21:31,915
We have all had over the past few years has left truly a lasting imprint and it's completely redefining the role of work and balance and wellness in our lives today.

14
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:47,015
You know, according to ladders 25% of All professional jobs in North America, will be remote by the end of 2020 to and remote opportunities will continue to increase through 2023.

15
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:54,515
So today I am really excited about what we're going to talk about with our CEOs, as they're leading distribute.

16
00:21:54,515 --> 00:22:05,215
Team teams, we want to hear what they're seeing, what are the trends, the predictions they're picking up right now and into the next 12 months and 24 months.

17
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:10,015
It's, so we have got CEOs from scoop bucket list and welcome.

18
00:22:10,015 --> 00:22:12,215
They're designing tools for the future.

19
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,915
And before I bring them on, let us do a quick little poll.

20
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:19,615
So Katie who's our lovely producer in The Green Room?

21
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:20,115
Hello?

22
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:20,515
Hello.

23
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:21,815
Thank you for pulling that poll.

24
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:32,015
Which one of these do you think will be a top Trend in 2023, remote only work hybrid work in person?

25
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:38,915
Work mental health and well-being, access to Talent OR flying First which of these feel free to place your votes.

26
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:44,915
All right, we see mental health and well-being and hybrid work.

27
00:22:44,915 --> 00:22:45,715
Being top.

28
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:47,415
Top up there, okay?

29
00:22:47,515 --> 00:22:47,915
All right.

30
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:52,815
So with that, I would love to introduce our panelists to the stage.

31
00:22:52,815 --> 00:23:01,715
Please join me here, Rob Shadow, CEO, scoop, Jason Lindstrom, CEO of bucket list rewards and Roberto Ortiz.

32
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,615
CEO of welcome.

33
00:23:07,515 --> 00:23:08,715
Hi.

34
00:23:10,615 --> 00:23:17,315
Hey Dina it's going well, thank you for opening up and hosting the conversation looking forward to.

35
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:19,915
Absolutely, we are very excited about this.

36
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:20,515
Could eat.

37
00:23:20,715 --> 00:23:26,515
You introduce yourselves and maybe tell us a little bit about what you're building for our who distributed teams.

38
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:29,615
And I will start with you rob Roberto.

39
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:31,615
Got Two Brothers Rubber.

40
00:23:33,115 --> 00:23:37,015
And to be clear, we just coordinate this in the green room because we got to Rob's up here.

41
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,715
And I am doing by Roberto today buddy.

42
00:23:39,715 --> 00:23:40,715
Like Roberto CEO.

43
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:42,115
Co-founder of welcome.

44
00:23:42,415 --> 00:24:03,215
We, we built the technology that's being used for this event are Technologies, helps companies that are driving Table and remote employee experiences, and they're asking the question how to engage their employees and better ways how to communicate and better ways than the technology that we were used to prior to this.

45
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:04,915
And so welcome, fits that Gap.

46
00:24:04,915 --> 00:24:16,115
So we Empower connection of this remote Workforce, and we're happy, we're happy to just be serving sort of the shift and this future of work that we all find ourselves.

47
00:24:20,615 --> 00:24:25,215
Dr. Rob and thanks again for saving the name.

48
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:39,315
Rob's me for this conversation is much appreciated, so I am Rob I am the CEO and co-founder at scoop, we're big fans of hybrid work, you know, and believe pretty great deeply in the future is being hybrid and some capacity.

49
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:50,615
And one of the things that we started to find very early in the pandemic though, was that if hybrid work is fundamentally about choice and there are good reasons why you might want to.

50
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:53,315
To work from home or work in the office on a given day.

51
00:24:53,715 --> 00:25:01,515
Nothing really is worse than if you decide to go into the office, you find no one else has their, you spend the day on video conference and you say, well, this is kind of waste of time.

52
00:25:01,515 --> 00:25:02,315
Why do we do this?

53
00:25:02,315 --> 00:25:07,515
And so we built software that's built into slack and Google Calendar and chrome.

54
00:25:07,815 --> 00:25:20,315
That allows you to see flexibly who's working, where who's planning on working, where updated status and calendar, it will pass slack updating slack, it will pass to other platforms, make it the hybrid work is a little bit easier to operate.

55
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:28,315
You can actually unlock that flexibility and when you go to the office, always feels worth it, so appreciate being invited and excited to do this.

56
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:31,115
Thanks, Rob.

57
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:33,215
Jason, awesome.

58
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:34,815
My name is Jason Lindstrom.

59
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:36,315
Lovely to meet everybody.

60
00:25:36,315 --> 00:26:09,315
Virtually, I am the CEO of over at Buck of the street wards where we are a rewards and recognition platform and like fundamentally when you take great care of your staff, they perform better, and they stick around longer and Pockets rewards is all about, you know, recognizing both the micro moments and the big achievements of your staff which helps reduce turnover by as much as 80% in precreasing Coke, Employee Engagement by 25%, and I am just personally am very deeply interested in building, high-performing cultures.

61
00:26:09,315 --> 00:26:12,315
And we're on a mission to help build the best cultures in the world.

62
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:22,015
And so today's topic is super relevant, I am happy to share any sort of tips tricks or insights into the future because like we're Berto and Rob.

63
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:29,715
I am sure I have had a chance to work with hundreds of clients and see how people are doing things today, and how some people are doing things in a very Progressive Way for the Future.

64
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:32,215
So looking forward to sharing any insights.

65
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,415
I might have Thanked you all.

66
00:26:35,715 --> 00:26:47,015
We're very excited to hear you those tips and tricks, for sure, we have got five different categories that we wanted to cover and, you know, we will see what we can get through.

67
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:53,715
Because I am seeing the questions begin to pop up in the Q&A panel, but one is flexibility and quality of life.

68
00:26:53,715 --> 00:26:57,415
The second is employee management communication Wellness.

69
00:26:58,115 --> 00:27:02,615
Going fully remote versus in person hybrid and creating a better workplace.

70
00:27:03,015 --> 00:27:05,415
And I know each of you have touched that.

71
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:11,415
So the first trend is around flexibility and quality of life.

72
00:27:11,815 --> 00:27:14,615
Now, we see these stats, here's one stat from future.

73
00:27:14,615 --> 00:27:33,315
Forums pulse, survey reports that knowledge workers who say they have little to no ability to set their own hours, are 2.6 more likely to definitely look for a new job 2.2%, you know, times worse, it works in.

74
00:27:33,515 --> 00:27:40,115
Related Stress and Anxiety and 1.7 times worse in work-life Balance, 1.4 times the worst pronounce.

75
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:41,215
We're seeing that.

76
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:46,015
A lot of knowledge workers are wanting flexibility.

77
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:52,115
What are you seeing as the pros and cons around flexible work?

78
00:27:54,315 --> 00:27:56,315
I will kick off on my side.

79
00:27:56,915 --> 00:28:00,315
Is that Rob, I have robbed all pass it over to the.

80
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:04,715
I have passed it over to you, but just taking a step back.

81
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:19,915
I think that, you know, we're here we're talking about sort of the trends were talking about the future, but I think it's pretty clear to say that what we have all experienced is just shift in remote and flex.

82
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:23,515
Becoming a first class citizen in how we work.

83
00:28:24,115 --> 00:28:30,315
I no longer our leaders and employees thinking about it the same way they were thinking about it 23 years ago.

84
00:28:30,615 --> 00:28:41,315
And so it's pretty safe to say that, you know, a new way of working is becoming a permanent fixture in the boardrooms and meetings and how we actually look at work.

85
00:28:41,815 --> 00:28:46,615
And I think that also something to take into consideration that I won't think is discussed.

86
00:28:46,615 --> 00:29:09,915
As is often like how folks are prioritizing work given the 23 years that we have gone through, folks, understanding, and getting a taste of flexibility, what has that done to the way, they look at work, the way that they look at Travel, the way that they look at what was to, what could be.

87
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:23,615
I think, is a really, really interesting sort of like foundational piece to the conversation here because you know, I think that there's a lot of pros and cons and anything you look at, you can always make a pros and cons list.

88
00:29:24,015 --> 00:29:29,315
On anything, you can, we can make a pros and cons list, making a family trip to Disney World.

89
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:36,315
There's always going to be a pros and cons list but I think at a very high level Gina and Rob I will hand it over to you.

90
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:46,415
I think that you know there's a lot of Pros that comes with this more flexible way of looking at work both to employee choice.

91
00:29:46,415 --> 00:30:07,115
Not just from the employee side choosing where to live but also the employer choosing to employ people from I am around the world and looking at a diverse set of talent from around the world and saying, yes, we can equip you now and bring you into this organization because we have been forced to change the way we work.

92
00:30:07,115 --> 00:30:09,915
We have been forced to restructure the way we meet.

93
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:22,815
We have been forced to rethink the way that we operate from the ground up because the best companies are doing that work and have already done that work to change the way they work, so they can support this new future.

94
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:25,615
And so A lot of Pros that comes on that side.

95
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:44,115
I think the cons comes and now and I say cons lightly because I think that cons is really the level of intention necessary to operate a successful organization today versus two years ago and it can be looked as a con because it looks like more work.

96
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:52,315
But this is the fast track way to be a more future-oriented Workforce and Company is to do the intentional work.

97
00:30:52,315 --> 00:31:07,615
Now to figure out how to drive an equitable experience for people that are in the office versus not to do the work on, making sure that you have the right technology in place to know when to go to the office, we're obviously to the technology that you're building.

98
00:31:07,815 --> 00:31:08,015
All right.

99
00:31:08,015 --> 00:31:16,615
It's doing the intentional work to have the time to meet to figure out the policies to look at the tools to invest in whether that's training or technology.

100
00:31:17,115 --> 00:31:22,115
So it feels like calm because there's a lot more work to it because people are resistant to change.

101
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:26,015
But the beauty about is if we lean into We're all in a better place, right?

102
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:29,415
Our employees are in a better place, our organization and the bottom line.

103
00:31:29,715 --> 00:31:33,415
And so that's how I think about the pros and cons my side.

104
00:31:37,015 --> 00:32:01,815
I will add a couple of thoughts and I agree, I think a lot of the framing around the intentionality resonates with me personally and maybe in terms of framing some of the benefits and then I will get into some of the cons, but I will kind of split the way I think about this, at least into two pieces, maybe one that's more macro and one that's kind of like more micro to the individual, you know, and in a macro context and it's pretty wild.

105
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:03,615
They want two things that fascinates me about it.

106
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:16,215
The concept of flexible work and hybrid remote work is Yeah, by end of this year, something like a billion people globally are going to be working in some kind of hybrid or flexible remote type of capacity.

107
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:21,615
It is arguably the biggest change that our generation will experience, right?

108
00:32:21,615 --> 00:32:24,515
Then it comes to like the concept of work and what it means to work.

109
00:32:24,515 --> 00:32:36,415
And one of the huge benefits I see in that is ability to enable talent and local markets to have access to more jobs and as a result, build local economies, right?

110
00:32:36,615 --> 00:32:39,615
Like for a lot of us work in tech, for example.

111
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:45,115
And one of the things that used to be true in Tech is that certain metros our cities kind of hoovered up Tech Talent, right?

112
00:32:45,115 --> 00:32:49,715
If you wanted to go work in technical would hike out to the Bay Area or two other locations.

113
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:58,515
And the idea that folks can be much more distributed now work in different locations, have local offices that they could go into and still join companies.

114
00:32:58,515 --> 00:33:02,715
That may be headquartered halfway across the world as extremely powerful, right?

115
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:04,315
And it keeps local talent local.

116
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,515
It has a lot of impact on local economies in the world.

117
00:33:06,615 --> 00:33:08,415
Those ecosystems get built over time.

118
00:33:08,615 --> 00:33:13,215
So in a macro sense I think that's incredibly valuable on a more micro level.

119
00:33:13,215 --> 00:33:22,015
It kind of the individual level there's a lot of things that I think we learned or beneficial about flexibility over the experience the last few years, right?

120
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:31,715
And whether that's days that you want to work from home because of a personal commitment or an errand or something else going on, I personally attitude.

121
00:33:31,715 --> 00:33:36,515
Maybe that just a little insight to my life solve this really viscerally firsthand.

122
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:40,515
Because I have a daughter who will be one on actually tomorrow.

123
00:33:41,115 --> 00:33:51,515
And so she was born during the pandemic and I saw the experience for my wife, you know, working and having that flexibility to work from home and how impactful that was for her when daughter was really, really young.

124
00:33:51,515 --> 00:34:00,915
And so they're real benefits that come with being able to have that flexibility and work from home at the same time, like there's connection that comes from being around others.

125
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:11,215
And there are certain activities, you know whether it be grabbing lunch or grabbing coffee or brainstorming something, Snow White boarding where there will always be some value being able to get folks together.

126
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:17,315
And the idea that you have the flexibility to potentially pick and choose, you know, on what day is certain things work best for you.

127
00:34:17,415 --> 00:34:18,915
I think is incredibly powerful.

128
00:34:18,915 --> 00:34:39,415
It's one of the Silver, Linings of the pandemic, experience, on the flip side, you know, from a Content perspective, I think what Roberto said is pretty accurate, you know where it requires an increased level of intentionality, you know, in terms of, where do I spend my time and being thoughtful about that in advance, whereAs you know, before, maybe most folks have the default.

129
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:46,614
Okay, well, I know I am going to be in the office and so you get the car or get the subway, I go back and forth now, it's okay.

130
00:34:46,614 --> 00:34:49,014
Well, is it a good decision to go into the office?

131
00:34:49,014 --> 00:34:51,715
Who else is going to be in the office about that's type of software?

132
00:34:51,715 --> 00:35:06,415
Obviously, it's scoop that we build is to try and reduce that decision pain, make it as easy as possible, so you can unlock those benefits, but I do think that there's an increase in intentionality and one of the things we will talk about a little bit as an increased need to be thoughtful around boundaries and how do you enable people?

133
00:35:06,615 --> 00:35:12,515
Be able to set their own schedule and be thoughtful around that in the right way so that you can work flexibly but not have a takeover.

134
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:14,515
Hmm.

135
00:35:15,815 --> 00:35:37,415
That's awesome context, Rob I like how you framed it most in the micro and the macro I might share my brief take on this as well and I will start just from the first person and then maybe expand, but I love that, you talked about being able to be there for your daughter's birthday, in my experience, in this whole remote work experience by working from home.

136
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:38,615
I am exercising, more.

137
00:35:38,615 --> 00:35:40,115
I am back to my university.

138
00:35:40,115 --> 00:35:43,415
Wait again, I am spending way more time with my family.

139
00:35:44,415 --> 00:35:50,315
I have got a We're all going to six year old and I think the quality time relationship I am building with them is fantastic.

140
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:57,115
So personally I deeply passionate about remote work but then going more to the macro and framing the big picture.

141
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:57,715
That's it.

142
00:35:57,715 --> 00:36:11,115
I think there's like really important context, for example, some Industries like healthcare Hospitality going to remotes can be far more challenging and the barriers of the pros and cons list might be a little bit different from say Tech space.

143
00:36:12,515 --> 00:36:18,815
But even looking at organizations that are naturally conducive to going to remote hybrid type of environment.

144
00:36:19,215 --> 00:36:24,515
I think there's some real important fundamentals that almost hit below the remote conversation.

145
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:32,015
For example, I read recently that seven percent of people do feel a sense of meaning and purpose from work.

146
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:40,715
Meaning they're looking to their job to help deal meaning in their life, so they can see more important than ever for companies to have really meaningful Mission Vision and values.

147
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:45,215
And then once you have a great Mission Vision and value, I also think it's deep.

148
00:36:45,415 --> 00:36:47,515
You can call to get people in their zones, genius.

149
00:36:47,515 --> 00:37:03,015
These are the things that we love to do, and they're also really, really good at and I think if you anchor from there, the remote conversation becomes a lot more easy because you're getting people to do the things that I love to do in a meaningful organization that has a big impact in the world and than Super tactically.

150
00:37:03,215 --> 00:37:08,015
Any time, I attend a session like this, I am always looking for cool ideas on how to build a really great experience.

151
00:37:08,015 --> 00:37:15,115
Remote experience we say quality of life experience in some kind of fun thing that we do internally that I think there's a lot of meaning.

152
00:37:15,315 --> 00:37:16,115
For employees.

153
00:37:16,115 --> 00:37:20,415
As we have, we have this program that helps employees achieve life goals.

154
00:37:20,415 --> 00:37:25,515
So basically, everybody gets some money and a day off to knock something off, their, their life, to do list.

155
00:37:25,715 --> 00:37:35,415
We happen to get $500 and one day off per year, and I have seen people do everything from taking flight lessons to go into an NFL football game with their son.

156
00:37:36,015 --> 00:37:37,415
There's one girl named Julie.

157
00:37:37,415 --> 00:37:40,015
She never taken her husband to go whale watching.

158
00:37:40,715 --> 00:37:44,615
I asked her how it went afterwards, and she said it was one of the most meaningful experiences in our life.

159
00:37:44,615 --> 00:37:51,215
So I think moving in Mission Vision and values getting people into the zones of genius and helping them achieve whatever matters.

160
00:37:51,215 --> 00:37:59,015
Most in life are great Baseline to build a whole remote conversation offer Wow, that's powerful.

161
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:11,215
I think as a mom of three I totally relate to you and parenting and the joys that remote flexibility offers in getting that closeness and each of you our fathers.

162
00:38:12,115 --> 00:38:15,415
And so, that's, that's pretty awesome to hear.

163
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:17,415
Thank you for answering that.

164
00:38:17,415 --> 00:38:26,115
Now, we have got a question Q&A that actually relates to this Katie, if you don't mind pulling that on stage, how are you managing flexibility?

165
00:38:26,115 --> 00:38:27,115
For your company?

166
00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:34,015
Unseen both productivity and wellness so employees don't experience burnout.

167
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:41,515
It's kind of goes to boundaries, I think rob you mentioned that.

168
00:38:43,715 --> 00:38:45,315
Yeah, I am happy to I will kick off.

169
00:38:45,315 --> 00:38:47,415
I will just share, just we can cover more ground.

170
00:38:47,415 --> 00:38:49,615
I will just cover one example of something that we're doing that.

171
00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:51,415
We found impactful and then pass them along.

172
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:58,315
But one of the things that we learned over the last couple of years and you know, Roberto and incur.

173
00:38:58,315 --> 00:39:07,815
I am curious if everybody else has ever experienced this Jason you to like, is when we would do time off and everybody kind of plan their own time off?

174
00:39:07,815 --> 00:39:13,315
Sometimes when you're on PTO, it's a little bit challenging because the rest of the business is continuing to move.

175
00:39:13,515 --> 00:39:13,915
Long.

176
00:39:13,915 --> 00:39:28,915
And so you go on PTO and either you feel like you got do a bunch of work to kind of prep for it on the front end or you come back and you get this Avalanche of stuff that you missed, and it kind of creates a little bit of stress or fraying on the ends that make that dto slightly less valuable in some ways.

177
00:39:28,915 --> 00:39:34,015
And so, one thing that we start doing it just for company-wide time off, any consistent basis.

178
00:39:34,015 --> 00:39:43,115
And so a couple examples we did in that is like we did hold the whole week in July 4th off for the company, we do whole week between Christmas and New Year's off.

179
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:46,815
Have picked a few other kind of like long weekends, over the course of the year.

180
00:39:46,815 --> 00:40:03,715
And basically tried to have the entire company be off at similar times and found that like, when everybody's work stops, it means the likelihood of you getting pinged with something else while you're out and not being able to protect that time goes down and the relative pick up on the other side of it, you know, isn't quite as bad.

181
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:06,715
People obviously still do, I am going to PTO.

182
00:40:06,715 --> 00:40:18,015
So folks take their own vacation, obviously, at times if they want you outside of it, but at least having those couple moments of course, and they I have found to be, you know, pretty good refresher for folks in terms of trying to find some balance.

183
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:20,115
Yeah no doubt.

184
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:22,715
So Rob I will piggyback off of that.

185
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:24,915
We also do very similar, right?

186
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:27,515
We just did the week of summer break.

187
00:40:27,515 --> 00:40:28,215
We called it.

188
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:28,515
Alright?

189
00:40:28,515 --> 00:40:29,115
In July.

190
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:38,215
So we can just kind of check out super helpful to make sure that everybody's off and there's not like the feeling of being left behind or trying to catch up on emails.

191
00:40:38,715 --> 00:40:45,915
One thing we also introduced is Wellness Fridays and with that means it's it really becomes just a wellness weekend.

192
00:40:46,415 --> 00:40:51,015
A weekend, Focus On Wellness happens once Of the first Friday of every month.

193
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:54,315
We tell people, to log off and just go, B.

194
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:55,915
Go B, go do whatever it is.

195
00:40:55,915 --> 00:40:56,315
You want to do.

196
00:40:56,315 --> 00:40:57,315
You want to sleep in that day?

197
00:40:57,315 --> 00:40:59,715
You want to go on a quick weekend trip.

198
00:40:59,715 --> 00:41:07,515
Please go do that, and we kick that off this year, and it's been I think game-changing, not just for employees, before leaders, as well.

199
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:13,015
For Founders, for us, is actually unplugged and lead, by example, and say, you know what?

200
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:15,415
Like, I am actually going to go ahead and unplug.

201
00:41:15,415 --> 00:41:19,015
I am a Google, go do this, and this is something that I am personally working on.

202
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:21,115
Jason, I love to hear your back to your college.

203
00:41:21,115 --> 00:41:22,415
Wait that's inspiration.

204
00:41:22,415 --> 00:41:23,315
I got to get back out there.

205
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:24,315
Go for a run as well.

206
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,315
But what are the things for me personally has been?

207
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:32,615
How do I make sure that if I want my employees to be well, how does it start with me?

208
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,915
How do I be well?

209
00:41:34,015 --> 00:41:45,615
So, when I show up into a call so that when I show up on a 10-1, I am not carrying the weight of all the things of lack of boundaries and so, all my calendar.

210
00:41:45,615 --> 00:41:48,915
I legit have family time blocked off my entire team.

211
00:41:49,215 --> 00:42:04,315
Is this and I marked it in the golden color on my calendar because like, those golden hours is like, regardless of what time zone, you're on, like this is my time when I am going to be reading to my kid or having dinner with my family, that's like a no-go signal.

212
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:08,015
And I think there's such a mean going back to intention.

213
00:42:08,315 --> 00:42:09,915
It's not just the employer intention.

214
00:42:09,915 --> 00:42:28,115
This is why it's difficult, it's not just the employer in such an also the employee intention because as an employer you're saying, look, I want to hire people, that work around the world and I expect that you also can put the right boundaries around your work, and I want to empower you to do so.

215
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:37,515
And so it's a two-way thing where it's like, you control your calendar, you can jump off of a meeting if there's a meeting scheduled, that's not an alignment.

216
00:42:37,915 --> 00:42:44,515
If the culture set up properly and properly accepting of remote and probably accepting of flexibility.

217
00:42:45,115 --> 00:42:50,515
Then the magic there is empowering every individual to take Control of their time.

218
00:42:50,815 --> 00:42:54,115
If you want to go for that run, then go for that run.

219
00:42:54,415 --> 00:43:05,415
If it's important for you to pick up your daughter at 3:00, you know, East Coast time, every single day, you can do that because the school is 10 minutes away before you had to work an hour away.

220
00:43:05,615 --> 00:43:11,715
But now you have the ability to jump into car or go for a walk, pick up your kid, come back, that's the beauty of remote.

221
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:15,715
And if we don't allow that to happen, then why are we working remotely?

222
00:43:15,715 --> 00:43:16,915
Why are we even flexible?

223
00:43:17,015 --> 00:43:18,015
If we're not going to do that.

224
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:26,415
So I think this really Important thing around, intentionality coming from the employer but also from the employee to feel empowered to take control of their time.

225
00:43:29,915 --> 00:43:31,415
Yeah, I get awesome.

226
00:43:31,415 --> 00:43:51,215
I think I am just gonna provide a short summary because we do some similar takes as to some of the items you mentioned Roberto and Rob it where we first started really struggling with work-life balance, is an organization, is when you became a truly distributed company, where we started having employees in different countries around the world.

227
00:43:51,215 --> 00:44:20,015
And we're trying to manage multiple time zones, and so we built a full like Playbook policy on distributed work and one of the best Takeaways, I think because we have just a four-hour overlap, where we expect everybody to be available and freely like kind of on when it comes to like slack or instant messaging email excetera then outside of those hours, people can set their own boundaries in terms of like, you know, family time in terms of like health and wellness and then in terms of the health and wellness, peace, we don't do it, do it once per month.

228
00:44:20,015 --> 00:44:21,215
So that's a really cool idea.

229
00:44:21,215 --> 00:44:29,215
The Friday off every month, we have a health and wellness day once per quarter for all staff and that's similar to your take Right?

230
00:44:29,215 --> 00:44:32,515
So we have had some awesome feedback, people love it and it's we don't question.

231
00:44:32,515 --> 00:44:33,915
It doesn't require approval.

232
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:38,615
It's more of a notification than taking a certain day off to ya to take care of my health and wellness.

233
00:44:39,815 --> 00:44:47,515
And then, lastly, I think one of the best ways for managing distributed teams or remote teams, is getting more focused on outcomes.

234
00:44:47,515 --> 00:44:48,315
Not inputs.

235
00:44:48,615 --> 00:44:56,315
So rather than grinding out a really, really heavy day setting some really clear like kpis or success metrics for each staff member.

236
00:44:57,315 --> 00:45:05,615
And for example, we have these things called Scorecards that we used to create like job descriptions that we use in our weekly, 12 ones and performance reviews as well.

237
00:45:05,915 --> 00:45:11,015
But it's typically three to five outcomes, we expect from every single role to create alignment across the organization.

238
00:45:11,815 --> 00:45:17,015
And that's created a lot of clarity because the sales is always the easiest one because it's so metric driven.

239
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:23,115
But like, if you're crushing your sales Target, I don't really, and you're a good culture fit and a good human being.

240
00:45:23,815 --> 00:45:27,615
I don't, you know, I don't really care whether you work in 12 hours or six hours.

241
00:45:27,615 --> 00:45:28,915
It's about like hitting those out.

242
00:45:29,015 --> 00:45:29,515
It comes.

243
00:45:29,515 --> 00:45:35,615
So that's kind of been our take on managing distributed work and the work-life balance.

244
00:45:37,915 --> 00:45:38,215
Thank you.

245
00:45:38,215 --> 00:45:46,615
That Jason that's actually a perfect layup into our next trending category of employee management and communication for distributed teams.

246
00:45:47,015 --> 00:45:55,415
So you know as we're all talking about here managing distributed teams, it's evolving the way we communicate.

247
00:45:55,415 --> 00:45:56,515
The way we lead.

248
00:45:57,715 --> 00:45:58,815
What are the challenges?

249
00:45:58,815 --> 00:46:01,015
You're Currently encountering with that.

250
00:46:01,515 --> 00:46:03,715
How do you see into the future?

251
00:46:04,015 --> 00:46:16,215
This will evolve there was a quote from Stewart Butterfield slack where he was saying, we're barely skimming the surface of understanding the tools needed to effectively manage remote.

252
00:46:16,415 --> 00:46:22,615
So what are the challenges that you're encountering, where things are seeing today and what do you see into the future?

253
00:46:30,015 --> 00:46:32,715
Anybody going to jump into that one?

254
00:46:34,115 --> 00:46:35,115
I will kick it off.

255
00:46:35,115 --> 00:46:43,815
I will kick it off on my side, so I think you know Stuart from slack he's completely right on when you know when he talks about this all the time.

256
00:46:44,315 --> 00:46:45,515
All of us use slack.

257
00:46:45,515 --> 00:46:59,315
We feel like slack is the thing that connects us remotely in many, many ways and even yet you know, the person leading that's a technology in that company says we were just scratching the surface on the Technologies needed to do this really well.

258
00:46:59,815 --> 00:47:00,515
And I think that's true.

259
00:47:00,515 --> 00:47:15,515
I think that we have taking the tools that have existed already and have made them, so if the pillars of how we use technology to connect, but there's a ton of new technology that has to be built for these specific use cases.

260
00:47:15,815 --> 00:47:29,915
We are just embarking a lot of different challenges and I think as technologists as folks that build as folks that create our job, is to figure out how to improve those problems that we interact with our showing up into the Office.

261
00:47:29,915 --> 00:47:34,115
If I took a one-hour commute and my team is in there or is only two people in the office.

262
00:47:34,115 --> 00:47:41,215
That's a problem because I feel like I made this effort and showed up and it wasn't there or posting a company.

263
00:47:41,215 --> 00:47:43,215
All hands and saying, you know what?

264
00:47:43,215 --> 00:47:49,315
Like we're doing it on Zoom or Google me and it doesn't feel engaging, I don't feel the music, I don't feel the presence.

265
00:47:49,315 --> 00:47:56,315
I don't feel the energy that I want to feel that requires a new way of thinking and using technology to better, engage your employees.

266
00:47:56,615 --> 00:48:02,915
And how do you actually track engagement and reward your Police through the entire Journey?

267
00:48:03,115 --> 00:48:03,915
What does that look like?

268
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:12,315
Well, there's new technology that needs to be built, so I think like when we're looking at the Space is really about, you know, what is status quo?

269
00:48:12,315 --> 00:48:13,815
And the status quo, good enough.

270
00:48:13,915 --> 00:48:22,615
And I think all those who say no, like we're never satisfied with status quo, there's always a better way of doing it and you look at that employee communication employee management.

271
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:29,515
I think there's one side of it was technology base, but a lot of it is just, you know, conversation, we just had around policy.

272
00:48:29,715 --> 00:48:37,415
See around intentionality around investing in Middle managers because they're carrying a lot of weight on how to lead.

273
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:45,415
Well, you know, I think so many folks have become managers and this new world that they're just understanding.

274
00:48:45,415 --> 00:48:46,615
Like this is how we work.

275
00:48:46,815 --> 00:48:59,615
Now, if there was a different manager that never managed ever distribute the team before, and they always relied on seeing them in the office and engaging their body language and seeing them sort of walk in the door at 8:00 AM and walk out.

276
00:48:59,715 --> 00:49:03,315
At 5 PM and sort of that's how they measure success.

277
00:49:03,915 --> 00:49:07,415
Even have a hard time if they don't change the way that they work.

278
00:49:07,415 --> 00:49:12,715
And I think so equip Ting middle managers is important and will keep seeing.

279
00:49:12,715 --> 00:49:13,915
I mean, we're talking about the future here.

280
00:49:13,915 --> 00:49:20,115
We will keep seeing how technology evolves to solve the problems that we're all feeling, but it's a fun, it's a fun.

281
00:49:20,315 --> 00:49:21,515
It's a fun place to be.

282
00:49:21,515 --> 00:49:27,215
I think a lot of times we get it, we get on these conversations and it's it feels like heavy and it feels.

283
00:49:27,415 --> 00:49:31,315
But I am so excited to of the future of like the future of work.

284
00:49:31,315 --> 00:49:33,015
I get to see my kids grow up.

285
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:34,515
I don't need to be in traffic.

286
00:49:34,515 --> 00:49:38,415
I can listen to Joe Rogan if I wanted to, when I go for a run worth is like in the car.

287
00:49:38,615 --> 00:49:43,315
There're other ways to get to your pocket as there're other ways to engage in work.

288
00:49:43,315 --> 00:49:45,015
And that's, that's what we're doing.

289
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:51,715
Anyway, I will shut up now because I can I get on my soapbox and just keep talking here but Gina hold me back.

290
00:49:52,715 --> 00:49:53,615
We love it.

291
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:56,215
How about you Robert Jason?

292
00:49:56,815 --> 00:49:57,515
Any thoughts?

293
00:49:57,815 --> 00:50:03,415
Yeah, I can maybe lend a mini experience sharing in a now on this.

294
00:50:03,415 --> 00:50:07,915
I have the deep personal passion and like, understanding like, what is the most simple?

295
00:50:07,915 --> 00:50:12,315
Most elegant system and process to create alignment and motivation inside of team.

296
00:50:12,515 --> 00:50:13,115
And what?

297
00:50:13,115 --> 00:50:15,415
That's a preface, but by no means am.

298
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:17,315
I what I am about to share the answer.

299
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:18,215
It's just one answer.

300
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:21,315
We found, so I don't to be prescriptive and saying, what we're doing is the best way.

301
00:50:21,815 --> 00:50:28,215
But for example, I think when it comes, Bringing people together getting them aligned and excited and motivated again.

302
00:50:28,215 --> 00:50:34,415
It, it's what I was mentioning earlier about having a really compelling Vision to share just a few details of what we do and there's salt.

303
00:50:34,415 --> 00:50:38,715
There's lots of resources on this topic, we have something called a Nutter traditional Vision.

304
00:50:38,715 --> 00:50:40,715
We have a three-year vision is called a painted picture.

305
00:50:41,015 --> 00:50:46,015
If you Google handed pitcher or Vivid Vision, there're all sorts of cool resources on how to create your own Vivid Vision.

306
00:50:46,215 --> 00:50:52,715
But it's like a forward-looking statement of what you envision the company to look like in the future and it's very descriptive, very colorful.

307
00:50:53,215 --> 00:51:12,215
And what we do to really bring Get to Life as we send it to every single new job applicant who comes to the organization to get given a sense, or a taste, as to what we're all about, to get them excited and then to celebrate the journey, because I think one thing we as entrepreneurs sometimes use, we don't celebrate the journey enough, won't celebrate those big wings and Milestones or this is what been one of my failings in the past.

308
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:18,115
So every quarter, we bring up our vision, and we celebrate the wins, and we do it via storytelling.

309
00:51:18,115 --> 00:51:20,315
So we will highlight individual employees.

310
00:51:20,815 --> 00:51:30,015
We anchor and how that person's contributions helped us achieve one of Our goals are rocks, from this longer-term vision and then from the vision, everything else falls out from there.

311
00:51:30,015 --> 00:51:46,315
So we do your legal setting using okay, our framework we do quarterly goal-setting again with okrs we do weekly management meetings using something called that an l 10 frameworks, which is like a really well-defined super-tight meeting to make sure people are aligned motivated and removing rocks and barriers that come up.

312
00:51:46,415 --> 00:51:51,215
So I think one of my favorite books and all that is, there's one called traction.

313
00:51:51,215 --> 00:51:54,715
Another one called cos the entrepreneurial operating Mmm.

314
00:51:55,015 --> 00:52:05,915
And so there's lots of good tools and systems that enable, I think a high-performing organization, but a specifically these tools in my experience are really impactful in the remote or distributed workplace.

315
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:07,415
Yeah.

316
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:11,715
Anyways, those are kind of my to limit my favorite tools and tips.

317
00:52:12,015 --> 00:52:16,915
But alas, what were the to the entrepreneurial operating system?

318
00:52:17,015 --> 00:52:20,715
There's a book called traction, which talks a lot about that and then, okay.

319
00:52:20,715 --> 00:52:27,715
Ours, for example, I am sure many, many of us are familiar, familiar those Whether you call them, okay, ours, rocks or Boulders, lots of tools.

320
00:52:27,715 --> 00:52:32,915
And then the final one is called a painted picture or Vivid Vision, just give it a Google.

321
00:52:32,915 --> 00:52:41,415
There's an author out there and in Cameron Harold, who's built, you know, taking companies from a million to 100 million in three years using the kind of vision framework.

322
00:52:42,115 --> 00:52:47,215
And as an entrepreneur in a company's actually really fun putting one together because there are quite colorful and playful.

323
00:52:49,915 --> 00:52:51,115
Thank you, that's great.

324
00:52:51,415 --> 00:53:04,815
How about you rob that I think first of all a bunch of really great tips from Jason and from Roberto on this, I will just add a little bit which is, you know, I think we naturally quite often.

325
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:13,015
I think we spent a lot of time talking about some of like the hardware stuff that's required and I don't mean how hard we're just in terms of wine, you know, like the kind of like physical assets or Machinery.

326
00:53:13,015 --> 00:53:18,815
I mean, in terms of like also like how do you put in place the Right video conferencing technology right?

327
00:53:18,815 --> 00:53:20,915
Or kind of operating Stems are things like that.

328
00:53:21,015 --> 00:53:29,415
The choice that we built, for example, but I think half of that also is like around the, the software so to speak of like, how do you get this stuff right?

329
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:44,415
And, and, and the way that I would describe it is, you know if I had to guess prior to the pandemic, maybe 1 in every 1,000 to 10,000 managers and ever managed hybrid tea before, like, you know if you were to look at scale across that, right?

330
00:53:44,415 --> 00:53:55,715
Like in so relative Collective knowledge and best practices and what that even means was like relatively minimal and Roberto is starting to like allude to this a little bit and talking about like, how do you think about management?

331
00:53:55,715 --> 00:54:00,515
But collectively managers have to get better in this world?

332
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:05,415
They have to be better managers like, on average than they were in a world where everybody's in the office every day.

333
00:54:05,815 --> 00:54:23,915
If everyone in the office every day, you can use generally crappy signals to figure out whether people are kind of like, you know, executing against their job clocking in and clocking out, you can look over them right, in a world where folks are hybrid, or But you have to be better, which means that you have to be more thoughtful around, what's the output?

334
00:54:23,915 --> 00:54:27,515
We're trying to drive how to folks in the team contribute to that.

335
00:54:27,615 --> 00:54:31,615
How do I find the right balance and checking in personally and professionally and supporting?

336
00:54:32,115 --> 00:54:47,015
And, so I think it, one of the things that I spend a lot of time thinking about is, like, not only how do you, I kind of coach and train on this topic with managers and here, we do our monthly manager discussions to understand what stuff of mine team and cover other topics around performance or compensation and things like that over time.

337
00:54:47,915 --> 00:54:50,515
But also like, how do you think About as a manager?

338
00:54:50,515 --> 00:54:54,515
Like what are the tips and tricks you start to arm them with to get better at this stuff, right?

339
00:54:54,515 --> 00:54:58,715
Like, can I give them better kind of customized training to having one on ones?

340
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:01,415
But folks who are they don't see very often?

341
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:05,015
Can we start to bring data over time?

342
00:55:05,015 --> 00:55:07,115
And in one of the things I think that we're very excited about it.

343
00:55:07,115 --> 00:55:13,615
Scoop is if I can marry overtime data around, how often folks are in the office, right?

344
00:55:13,915 --> 00:55:18,415
With kind of like how we do in terms of recognition, are we only promoting folks?

345
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:28,615
For example, that we see, Often, because we haven't learned how to be good at recognizing folks that we don't see as often as, and you can turn that into training opportunities and coaching for managers.

346
00:55:28,615 --> 00:55:30,615
Like, I think that stuff becomes really powerful.

347
00:55:30,615 --> 00:55:34,015
And so in addition to the hardware stuff I think is really, really important.

348
00:55:34,015 --> 00:55:47,415
I think there's this element of commitment as Executives and is companies to helping our people leaders get better in this world and manage to outcomes effectively, which just could take time and practice and best practice.

349
00:55:47,415 --> 00:55:49,515
Distillation, they come with lots.

350
00:55:49,615 --> 00:55:53,415
Lots and lots of organizations and teams practicing this, you know, and learning from each other.

351
00:55:55,415 --> 00:55:56,315
That's right on.

352
00:55:56,715 --> 00:56:03,415
I think that soft skill side of things is definitely something the hardware and the software, I like that a lot.

353
00:56:03,915 --> 00:56:05,815
It's definitely something that we're all learning.

354
00:56:05,915 --> 00:56:08,715
As we're figuring this management out.

355
00:56:08,715 --> 00:56:11,515
We have a question, we're actually getting a ton of questions in queue.

356
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:13,115
A thank you everybody for dropping them in.

357
00:56:13,115 --> 00:56:14,415
They're going to try to cover these.

358
00:56:15,115 --> 00:56:16,515
So what's relevant to?

359
00:56:16,515 --> 00:56:17,615
What we're talking about.

360
00:56:17,615 --> 00:56:21,015
Beat you carry on, here's an up, bow to question.

361
00:56:21,315 --> 00:56:21,615
Katie.

362
00:56:21,615 --> 00:56:39,015
If you don't mind pulling on a stage, how the roles for managers Eve all of in the distributed World from what they focused on in physical offices, Yeah, I think we sort of covered a little bit of this in the conversation around outcomes being more outcome is driven than anything else.

363
00:56:39,015 --> 00:56:52,315
The signals that Rob talks about these poor signals of like you know, presence being a measurement or how you know, sort of like extroverted you are how loud you are.

364
00:56:52,315 --> 00:56:55,615
Whatever it is no longer a signal, all right.

365
00:56:55,615 --> 00:57:04,515
I think it's more intention around having managers that understand the importance of that check-in, I think The important when you're meeting with.

366
00:57:05,915 --> 00:57:07,915
Your employees on one-on-one basis.

367
00:57:07,915 --> 00:57:15,615
If we're assuming that more flexibility, means that you also have more ownership of your space, meaning that you might have fewer meetings.

368
00:57:15,715 --> 00:57:19,915
That means that the meetings times that you do have you have to make them count.

369
00:57:20,015 --> 00:57:41,515
And so having the ability to approach a conversation with an employee and not just checking off the list of work-related things, but checking in on the person themselves and how, and how they're doing and how they're Managing all the things because you're not seeing the micro kitchen interaction.

370
00:57:41,515 --> 00:57:42,715
You're not seeing that person.

371
00:57:42,715 --> 00:57:46,715
There's no longer going to the micro kitchen engaging with other employees.

372
00:57:46,715 --> 00:57:47,615
Like they always do.

373
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:57,115
So those missed opportunities of Engagement requires you to lean in and more to understand how employees are actually doing.

374
00:57:57,115 --> 00:57:57,415
Is that?

375
00:57:57,415 --> 00:58:05,515
So I think, I think managers have to be equipped differently in a distributed Workforce and understand.

376
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:15,115
The importance of weaning into those intentional conversations drawing off of your employees, what's happening, and how to be proactive.

377
00:58:15,115 --> 00:58:26,115
And not just unblocking but having a conversation with your employee when you see and sense the signals sort of piling up where you can have an employee.

378
00:58:26,115 --> 00:58:29,215
That's always small example, right?

379
00:58:29,215 --> 00:58:35,515
For folks that are jumping into a zoom call right after this, but you can have an employee that you always know has brought good energy.

380
00:58:35,615 --> 00:58:45,515
To a meeting is always greeting folks, or having the small talk, and if that person you're noticing, is not doing that as often as a manager.

381
00:58:45,515 --> 00:58:52,915
Now, you have to pay attention to that and follow up and check on that employee versus, you know, just talking it up.

382
00:58:52,915 --> 00:58:56,115
As, you know, they're just not vocal anymore.

383
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:58,215
They're just not leaving in like the way they used to.

384
00:58:58,515 --> 00:59:02,115
So, I think at a high level, I think that there needs to be investment middle managers.

385
00:59:02,115 --> 00:59:05,115
I think it goes from a training and policy.

386
00:59:05,615 --> 00:59:09,815
Active tooling perspective and is the work to be done, right?

387
00:59:09,815 --> 00:59:11,015
As we're all engaging in this.

388
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:23,215
And now on the flip side, yes, there hasn't been many managers leading remote teams, but then there's also companies who have also been leading remote teams for a long time.

389
00:59:23,215 --> 00:59:25,015
And there's best practices out there.

390
00:59:25,215 --> 00:59:35,215
So if you're looking for like the playbooks and how to lead remote teams, there's ton of resources, you can go to get lab first as a see what they're doing on their side.

391
00:59:35,215 --> 00:59:35,515
Always.

392
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:41,915
Your HR also has public playbooks as well on how to structure these meetings in these conversations.

393
00:59:42,115 --> 00:59:45,015
So there're resources out there but yes, no doubt.

394
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:50,015
The rows of managers are evolving and us that are leading.

395
00:59:50,015 --> 00:59:53,515
These companies are thinking about this stuff are asking the question.

396
00:59:53,515 --> 00:59:56,015
How do I clipped that middle manager?

397
00:59:56,515 --> 01:00:03,215
Well, I love to ask just like a tactical question to you all, you know, Roberto.

398
01:00:03,215 --> 01:00:10,815
I think what you mentioned was that you can sense when folks maybe our disengaging a little bit and their signals.

399
01:00:11,915 --> 01:00:16,015
What are the things that each of you look for in your leadership team?

400
01:00:16,015 --> 01:00:22,915
Like how you know, we're what's a majority of our time remote, you're just seeing somebody in this little virtual box.

401
01:00:23,215 --> 01:00:25,715
So how are you picking up those cues?

402
01:00:26,615 --> 01:00:28,015
I would love to share, it's funny.

403
01:00:28,115 --> 01:00:40,915
That's I think a great area to dig deeper and all, maybe share some experiences and questions we used to unearth those both probably very meaningful and important feelings to Anchor into the context.

404
01:00:40,915 --> 01:00:47,315
I read this article, it was like from Ink or Forbes and it was from a fortune like ten CEO, and she's like, here's a top 10 questions.

405
01:00:47,315 --> 01:00:51,015
I ask all my Executives at a rather questions, like these are fantastic.

406
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:55,315
And, so I copied them, and they pasted them into, we call it a goal, set and review.

407
01:00:55,315 --> 01:00:59,615
It's a just a weekly 121 between every team lead and the employee.

408
01:00:59,815 --> 01:01:00,915
And we have about 10 questions.

409
01:01:00,915 --> 01:01:05,115
We run through to dig deeper into like the real meaningful stuff of life.

410
01:01:05,115 --> 01:01:14,015
And so, for example, some of the questions we asked one of them is like, what's the best thing that happened to you this week either at work or outside of work.

411
01:01:14,115 --> 01:01:18,315
So, kind of opening it up, making it, making it safe for people to talk outside of work or in work.

412
01:01:18,715 --> 01:01:20,715
And I have had some amazing Revelations.

413
01:01:20,715 --> 01:01:28,315
I have had people like One account executive, Tom told me that after quite a long time with trying him and his wife finally were able to you know, get pregnant.

414
01:01:28,515 --> 01:01:34,715
Instead, they're going to have a new baby, the September, I had another girl Lauren choose from our customer success.

415
01:01:34,715 --> 01:01:41,715
Team, tell me about her, the trials and tribulations of an upcoming wedding and how was creating a lot of stress in her work life?

416
01:01:41,915 --> 01:01:45,515
And then afterwards, I was able to catch up and find out what find out about.

417
01:01:45,515 --> 01:01:49,115
What an amazing day that was another?

418
01:01:49,115 --> 01:01:54,015
I think even better, but subtle question is to ask people on a scale of 1 to 10.

419
01:01:54,015 --> 01:01:55,815
How happy are you, how happy are you?

420
01:01:55,815 --> 01:01:56,415
And why?

421
01:01:56,615 --> 01:01:59,415
Like a lot of times, we walk around a life where Okay, how are you doing?

422
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:05,015
And somebody can say fine, but in their, in their reality, maybe they're struggling to pay rent, so maybe their dad, just died.

423
01:02:05,015 --> 01:02:18,715
But fine is the same answer across the board, but when you ask for a number out of 10, like they're going to give you a 3 or a 6, or a 9 and then you can dig deeper again it kind of creates this moment of safety to ask a follow-up question.

424
01:02:18,715 --> 01:02:20,415
Like hey you want to share more about that.

425
01:02:21,115 --> 01:02:26,915
Something else is really interesting around the asking how somebody is out of ten as I found people have different baselines.

426
01:02:26,915 --> 01:02:28,315
Some people are naturally a 7.

427
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:34,715
210 week over week, some people are a 9 out of 10 and you can kind of in your own head, kind of watch that trend line go up or down.

428
01:02:35,015 --> 01:02:42,615
If somebody goes from like, say at 92 a 5 or 4 for a couple weeks, there's something really important in your life, that you should be digging deeper in on.

429
01:02:43,915 --> 01:02:48,815
And then, lastly, I think, you know, under this for the sake of transparency, just Global Leadership.

430
01:02:48,815 --> 01:02:53,215
We always ask the question, how can I be a better leader like if you like it?

431
01:02:53,215 --> 01:03:03,815
I think, in any communication, you have to open it up and make it truly two ways and in my experience, You won't get a lot of answers to that but when you do it's really heartfelt and there's these great learning moments.

432
01:03:03,815 --> 01:03:09,815
And again it's about creating this High trust relationships where people could communicate and go deeper and build long deep.

433
01:03:09,815 --> 01:03:12,515
Meaningful relationships at work.

434
01:03:12,615 --> 01:03:17,515
So those are a few of the questions we asked, but I love to hear from Rob's take on this as well.

435
01:03:19,615 --> 01:03:20,215
I think it's great.

436
01:03:20,215 --> 01:03:30,315
I will just add a short one, so we can cut you because I think you guys covered it extremely well, I think one thing that becomes really important to hit our thinking around.

437
01:03:30,315 --> 01:03:41,215
When you move into a more hybrid or distributed or remote type of environment is your managers kind of like and I think we're going to describe as like middle management.

438
01:03:41,215 --> 01:03:47,715
I would think about is like anybody do basically is a, you know, is from managing a direct team to managing man.

439
01:03:47,915 --> 01:04:15,315
Jurors for example, but maybe is not part of executive leadership or kind of like a direct report of the CEO, for example, like they don't just have an important role and kind of like translating top-down thinking or priorities down to the team but actually I think in a hybrid and remote World, their ability to Bubble Up relative sentiment and what's working and not working upward is actually far more important even than it was Prior you know in terms of different models.

440
01:04:15,315 --> 01:04:22,715
And the reason why is that it's kind of like A fairly simple one which is you know we used to all be in the office.

441
01:04:22,715 --> 01:04:29,015
I can walk around or you could walk around you kind of like pick up little signals on energy.

442
01:04:29,015 --> 01:04:30,715
Facial expressions, Etc.

443
01:04:30,715 --> 01:04:32,415
You grab someone for two minutes.

444
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:40,315
Like the amount of people, I think people ground, so to speak that you can cover, you know, in a day when everybody's in the office is quite extensive, right?

445
01:04:42,015 --> 01:04:46,415
When everyone is not in the office, every day is actually a bit harder to clean that signal, right?

446
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:49,715
And the folks that actually Your most likely to get clear.

447
01:04:49,715 --> 01:04:56,315
And true signal is a Frontline manager who may have built that relationship and a one-on-one and be able to sing to get that.

448
01:04:56,615 --> 01:05:14,115
But if you don't create a space where there's comfort and manager, raising that up and being like, hey, look, I am noticing a couple of things in my team, you know, that maybe other folks might be seeing as well, and then create the right Forum to be able to share that information to, hey, look, is that emblematic of some bigger issue, culturally or operationally?

449
01:05:14,115 --> 01:05:15,715
That we need to fix that.

450
01:05:15,715 --> 01:05:17,715
I think getting this right gets a lot harder.

451
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:21,015
So tactical advice around.

452
01:05:21,015 --> 01:05:45,015
That is one, make an effort from the way you talked about culture and great culture to make managers feel like it's a safe space to Bubble Up concerns that they're hearing from front lines, you know, in terms of what's working or not working or how they're feeling to we use our monthly people manager forums, as I mentioned is a way of saying, hey look, we have a dedicated item on the agenda every month which is just like, what are we hearing?

453
01:05:45,515 --> 01:05:47,715
What's coming up from direct reports what our issues?

454
01:05:47,815 --> 01:05:49,315
Is how we're folks dealing?

455
01:05:49,315 --> 01:05:51,615
Are we seeing that in one place kind of in?

456
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:55,915
Its just idiosyncratic to that place or is it widespread across all manager groups?

457
01:05:56,115 --> 01:06:07,115
But if you don't create that space for like that, really critical information, the bubble up, you can lose signal really fast, and not recognize an issue, or a cultural problem or something else.

458
01:06:07,115 --> 01:06:12,715
And so, you really have to empower managers to operate, kind of like two ways in that regard.

459
01:06:14,815 --> 01:06:16,415
It's really good.

460
01:06:16,415 --> 01:06:25,715
So being able to create those feedback loops and that safety, ultimately that, that safety for the middle management layer to be able to bubble that up.

461
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:27,115
That's great.

462
01:06:27,115 --> 01:06:33,815
All right, we have got only 10 minutes, believe you're not in our panel time, and we still have some questions here from the audience.

463
01:06:33,815 --> 01:06:36,215
I would love to tackle one, that's being upvoted.

464
01:06:36,215 --> 01:06:42,615
Pretty high as from wisdom, how do you engage remote employees to stay ahead in the retention battle?

465
01:06:45,715 --> 01:06:46,915
Anyone feel free to jump in.

466
01:06:49,515 --> 01:06:53,115
It's a, okay, I can share some hybrid perspective on it.

467
01:06:53,115 --> 01:06:55,015
But why don't you take remote Roberto if you want to?

468
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:56,615
I can talk a little bit more about the hybrid element.

469
01:06:56,615 --> 01:06:56,915
Rob.

470
01:06:56,915 --> 01:06:57,315
I wasn't.

471
01:06:57,415 --> 01:06:59,115
I was just going to just pass the ball to you.

472
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:01,915
So you go ahead and jump in, all right?

473
01:07:01,915 --> 01:07:12,315
Well, so I will talk a little bit, maybe about from a hybrid perspective, which is probably where we spend more energy thinking about it and that I think they will be certain pieces of that, the better applicable to remote to, and you can talk more about it.

474
01:07:12,315 --> 01:07:17,215
But I think, you know, maybe this ties to into something that may be another.

475
01:07:17,315 --> 01:07:36,415
Folk Minds, if, if the whole focus of this conversation, the way we think about how work is evolving is related to flexibility, I certainly don't think the answer is kind of being overly rigid, you know in a non-intentional way in terms of like where and how people do their work.

476
01:07:36,815 --> 01:07:47,215
And one of the interesting things that we started to find is there be discussions from companies or announcements as hey, I want everybody in the office you know, on Tuesdays.

477
01:07:47,315 --> 01:07:50,915
Traditional everybody to, you know, to be in the office during these times.

478
01:07:50,915 --> 01:07:56,315
And, yeah, I think what I found so far, and he kind of shows up consistently, not just in our users.

479
01:07:56,315 --> 01:08:02,015
But in research that I have seen is people want to be treated like adults, you know?

480
01:08:02,015 --> 01:08:17,115
And if there's one thing that really happened during the pandemic, it's folks, proved pretty concretely that they can be incredibly effective without having to be in the office and so if you tell them, I need you back in the office and that doesn't sound like a real.

481
01:08:17,314 --> 01:08:20,314
Real reason or there's not like some intentionality around it.

482
01:08:20,415 --> 01:08:25,415
People cry foul pretty fast and given the opportunities around distributive work.

483
01:08:25,814 --> 01:08:31,215
One data point that I found really interesting that came out of LinkedIn was something like hitting gone from at one point.

484
01:08:31,215 --> 01:08:40,015
Two percent of the jobs posted on LinkedIn, had a remote eligible to something like 25% and if you just think about the math of that it really over simplified terms.

485
01:08:40,314 --> 01:08:47,115
It means that the average person has like 10x 20x, the number of opportunities available to them because of remote work.

486
01:08:47,314 --> 01:08:51,515
Used to be available before and so people just aren't going to be here for that.

487
01:08:51,715 --> 01:08:52,715
They're not right?

488
01:08:52,715 --> 01:09:04,015
And so the biggest piece of advice they give to companies is like communicate like the thinking behind why you want folks to do what they do and make sure there's some intentionality around it, right?

489
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:11,615
And if you can give that flexibility at the team level or the department level to kind of figure out their own Norms based on what works well for them.

490
01:09:11,615 --> 01:09:17,115
And folks can operate within that instead of saying, hey, look blanket across the company, you know, I see.

491
01:09:17,314 --> 01:09:20,814
Yeah, I think it's good for people to be in the office three days a week and that works with my schedule.

492
01:09:20,814 --> 01:09:29,615
So everybody's going to do that, people say not for me, you know, I am going to go elsewhere, I think that happens really fast, and so I think that's one way to kind of stay ahead of it.

493
01:09:30,515 --> 01:09:41,015
And the other thing that's top of mind for me is like when I think this does really fast, you have remote and hybrid work cultures, is it shines a light on Mike relative quality of culture really quickly?

494
01:09:41,314 --> 01:09:47,115
Because in a world where I can be at my laptop in sign out of one flag account and sign into somebody else.

495
01:09:47,314 --> 01:09:50,115
Black accounts and effectively have switched companies, right?

496
01:09:50,115 --> 01:09:53,015
Like something around vision and Mission.

497
01:09:53,015 --> 01:09:54,715
And why do we do the work that we do?

498
01:09:54,715 --> 01:09:58,015
And the impact went to have on the world becomes really, really important.

499
01:09:58,015 --> 01:10:01,215
And so companies have to invest in that and Clarity.

500
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,015
And like why are we here?

501
01:10:03,015 --> 01:10:04,515
And why is this important?

502
01:10:04,615 --> 01:10:07,015
And are we hiring people that are values aligned?

503
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,415
Because otherwise, we're just gonna go, right?

504
01:10:09,415 --> 01:10:14,815
There's just too many opportunities out there and the whole strength of your culture and the differentiation around.

505
01:10:14,815 --> 01:10:16,915
That is one of the things that will keep people engaged.

506
01:10:20,715 --> 01:10:21,415
So good.

507
01:10:21,615 --> 01:10:22,615
Thank you rob.

508
01:10:23,115 --> 01:10:26,615
All right, we're going to answer another question here from Stephanie Jones.

509
01:10:26,615 --> 01:10:34,515
How do you support remote workers in setting up their physical office space to reduce physical pain symptoms?

510
01:10:34,515 --> 01:10:36,815
We are seeing increases of that, right?

511
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:39,015
Lower back pain, neck pain, Etc.

512
01:10:41,115 --> 01:10:47,115
This is an interesting one we hosted in one of our event series here called changing how we work.

513
01:10:47,115 --> 01:10:53,315
We host it, Chris heard, who is a CEO of a company called first base.

514
01:10:53,715 --> 01:11:06,315
First base .h, I mean, first base hq.com, I think, is this, there is their website and what they basically do is like, they equipped the remote employee with their office fittings, right?

515
01:11:06,315 --> 01:11:09,615
So I think it's really important that companies.

516
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:18,415
Not just hire folks who remotely but think about how do they equip them in their space to be a safe space?

517
01:11:18,515 --> 01:11:20,315
Like get the to office chair.

518
01:11:20,315 --> 01:11:20,915
Yes, it costs.

519
01:11:20,915 --> 01:11:23,215
A few hundred bucks, get the standing desk.

520
01:11:23,315 --> 01:11:25,215
Yes, it costs a few hundred bucks.

521
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:28,715
Get the right keyboard, get the right Mouse, invest in those things.

522
01:11:28,715 --> 01:11:36,515
Give employees, The Hit List of the best products to make sure that they have the best setup, so they can do their best work.

523
01:11:37,315 --> 01:11:39,815
So I think it's one investing actual dollars.

524
01:11:39,915 --> 01:11:42,215
To help employees do that.

525
01:11:42,315 --> 01:11:45,915
And I think S I think that in this is an area to improve.

526
01:11:45,915 --> 01:12:14,015
I think it's Car Technology out there but there's got to be ways to actually educate also in train folks on the best practices on getting up, moving around, you know, the small tip there's in your Google calendar, there's something called I think Speedy mint meetings and it basically forces your meetings from Two minutes to 25 minutes from 60 Minutes to 50 minutes.

527
01:12:14,015 --> 01:12:20,215
So that always gives you five minutes for every 30 minutes back and it also gives you 10 minutes for every 60 Minutes back.

528
01:12:20,515 --> 01:12:22,615
And so, the question is, how do you use that?

529
01:12:22,715 --> 01:12:27,515
All right, take a break, go for the coffee, walk around, do those things.

530
01:12:27,515 --> 01:12:40,615
So I think it goes both ways, not just on the equipment having the right setup, but also the training that for a better way of working from home, That's great.

531
01:12:40,615 --> 01:12:41,715
Thanks, Roberto.

532
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:45,115
Alright I am going to keep tackling these questions because we got five minutes left.

533
01:12:45,115 --> 01:12:48,615
Alright, so here's an interesting one.

534
01:12:49,715 --> 01:12:52,915
Do you find that on boarding and training remote?

535
01:12:52,915 --> 01:13:00,115
Employees are more challenging than in office employees, especially for employees right out of school?

536
01:13:02,715 --> 01:13:06,715
I would, I would say in my experience, absolutely.

537
01:13:08,415 --> 01:13:14,215
We because you're not face-to-face, it doesn't allow for those micro conversations.

538
01:13:14,215 --> 01:13:19,315
As micro-moments could pop up where people can chat between each other and allow you to rapidly fix an issue issues.

539
01:13:19,315 --> 01:13:20,615
Might kind of simmer below the surface.

540
01:13:22,215 --> 01:13:32,615
Something we did is we just took the time to like map out the entire onboarding experience starting with like the first job interview are actually part of me even before that is looking at our curb page on our website.

541
01:13:32,715 --> 01:13:37,415
In like mapping it from sort of 0 to 10, is a good experience, or a bad experience.

542
01:13:37,715 --> 01:13:40,715
And once that was all mapped out where able to pinpoint where we're strong and weak.

543
01:13:40,715 --> 01:13:49,815
So I was like, step one and step two, we created like a really specific repeatable onboarding Playbook, which is like is pretty darn granular.

544
01:13:49,815 --> 01:13:54,015
And some of the cool things we use like tools, like doughnut till I was serendipitous conversations.

545
01:13:54,015 --> 01:13:59,815
We have like the day one of Jenna's mapped out hour by hour for every single employee.

546
01:14:01,615 --> 01:14:02,515
In fact, the whole weeks.

547
01:14:02,615 --> 01:14:05,815
Opt hour by hour from sort of day 1 to day 7.

548
01:14:06,015 --> 01:14:08,315
So we have all these consistent repeatable processes.

549
01:14:08,315 --> 01:14:15,515
And then we also collect feedback on day 30 and a 60, or employees can fill out a survey like how good of a job did we do on our onboarding changes?

550
01:14:15,715 --> 01:14:19,215
Because if you don't measure it, you can't truly prove whether it's working or not.

551
01:14:19,415 --> 01:14:25,215
But those are kind of three steps we have taken mostly because we wanted to get ahead of like get ahead.

552
01:14:25,315 --> 01:14:27,215
We didn't want to bad onboarding experience.

553
01:14:27,215 --> 01:14:33,015
That I have heard some stories where we previously been doing a good job, and we also have you delivered a Job?

554
01:14:33,015 --> 01:14:41,915
And that's really frustrating to me if I can't deliver that consistently great experience so that was the trigger for those kind of three processes that we rolled our internally.

555
01:14:43,315 --> 01:14:44,215
That's great.

556
01:14:44,415 --> 01:14:44,715
All right.

557
01:14:44,715 --> 01:14:45,815
Just do two time.

558
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:50,615
I don't think we could get to all the questions but I do want to ask a question of each of you.

559
01:14:51,415 --> 01:14:57,615
Of course, we're talking about predictions here and future, and so we I would love to hear from each of you.

560
01:14:58,215 --> 01:15:07,215
What is the one top prediction that you are excited about and you are prioritizing for your organization?

561
01:15:09,715 --> 01:15:14,715
Maybe there're two questions in there, but I would love to hear from each of you and I will start with you Rob.

562
01:15:18,815 --> 01:15:21,715
Top the top prediction that we're prioritizing organization.

563
01:15:22,015 --> 01:15:35,515
I think that the top prediction is that I think the majority of the world that is capable of working remotely will operate a hybrid environment time, not just next year, but into the future, right?

564
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:42,615
And I think the biggest barrier around that is purely going to be the ability to make it that people can work in the right place at the right time.

565
01:15:42,815 --> 01:15:46,815
You know, that your home on the right days or in the office on the right days you can get the right people together.

566
01:15:46,915 --> 01:15:55,215
So we spent all of Energy from a product perspective, trying to make that as easy as possible, which coincidentally is the biggest investment I can make in some ways in our own company?

567
01:15:55,215 --> 01:16:01,815
You know, how we do this internally to make that really easy for folks, to be able to get together the office at the right time or out of the right time.

568
01:16:01,815 --> 01:16:07,215
And so in my mind it's that hybrid is the future from majority of folks.

569
01:16:07,215 --> 01:16:09,815
I would say and intentionality around that.

570
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,315
I think it's just extremely Accord.

571
01:16:11,315 --> 01:16:13,015
That's what we're, that's what we're focused on.

572
01:16:13,115 --> 01:16:13,715
I am helping with.

573
01:16:15,415 --> 01:16:18,315
Thanks, I will head off to you Roberto Yeah, cool.

574
01:16:18,315 --> 01:16:33,115
I think it's in this future sort of like, thinking about what's happening like to think about a short-term or long-term, but I will stick to like, it just in between and I think that the in between is that there's going to be much more digital Nomads.

575
01:16:33,115 --> 01:16:41,815
There's going to be a lot of people that are just owning their careers and their part sizing life first, and then work.

576
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:45,315
And I think that's a big shift that is going to happen.

577
01:16:45,315 --> 01:16:47,415
Is, you know what, I want to live this life, dear.

578
01:16:47,615 --> 01:17:06,915
For I work this way and there's a journey and it cooked in people to think differently about that, not just employees, but employers, making sure that people know the expectations, making sure that there's this outcome driven, you do with your time, with to need to go do this, is, what's what Excellence looks like at the job.

579
01:17:07,115 --> 01:17:10,515
Go be excellent and go live, an excellent life on your terms.

580
01:17:10,615 --> 01:17:17,415
And I think that it's a foundation of trust and that's a big shift that still going to have to happen in employment.

581
01:17:17,515 --> 01:17:33,415
In general, it's like trusting employees to do their job, you hired him to do the job, give them clear expectations and let them go surf every day if they want to in the morning as long as the job gets done, Love that Jason close up.

582
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:37,015
Yeah, I think Roberto and Rob give fantastic answers.

583
01:17:37,015 --> 01:17:38,715
I gave a slightly quirky answer.

584
01:17:38,715 --> 01:17:44,515
I am fascinated by the future but I think because so many people are going into remote distributed hybrid environments.

585
01:17:44,515 --> 01:17:55,215
There's this really cool infrastructure change where transportation is going to get better new real estate and communities are going to grow but like whether its self-driving cars there's this really cool company called jobby.

586
01:17:55,215 --> 01:17:58,915
It's like this quadcopter that holds any between around for people.

587
01:17:58,915 --> 01:18:00,015
They're going to equip it with us.

588
01:18:00,215 --> 01:18:01,215
Flying model.

589
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:11,915
So I think how we get around we literally show up on the world will change making commute times faster and more exciting, and I am really excited about that feature so yeah that's my quirky answer that question.

590
01:18:12,915 --> 01:18:14,315
Thank you so much.

591
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:18,515

It's part panel.

10
00:18:58,952 --> 00:19:08,552
We're going to be talking about how you can lead distributed teams with compassion with empathy and some very tactical ways in doing that.

11
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:14,852
And then the second part of our event will be drumroll for real.

15
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:42,052

17
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:57,852
All right?

18
00:19:58,052 --> 00:20:08,252
So jumping into our panel topic today, you know, as we all are feeling this, you know, we're dealing with remote work.

19
00:20:08,352 --> 00:20:19,352
And on one side, there's an amazing upside of the quality of life, but there's also the challenge, Challenge of eroded boundaries between work and personal life.

20
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:28,352
And, you know, there's this need right now, the craving that employees have what whether your remote weather, your hybrid, whatever your situation is that you're working.

21
00:20:29,152 --> 00:20:39,552
The common denominator is that employees are seeking that support and that connection that value, like I value you.

22
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:47,252
And I value that you're here part of our organization at as you're navigating these Teas with a distributed workplace.

23
00:20:47,252 --> 00:20:55,952
There's some key ways in which we as leaders and managers and even individual contributors can show up and support one another.

24
00:20:56,152 --> 00:21:02,952
You know, there's this statistic here that shows employees who work for compassionate manager.

25
00:21:03,352 --> 00:21:07,152
Their 25% more engaged in their jobs.

26
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:14,852
20% of them are more committed to the organization and 11% are less likely to burn.

27
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:21,352
Burnout Katie's going to drop in chat the research there so you can double-click into that a little bit more.

28
00:21:21,552 --> 00:21:28,652
But you know the research shows it rights there that compassionate managers and leaders do make a big difference.

29
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:36,152
So with that I would love to introduce our panel today.

30
00:21:36,552 --> 00:21:44,852
We have got Kim who is the head of employee experience with oyster Bobby, the regional director of people.

39
00:22:10,052 --> 00:22:10,652

40
00:22:10,852 --> 00:22:17,752
Let us know what boy stur is about and what do you get to do every day with them?

41
00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:20,152
Well, hello.

42
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:22,252
Nice to be here to see you all.

43
00:22:22,752 --> 00:22:25,852
I am with a company called oyster.

44
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:30,752
We are Employment platform that helps companies to hire people anywhere in the world.

45
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:36,452
So that you are not a cure not limited to the talent pool, that happens to be within a geographic radius of your office.

46
00:22:36,752 --> 00:22:44,552
Or if you don't have enough, it's like oyster, you can hire anyone anywhere in the world without the legal administrative, HR headache.

47
00:22:44,552 --> 00:22:58,552
That comes with anyone on this call who is part of an HRT, more people obscene those that it's very complicated to hire people outside of your, your space oyster is over 600 employees now, and we're going Now, over 70 countries.

48
00:22:59,052 --> 00:23:09,252
So we are an extremely globally, distributed team, and I get to spend my days building and trying to make sure that we have a consistent employee experience.

49
00:23:09,252 --> 00:23:23,352
No matter where you are in the world, no matter whether you have overlapping time zones with anyone else on your team, trying to ensure that everyone feels a sense of inclusion on belonging and has a really seamless and great experience being a part of the oyster team.

50
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:26,352
And I am calling in from my home office.

51
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:32,052
Which is About one square meter of the corner of my living room.

52
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:35,852
So, welcome to my, welcome to my home.

53
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:41,052
Thanks for letting us in love it.

54
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:42,652
Bobby, how about you?

55
00:23:42,652 --> 00:23:43,852
Tell us a little bit about culture.

56
00:23:43,852 --> 00:23:45,752
Ab and what you get to do with them?

57
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:47,952
Yeah, thank you first.

58
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:50,752
Thank you for your enthusiasm and your excitement.

59
00:23:50,752 --> 00:23:56,452
You're getting a lot of love around your energy in the chat there and also Kim, a lot of love for oyster to.

60
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:59,152
So, It's great to see as it was mentioned.

61
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:00,552
My name is Bobby Malloy.

62
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:03,952
My role at culture amp is as Regional director of people science.

63
00:24:03,952 --> 00:24:11,852
As Kim was saying, she helps cultivate an employee experience, and we are an employee experience platform that helps users.

64
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:14,852
Like Kim cultivate that experience in your organization.

65
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:21,352
So, we are a software platform sort of end to end in terms of experience.

66
00:24:21,352 --> 00:24:26,352
So from candidate and onboarding through engagement and performance.

67
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:29,852
And development all the way through exit and alumni.

68
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:42,452
We have you covered there and so in our role in people science we are a group of people with backgrounds and Industrial organizational psychology and organizational development.

69
00:24:42,552 --> 00:24:47,752
And we help you design tools in our platform in service of cultivating, your experience strategy.

70
00:24:48,152 --> 00:25:08,352
So whether that looks like actually designing those tools or helping you interpret, some of the data that you get back, when you send out employee surveys, or you go oh, through a performance management process or you have a development cycle for your employees, were there with you, to help you kind of craft that strategy and then ultimately take action.

71
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:13,152
So ultimately, it's all in the service of improving the workplace.

72
00:25:13,352 --> 00:25:14,052
Happy to be here.

73
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:15,852
Love it.

74
00:25:15,852 --> 00:25:17,052
Well, we're glad you're here.

75
00:25:17,552 --> 00:25:29,052
So, you know, we're talking about this research that I just pulled up on how employees who work for compassionate, managers are likely to be more engaged.

76
00:25:29,052 --> 00:25:32,652
They are more committed to an org, they're less likely to burn out.

77
00:25:32,752 --> 00:25:39,452
Now each of you are seeing the data or creating the experience to further encourage this.

78
00:25:39,452 --> 00:25:44,052
Now there's a lot of going on right now in the world, you know, you go on LinkedIn.

79
00:25:44,052 --> 00:25:47,752
There's a new Said that just got laid off and you're just like, ah, gosh.

80
00:25:47,752 --> 00:25:51,952
This is a very unstable uncomfortable time.

81
00:25:52,252 --> 00:26:06,552
And so how do you create engagement and motivation within a workplace particularly, if recently, somebody's gone through substantial layoffs, how can we do that as Leaders managers?

82
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:17,052
I have you to start work about, we both like jumped in at the same time I will give it a start on a pass it on to you.

83
00:26:17,652 --> 00:26:49,552
I think the thing to remember about all of this as is that as much as we desperately need data and metrics and thus like people science that we're all here, we're all so culture, a I am a decade-long culture, a superfan, if we need, all of that data to help build the business case, Says, I am and build and an objective viewpoint on overall holistic Trends, but at the core of it, we're dealing with people, we're dealing with humans.

84
00:26:49,552 --> 00:26:54,152
And so taking this human Centric approach to realizing that everyone has stuff going on in their lives.

85
00:26:54,152 --> 00:27:09,452
Everyone has a life outside of work and that's something that and depend on McCrea, Lee brought to light in a way that maybe people were able to hide or create a line between their home lives and their work lives pre-pandemic in a way that we just haven't been able too lately.

86
00:27:09,452 --> 00:27:16,952
And so creating that level of Engagement is it's not about saying, well what do we need to do to increase our engagement score?

87
00:27:16,952 --> 00:27:30,952
It's what do we need to do to support the whole human that showing up to work whether that's showing up in a co-working space, showing up in a physical office showing up on a call with their toddler hanging off of them because their school had a closure like these things.

88
00:27:30,952 --> 00:27:38,852
All Impact how we can show up at work and how we show up at work is how we experience our engagement Network.

89
00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:51,152
If people feel supported, and they feel heard, and they feel like their full life experience, Eiffel lived experience can be represented in their workplace then that will translate into higher level of Engagement.

90
00:27:53,852 --> 00:28:05,852
I would say the example that you use of the outset was around layoffs and ultimately that's under the umbrella of something that we might consider to be a hard time.

91
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,352
There're a layoffs there's the pandemic.

92
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:14,152
There's Any number of examples that you could use but ultimately it is an example of change.

93
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:25,752
And so when you're thinking about, how do we either lean in or lean out, think about the fact that whenever there is change, you should be leaning into helping to make sure that change goes smoothly.

94
00:28:25,952 --> 00:28:48,552
Now, you do that with number one, like open acknowledgement, so don't put your head in the sand and acknowledge when there is a layoff acknowledge when there are hard times going on in the world around us and With creating the space, to give people the grace to express how those challenges might be affecting them but then also solicit feedback from your employees.

95
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:52,552
So, get a sense for what's going, well during this change, what's not going.

96
00:28:52,552 --> 00:28:58,552
So well during this change so that you can focus your efforts on improving, the things that are not going.

97
00:28:58,552 --> 00:29:04,052
Well, I would say in terms of layoffs, think about it from three levels.

98
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:22,052
Think about it from the organization level acknowledge you know you can Get feedback in aggregate across the organization, but it's probably a little bit demoralizing to communicate, a layoff to your employees and for your employees to hear that about their organization.

99
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:30,952
And so you need to understand how they're feeling in order to tailor your Communications in ways that are going to get them remote abated and re-engaged.

100
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:38,852
For managers, you know, really help employees understand why these decisions were made and how these decisions were made giving.

101
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:40,052
See to the process.

102
00:29:40,052 --> 00:29:56,752
Can help people really feel like there was fairness and equity in the decisions that were made so that they remain motivated to continue working for you and then employees, you know, you might have something like survivor's guilt, which tends to be pretty common as a result of layoffs.

103
00:29:56,752 --> 00:30:15,052
And so if that's the case, acknowledge that to your mentor, to your manager, but also really acknowledge when you're overwhelmed or overworked because speaking up is what's going to get you, the That you need so that you're not oppressed by, you know, the lean way of working now that other people have been laid off.

104
00:30:16,952 --> 00:30:24,252
And I would just like to add one thing to that, which is this idea of acknowledging, the pain, the pain of it.

105
00:30:24,352 --> 00:30:34,252
And acknowledging, the hook, the difficulty of it, I am not saying that you should say post a selfie crying about how hard it was for you, to lay off your staff.

106
00:30:34,652 --> 00:30:41,052
But acknowledging, especially for the people who are still there that like this is hard, this is a hard thing for us to go through as a business.

107
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:43,552
It's a hard thing for us to lose people who we love working with.

108
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:59,652
This is the Why we had to make this decision and how we made this decision, and we just want to acknowledge that it's painful and it's difficult for all of us, and we want to move through this together, but we're not going to jump straight to action.

109
00:30:59,652 --> 00:31:02,752
We're not going to jump straight past your grief for your struggle or challenges.

110
00:31:02,752 --> 00:31:05,452
Here's the safe way that we can talk about this.

111
00:31:05,452 --> 00:31:25,352
Here's might think about providing counseling services or reminding people about the Mental Health Resources, you have available, you can't just gloss over You see that a lot from leaders during layoffs, if they want to jump straight to but it's all going to be okay because here's our strong team that we're left with and that doesn't acknowledge the emotional experience.

112
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:28,452
That people are having as they're going through it.

113
00:31:30,352 --> 00:31:30,652
Wow.

114
00:31:30,652 --> 00:31:32,452
That's totally.

115
00:31:32,952 --> 00:31:33,252
Right.

116
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:36,752
Right on a very human in approach.

117
00:31:37,552 --> 00:31:39,552
How do you see that actually happening?

118
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:41,552
As far as the communication touchpoints?

119
00:31:41,552 --> 00:31:46,652
Like, there's the company level, there's the one-on-ones, there's the team seeing Inks.

120
00:31:46,652 --> 00:31:49,252
And there's may be other types of gatherings in between.

121
00:31:49,252 --> 00:31:54,852
So how do you, you know, in change management and these transitions?

122
00:31:54,852 --> 00:31:59,752
Like how, how do you communicate with transparency yet also have compassion?

123
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:02,452
And what does that look like cascaded?

124
00:32:05,152 --> 00:32:05,852
You want to take it?

125
00:32:07,452 --> 00:32:09,052
I was going to let you speak first this time.

126
00:32:09,152 --> 00:32:10,252
Okay, great.

127
00:32:11,152 --> 00:32:18,652
So there's a couple different angles that you could take especially with communication and some of which might not be obvious.

128
00:32:18,652 --> 00:32:26,752
So with strict communication, yes of course, leaders top-down, org-wide Communications, that's important.

129
00:32:27,652 --> 00:32:33,752
What I tend to see across organizational data over, let us say the past like eight months or so.

130
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:41,352
Communication is become one of the number-one drivers of Employee Engagement.

131
00:32:41,352 --> 00:32:55,052
And part of the reason is that people are using Communications, to understand what the future is for the organization, both in the near term and then over the long term, they want to know, coming out of a covid era.

132
00:32:55,052 --> 00:33:17,552
What's our plan, what's our vision and our mission and has that changed from before covid and or from, when I signed on for the organization, And with Communications and for organizations that have seen declines, they have audited their Communications, and they have realized that they have over index toward financial and other types of metrics.

133
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:25,952
And in those Communications they have really tried their thinking was, let us communicate how our profits are the highest.

134
00:33:25,952 --> 00:33:33,952
You know, that they have been in five years or, you know, all of these great numbers, but they have not Incorporated.

135
00:33:34,152 --> 00:33:38,652
It sort of humanistic perspective to those Communications.

136
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:44,852
So people are not necessarily seeing themselves represented in the success of the organization.

137
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:48,052
And there is a little bit of a lack of acknowledgements.

138
00:33:48,052 --> 00:33:53,852
For those organizations that the burdens that have been placed upon people through the covid era.

139
00:33:53,852 --> 00:34:03,152
Now, coming out of it, that the employees have carried in order to make those metrics as good as they are.

140
00:34:04,052 --> 00:34:17,052
And so, the I think the misalignment and perception is that, hey, we're doing this really great thing by showing all these great numbers, but we're not actually acknowledging that it was sacrificed that helped contribute to those numbers.

141
00:34:17,152 --> 00:34:23,052
And so injecting those Communications with a more humanistic perspective, is, is one action?

142
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:38,452
And the other is a little bit of a signal, not necessarily an overt communication, but even in your performance management process, if you have a self-reflective opportunity for employees, To sort of reflect on their experience over the past.

143
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:39,752
Let us say six months.

144
00:34:40,351 --> 00:34:45,252
Having within that, a question about what are some challenges or blockers?

145
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:48,052
That you faced either in work or out of work?

146
00:34:48,052 --> 00:35:03,852
That might have affected your job performance, allowing the Unseen especially in our remote work World, allowing the Unseen or the unheard to have a place for a manager, or a mentor to acknowledge that in a performance.

147
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:17,952
Evaluation can be really powerful and I meant that is a signal, it's not an overt communication but it is a signal that the organization cares about, you know, how the world or how those contextual factors are affecting you.

148
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:21,152
Absolutely.

149
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:31,452
And I think there's a piece of communication to think about, which is that At the end of the day humans are inherently selfish, right?

150
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:33,052
It's a survival mechanism.

151
00:35:33,052 --> 00:35:34,252
Have to think about ourselves.

152
00:35:34,252 --> 00:35:38,052
So any communication to make, think about how the person reading it is.

153
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,952
Going to look at that and say, okay, but what about me?

154
00:35:40,252 --> 00:35:41,252
How does that impact me?

155
00:35:41,652 --> 00:35:42,752
How does that affect my job?

156
00:35:42,752 --> 00:35:45,752
How does that impact my career growth has that picked impacts my work?

157
00:35:45,952 --> 00:35:53,052
If you talk about a shift in the product roadmap whoever's working on that project or adjacent projects are going to think.

158
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:54,452
What does that mean about my products?

159
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:57,152
That mean about the thing that I work on your talent?

160
00:35:57,352 --> 00:35:59,152
Doesn't even wonder does that mean we have to hire different?

161
00:35:59,152 --> 00:36:13,752
People your sales team is going to think it's that completely change our sales cycle so thinking about how everything you communicate is going to be interpreted at least you know not by every single one of your employees that would be a very big task but think about the kind of different personas within your company.

162
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:16,652
And how is this communication going to impact?

163
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:20,352
The person who is a live-in, caregiver for their elderly parent?

164
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,952
And how is it going to impact those employee?

165
00:36:21,952 --> 00:36:23,752
Who is about to go on, Parental leave?

166
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:25,152
And how's it going to impact this employee?

167
00:36:25,152 --> 00:36:26,752
Who just joined the sales team?

168
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,852
On the team that is now being restructured.

169
00:36:30,052 --> 00:36:32,852
Or, and like, thinking about, who is this going to impact the most?

170
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:38,152
But then also people who are not directly involved with it, how might they interpret this communication?

171
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:42,952
And how can I touch on as many levels of inclusion as possible?

172
00:36:45,252 --> 00:36:46,352
That's really great.

173
00:36:46,452 --> 00:36:53,352
I am seeing the question start to pop up, and we have got about 10 minutes till we have to transition over to the part two of today's event.

174
00:36:53,652 --> 00:36:56,252
So let us pull up marinas.

175
00:36:56,452 --> 00:37:04,452
Question servers question on to Stage here, Katie, okay, is compassion a learnable trait.

176
00:37:04,452 --> 00:37:08,152
If so, how do you prepare, new leaders or Future Leaders?

177
00:37:08,152 --> 00:37:09,652
To be compassionate.

178
00:37:09,652 --> 00:37:11,852
And I guess I have a question right above this.

179
00:37:11,852 --> 00:37:16,152
It's like, how do you define compassion is Different from empathy.

180
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,852
And then you can answer this one as well.

181
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:22,052
That is a good question.

182
00:37:22,052 --> 00:37:25,352
I don't, I am not a psych.

183
00:37:25,752 --> 00:37:27,552
I was not a psych major, I was a theater major.

184
00:37:28,552 --> 00:37:34,552
So in terms of defining compassion versus empathy, and we're like, where's the Venn diagram of intersection and the terminology?

185
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,252
I don't know.

186
00:37:35,652 --> 00:37:42,352
But I think it all relates back to this idea of EQ or being able to put yourself in someone else's shoes.

187
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:47,752
Think that is empathy that is compassionate is looking at someone else.

188
00:37:47,852 --> 00:37:56,952
And thinking about their experience, sometimes above your own, but sometimes in addition to your own looking at how is this person going to be impacted by what I say and do.

189
00:37:56,952 --> 00:38:00,152
And that is coachable.

190
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:00,852
That is learnable.

191
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:08,452
I think there are people who are inherently who have more of that in them inherently based on how they were raised or their brain chemistry, or whatever it is.

192
00:38:10,352 --> 00:38:16,252
But there are definitely people who see that as something that's like this is a skill, I need to learn and it's a foreign concept to me.

193
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:24,752
Not because I don't believe in Fashion, but because emotional breath is not part of my natural skill.

194
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:47,752
Set, depending on if you're looking at companies and neuro diversity, as a part of your, your inclusion thinking about, how can you include people who have varying levels of neuro diversity, that don't allow them to inherently connect with the emotions, the emotional response and you know, it's not just a neuro diversity.

195
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:49,852
Also, as to how you were raised paying it?

196
00:38:49,852 --> 00:38:52,452
So what kind of experience you had in previous companies?

197
00:38:52,452 --> 00:38:56,952
It's what you are allowed to be and how you're allowed to show up in a previous workplace.

198
00:38:58,152 --> 00:39:05,052
There are people who believe compassion and empathy are just completely separate from your work life and that's something you might have in your personal life, but it worked.

199
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:09,952
It's like all business and so really defining what that means at your company.

200
00:39:09,952 --> 00:39:12,352
What does it mean to be a compassionate leader?

201
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:13,652
What does it mean to be human Centric?

202
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:18,352
What does it mean to be empathetic, whatever language you used to define that part of your Culture?

203
00:39:19,352 --> 00:39:30,052
Anyone, regardless of their, their personal proclivity is towards empathy and compassion can learn how to participate in your culture because you have defined it really clearly.

204
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:33,152
As we want to be, we talk about it.

205
00:39:33,152 --> 00:39:38,952
Always starts being human Centric, but it's not enough to say we're human Centric company of say this is what it means to be human Centric at or Easter.

206
00:39:39,352 --> 00:39:58,752
So whether you live your life in a way where you would describe yourself as being human Centric, you know what the expectations are here, and that's what you Teach people, you might not be able to teach them like how to be a compassionate person 24/7 in their lives, but you can tell them how to show up compassionately at work and teach them what that looks like.

207
00:40:00,952 --> 00:40:04,752
Well said, Bobby, did you have anything to add to that?

208
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:17,452
I do think it was well said we typically consider we sort of my background is in sync in Psychology and emotions, and we consider compassion to be an emotional response.

209
00:40:17,752 --> 00:40:23,352
Whereas empathy is the feeling of another's, kind of emotions.

210
00:40:24,152 --> 00:40:31,252
When we have empathy, we can then have compassion and so compassion is an emotional response with a desire to help.

211
00:40:31,552 --> 00:40:46,252
And, so I think It was well said that we might not necessarily be able to teach people how to have an emotional response, but we can in train within them the behaviors.

212
00:40:46,352 --> 00:40:59,752
And also at an organizational level policy wide set, the expectation that people should be behaving in a way that demonstrates compassion doesn't necessarily mean, they have to know what it is to behave in that way.

213
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:14,452
But when this happens you As a mentored respond in this way, you send them to this person or you provide them this resource or you work with them to overcome their goal or to overcome the challenge to their goal.

214
00:41:15,252 --> 00:41:24,152
There are all kinds of like work-related within the scope of control of the organization behaviors that we can do that are compassionate.

215
00:41:24,352 --> 00:41:29,652
Even if you know we don't necessarily have to get to the point where we're just having an emotional skill.

216
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:30,152
Training.

217
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:33,452
That notwithstanding is also something new A do.

218
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:36,552
But yeah, I think focusing on the behaviors is right.

219
00:41:38,052 --> 00:41:39,152
We have got another question.

220
00:41:39,152 --> 00:41:43,452
That's getting a vote voted right now, more and more.

221
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:51,552
I see companies measuring commitment, instead of Engagement curious, as to your thoughts on this alternative approach.

222
00:41:53,252 --> 00:41:56,052
Would you mind if I jump in here first?

223
00:41:56,552 --> 00:42:08,252
So that's a great question and actually, so I culture amp our engagement index the way that we measure engagement includes commitment as one of three components.

224
00:42:08,552 --> 00:42:13,652
So we measure engagement with five items two of which are around commitment.

225
00:42:13,852 --> 00:42:22,952
Now, that's important because in this, in this conceptualization, which is consistent, with all of the research and scientific literature on engagement.

226
00:42:25,652 --> 00:42:30,252
Commitment is one part of what it means for an employee to be engaged.

227
00:42:30,252 --> 00:42:33,352
They cannot be fully engaged unless they're committed.

228
00:42:33,352 --> 00:42:38,252
But there are also other things that indicate an employee is engaged.

229
00:42:38,252 --> 00:42:43,252
And commitment is necessary, but not completely sufficient.

230
00:42:43,252 --> 00:42:52,652
And so if you think about just measuring commitment, there are a hosts of reasons why someone might be committed Beyond Simple Beyond them.

231
00:42:53,052 --> 00:42:54,152
We enjoy their job.

232
00:42:54,152 --> 00:42:57,952
I might be committed here because I have nowhere else to go.

233
00:42:58,152 --> 00:43:01,352
We saw this pretty strongly at the beginning of the covid.

234
00:43:01,352 --> 00:43:15,652
Pandemic commitment increased because other organizations were laying people off or downsizing and people became they sheltered in place was I think the popular phrasing at that point.

235
00:43:15,652 --> 00:43:22,852
And so there are all these external factors, and they're all these sort of contaminating factors that might contribute to why someone has committed.

236
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:27,252
But it doesn't necessarily mean that they actually want to do a good job for you.

237
00:43:27,752 --> 00:43:43,552
So we continue to measure engagement because it considers commitment along with the emotional, Affinity or investment that people have for your company, or your organization are they proud to work there, are they motivated to go above and beyond and to the extent that they're engaged, they would tend to do.

238
00:43:43,552 --> 00:43:46,552
So, would they recommend you as a great place to work?

239
00:43:46,552 --> 00:43:50,152
Those are the kinds of things that would indicate that someone is committed to you.

240
00:43:50,152 --> 00:43:52,752
They want to be with you for the long term.

241
00:43:53,052 --> 00:43:56,552
And while they're there, they will want to do good work.

242
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:01,452
Those three questions I think are really key which would you mind it?

243
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:13,452
Would it be okay if you drop that in chat for us because those are very clear questions that we could be asking or you know serving out to gauge that commitment.

244
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:14,352
All right.

245
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:15,052
Thank you, Bobbi.

246
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:20,852
We actually have a couple minutes left, and so I do want to get through at least another question here.

247
00:44:21,852 --> 00:44:25,152
Let us go with the anonymous question.

248
00:44:25,152 --> 00:44:27,252
I have read that engagement.

249
00:44:27,452 --> 00:44:29,152
Is the bare minimum.

250
00:44:29,152 --> 00:44:31,052
You should expect from your employees.

251
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:36,252
Disengaged employees equals reduced ARR with this in mind.

252
00:44:36,252 --> 00:44:39,852
What are some benchmarks for an Engaged Workforce?

253
00:44:45,152 --> 00:44:46,652
I am not, I am not exactly sure.

254
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:59,352
What we talked about engagement is the bare minimum, you should expect from your employees, and not sure exactly what that is, referring to, maybe Bobby if you want to take this and it's benchmarks for an Engaged Workforce.

255
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:05,252
We look at things like our culture and thank you, Sherman scores, across a bunch of different categories.

256
00:45:05,252 --> 00:45:21,252
In addition to the primary engagement score as well as things like attrition and retention and There's a lot of factors that we look at around our Workforce but in terms of Engagement specifically, yeah.

257
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:23,552
Three seconds.

258
00:45:28,352 --> 00:45:34,252
I don't have a great answer for the beginning part around engagement, as being the bare minimum, you should expect from your employees.

259
00:45:34,252 --> 00:45:47,552
When I think, Potentially, I mean, so if you think about what we used to measure engagement, it's whether your employees are proud to work there, they would recommend you, they're committed to you, I almost would reverse it and say, I think engagement is the bare minimum.

260
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:52,152
You should expect from your employer that they should be engaging.

261
00:45:52,152 --> 00:45:58,452
You it's at least insofar as you believe that having an Engaged Workforce as a competitive Advantage.

262
00:45:58,552 --> 00:46:20,752
So if you want to be an employee or employer of choice, we go through this work because in we want to act upon aspects of our culture and Experience that drive that in emotional investment, that commitment from your employees, to get all the downstream benefits that we know the increased AR are the reduced turnover, the higher job, performance and productivity.

263
00:46:22,452 --> 00:46:23,052
Thank you.

264
00:46:23,252 --> 00:46:33,552
All right, I am going to squeeze in one question because this one's a good one, but keep it as fast as you can Kim and Bobby its release a hunter with a fully remote team.

265
00:46:33,552 --> 00:46:37,952
How do you cultivate team culture and facilitate staff?

266
00:46:37,952 --> 00:46:44,452
Getting to know each other outside of work focused meetings What does be a short answer?

267
00:46:46,152 --> 00:46:54,452
I think you have to recognize that the team culture is going to happen whether you're paying attention to it or not and that everything you do cultivates, your team culture.

268
00:46:54,452 --> 00:46:59,352
So, it's how you run your meetings is how you assign work, it's how you promote, its how you terminate.

269
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:06,252
It's like that is all culture is not just Gathering Together outside of work focused in meetings.

270
00:47:06,552 --> 00:47:09,552
So your team culture is part of your work, Focus meetings as well.

271
00:47:09,552 --> 00:47:10,752
You can't separate the two.

272
00:47:10,752 --> 00:47:12,552
I think that's first thing that people.

273
00:47:12,952 --> 00:47:17,752
Tends to where they pretend to kind of separate.

274
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:42,052
But in terms of people getting to know each other outside of work, Focus meetings, I think well one of the things we do is Affinity groups on slack and those groups we have a pets group and a parent's group and a we just have we have a new channel called social yell where the Only Rule that you have to type in all caps and it's great for just like shouting because we don't really encourage shouting in all caps in the rest of our Slack.

275
00:47:42,752 --> 00:48:03,052
But creating slack channels and creating opportunities for people to find their people, whether those people are near them or not, and then building in and a suggested mechanisms and letting people take it their way, we suggested something called Loom pen, pals.

276
00:48:03,352 --> 00:48:25,952
It's like you can connect with somebody on the other side of the world and you just send Loom videos back and forth to each other like Uncle pen pals, I am doing things like doughnut, social check, Enzyme just like brand name-dropping now, but people are the other thing to realize is the last thing I will say, is that people are going to experience the social side of Team culture, which I think is what you're talking about here.

277
00:48:25,952 --> 00:48:31,752
Lisa, they're going to want to experience that in different ways depending on how they like to show up at work.

278
00:48:31,752 --> 00:48:33,052
How introverted or extroverted?

279
00:48:33,052 --> 00:48:40,852
They are how passionate they are about their Hobbies, how much time they have to devote to kind of social things, outside of the regular work day.

280
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:54,452
And so not Adding any sort of expectation that every single employee must engage with X number of social chats, otherwise our team culture, sex and kind of removing those expectations and realizing that for some people.

281
00:48:54,752 --> 00:48:55,652
They feel totally.

282
00:48:55,652 --> 00:49:00,252
I am one of these people feeling totally Satisfied by the five minutes of social engagement.

283
00:49:00,252 --> 00:49:05,352
We do at the beginning of our team meetings, where we do a 5-minute social kind of check in with each other.

284
00:49:05,352 --> 00:49:12,552
At the beginning of our meetings, my brain is so busy with two little kids and full-time job and everything else going on in my life.

285
00:49:12,652 --> 00:49:16,752
I feel like I don't at this stage in my life and career, maybe it will be different six months from now.

286
00:49:16,952 --> 00:49:24,752
Like I don't personally feel the need to create extra social opportunities in my workday or outside of my working hours.

287
00:49:24,752 --> 00:49:25,352
Forget about it.

288
00:49:25,352 --> 00:49:29,852
I am like in full-time kid mode but I have like where I am in my life.

289
00:49:29,852 --> 00:49:33,252
I have this kind of cultivation outside of work largely.

290
00:49:33,652 --> 00:49:35,552
So I find ways to do it within my work.

291
00:49:35,752 --> 00:49:39,552
Other people on our team are really looking for that, social connection and are very active.

292
00:49:39,552 --> 00:49:47,252
In our pets channels and are meeting up when Traveling to take their pets on walks with other co-workers.

293
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:54,052
And so just, you really have to be flexible and inclusive of a lot of different styles of socializing.

294
00:49:54,752 --> 00:49:55,452
Love it.

295
00:49:55,652 --> 00:49:56,552
Not a short answer.

296
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,652
Thank you, Bobby.

297
00:50:00,352 --> 00:50:01,152
I agree.

298
00:50:01,552 --> 00:50:09,952
I won't belabor the point by going too much more in-depth but I do think that changing the nature of what that looks like.

299
00:50:10,052 --> 00:50:18,352
Depending on understanding that you have different audiences and abilities to be engaged with some of those outside of work meeting.

300
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:25,252
Social engagements is one of the best things that you can do to get more people involved in outside of work, meeting social engagements.

301
00:50:25,252 --> 00:50:30,952
So, at the beginning of covid, you know, that the virtual happy hours or something with All the Rage.

302
00:50:31,852 --> 00:51:13,852
But recognizing the fact that people who are at home, caregivers, working all day, trying to juggle both things, don't also have the, you know, the next hour or two after to spend, you know, doing a happy hour but recognizing that sometimes in those instances, when those informal connections are made and so standardizing, I think is a great idea, the fact that you're asking the question means that you're hoping to Sigh what that virtual culture looks like and standardizing it ensures that it's not left up to those like really informal, you know, informal Gatherings that some people can and can't make more consistently than others.

303
00:51:14,152 --> 00:51:32,352
For we're actually a lot of like the to take an extreme example where like you know, performance evaluations happen or promotions or made, you know when people are just find that they like each other because they shared a beer together means that I am going to Put you up for that promotion, or I am going to tell you about a career opportunity.

304
00:51:32,352 --> 00:51:40,652
I just saw in a different slack Channel but then not communicate that out more structured or more standardized in a one-on-one or a team meeting.

305
00:51:42,552 --> 00:51:43,252
That's great.

306
00:51:43,252 --> 00:51:44,452
Wow, thank you.

307
00:51:44,552 --> 00:51:46,052
There's so many notes.

308
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:52,352
The recording of This will be shared to everybody, so we're probably going to rewind this and watch some of these Key Parts.

309
00:51:52,352 --> 00:51:53,852
But Kim Bobby.

310
00:51:54,052 --> 00:52:03,552
Thank you so much for sharing your insights with us, your presence alone, just radiates sunshine, and it radiates so much love.

311
00:52:03,552 --> 00:52:05,652

312
00:52:05,652 --> 00:52:09,652
And I feel that our attendees here today are also grateful.

313
00:52:10,052 --> 00:52:11,052
So, thank you so much.

314
00:52:11,052 --> 00:52:17,452
And with that corn Transition into our feng shui experience.

315
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:28,552
So I would like to introduce Suman who is the CEO and co-founder of Marco experiences to the stage and tell us a little bit about Marco.

316
00:52:28,552 --> 00:52:31,552
And you know what, we're going to go into today.

317
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:36,152
Well, I think it's pretty timely with Lisa's question just now actually.

318
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:40,052
And their recent discussion which is an amazing discussion.

319
00:52:40,052 --> 00:52:42,152
So appreciate you facilitating that.

320
00:52:42,552 --> 00:52:45,152
Yeah, so I am assuming I am the CEO and co-founder of Marco.

321
00:52:45,952 --> 00:52:59,052
The problem we're solving is, it was just discussed, which is that the way we work and live, his kind of fundamentally changed, and while we have more flexibility, there's Now new challenges, which is how do I attract and retain the best talent.

322
00:52:59,052 --> 00:53:00,152
How do I create?

323
00:53:00,452 --> 00:53:07,652
Obviously culture is very complicated, but perhaps some of that, social fabric, fabric, around culture, and connection, and that's kind of the problem, we're solving.

324
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:12,152
So we do that through experiences virtual in-person multi-layered.

325
00:53:12,352 --> 00:53:16,352
It's, and then we help proactively kind of plan that partner with companies for that.

We have our product that helps manage kind of employee sentiment and also understanding the ROI of your investment in kind of Employee Engagement or a portion of Employee Engagement.

327
00:53:26,052 --> 00:53:30,152
And so we have our amazing host for the Fung shui experience, but that's kind of what we're solving.

328
00:53:31,052 --> 00:53:33,352
Appreciate you guys having us and feel free to reach out.

I am so delighted to see you all here today.

335
00:54:26,652 --> 00:54:28,152
Thank you so much for joining us.

336
00:54:28,752 --> 00:54:31,252
I wanted to ask you all before.

337
00:54:31,252 --> 00:54:38,152
I tell you all about the wonderful world of funk shui, how many of you have heard of Fung shui?

338
00:54:38,152 --> 00:54:38,852
Right?

339
00:54:38,952 --> 00:54:42,652
How many of you and just put it in the chat?

340
00:54:42,752 --> 00:54:43,352
Tell me.

341
00:54:43,352 --> 00:54:46,252
Yes or now if you have heard a function way.

342
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:48,652
I love that.

343
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:50,752
So Shelly saying yes Danielle.

344
00:54:50,752 --> 00:54:54,652
Yeah, so many people have, and I am So Lisa.

345
00:54:54,652 --> 00:54:56,252
Yes Mindy.

346
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:57,652
Okay, perfect.

347
00:54:58,652 --> 00:55:04,852
So I will tell those of you who might not be familiar with it a little bit about what it is.

348
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:14,552
But I am also going to tell you how I got into function y right, didn't just wake up one day and say, hmm shui.

349
00:55:14,852 --> 00:55:16,952
What I did was it's a little bit.

350
00:55:17,052 --> 00:55:18,852
Long story but it makes sense.

351
00:55:19,252 --> 00:55:28,952
So I worked in the New York City Art world for many years, and I started my own company that helps artists navigate the art world.

352
00:55:29,252 --> 00:55:34,452
And when I started this company, I ended up working out of my kitchen.

353
00:55:34,752 --> 00:55:42,352
I was in this tiny, New York City apartment, and we had a little Nook in the kitchen where I could work.

354
00:55:42,352 --> 00:55:45,052
And here's a picture of the meat in the kitchen.

355
00:55:45,052 --> 00:55:46,852
You see the room divider behind me?

356
00:55:46,952 --> 00:55:49,052
Behind that is like the stove.

357
00:55:50,152 --> 00:55:55,652
It was a true, you know, from the ground up in the kitchen moment.

358
00:55:56,352 --> 00:56:16,852
And when I did this, I Googled Fung shui, I wanted to have everything set up as nicely as possible, and once I really do deep into it, and set it up in a way where I was really activating as much good energy.

359
00:56:17,152 --> 00:56:35,252
Fung shui as possible, my business went full time, I got featured in major Publications and since then, I have been helping so many people work with the principles of feng shui to help them, take their business to the next level.

360
00:56:35,552 --> 00:56:59,652
And while this may not be fully, you know, conventional here in places like Asia, there are major corporations that higher Hire Consultants to double-check and actually guide them on the layout of their offices on the layout, for their Executives and their homes and everything.

361
00:57:00,352 --> 00:57:10,752
So, I wanted to ask you right now, if you could put in the chat, where are you guys working from right now?

362
00:57:11,252 --> 00:57:26,352
And as you could see right, as you could see, I am Not in my kitchen office anymore because the business worked and now I have a beautiful, big office and my desk is on the other side of the room.

363
00:57:26,552 --> 00:57:26,852
Okay.

364
00:57:26,852 --> 00:57:35,952
So we have Tara says, she's working from the kitchen table been there, done that Jenna says, in my or Gina, sorry, my home office.

365
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:37,952
Katie says my kitchen.

366
00:57:39,852 --> 00:57:43,852
Let us see one too, many dogs and husbands and here too.

367
00:57:44,552 --> 00:57:50,952
You know, dogs are actually wonderful for Feng shui because they hang out where the energy is good.

368
00:57:50,952 --> 00:57:56,152
So if you have got dogs hanging out near you this is a good thing.

369
00:57:56,152 --> 00:58:01,052
So we have someone working in their corporate office, which is wonderful.

370
00:58:01,052 --> 00:58:08,852
So if you say the office in San Francisco right by the bay gorgeous, I bet it's beautiful and Kenny says my office.

371
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,052
Chair has a loose screw.

372
00:58:10,052 --> 00:58:13,552
So I have been a victim to a living room and dining room table.

373
00:58:14,052 --> 00:58:14,852
Okay.

374
00:58:14,952 --> 00:58:15,252
All right.

375
00:58:15,252 --> 00:58:16,852
So we have some off.

376
00:58:17,052 --> 00:58:21,552
Says, in some sort of unconventional work from home situations, like Emily.

377
00:58:21,552 --> 00:58:30,552
She's sharing an office / bedroom with her work from home co-workers, who are her husband and her dog, isn't it?

378
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:33,352
Funny how much our dogs are?

379
00:58:33,352 --> 00:58:34,752
Just totally working.

380
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:36,452
Alongside us nowadays.

381
00:58:37,252 --> 00:58:39,452
Also tell me what kind of dog you have?

382
00:58:39,452 --> 00:58:46,652
If you have a dog because I absolutely, I am trying to get my dog to hop on here but I have a little pomeranian dog.

383
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:47,852
Who I would love to say hi to you.

384
00:58:47,852 --> 00:58:50,452
Well and caps.

385
00:58:50,452 --> 00:58:52,052
Yes! Jessica you have a cat.

386
00:58:52,852 --> 00:58:53,252
Okay.

387
00:58:53,252 --> 00:58:53,552
Gosh.

388
00:58:53,552 --> 00:58:55,252
It's a miniature schnauzer.

389
00:58:55,252 --> 00:58:56,152
I love this.

390
00:58:56,252 --> 00:59:09,752
Okay, so when you are working with Feng Shui, so many of you have heard a lot about this, there are three types of luck when it comes to function way, okay?

391
00:59:10,352 --> 00:59:15,452
And the types of lock are as follows, there's the lock that you're born with.

392
00:59:15,452 --> 00:59:22,152
So in our Kind of society, we think of maybe like our Karma or astrology.

393
00:59:22,452 --> 00:59:30,152
So, that's the luck that you're born with, and we can say that the lock that were born with because we live pretty much in the lap of luxury.

394
00:59:30,752 --> 00:59:34,652
I would say compare comparatively, it's pretty good.

395
00:59:34,952 --> 00:59:43,652
And then we have the lock that we create with our hard work and all of you I am sure are working very diligently.

396
00:59:43,852 --> 00:59:48,052
So you can say that you have a lot of luck that you bring in with your hard work.

397
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:52,952
Now the third type of Lock and mind you, all of these are divided evenly.

398
00:59:52,952 --> 00:59:59,152
So it's 1/3 the luck, you're born with 1/3 the luck that you create with your hard work.

399
00:59:59,152 --> 01:00:03,952
And then 1/3 the luck that funk shui brings you.

400
01:00:03,952 --> 01:00:09,552
So the luck that your environment brings you, the flow of energy and your environment.

401
01:00:09,552 --> 01:00:16,752
And so today I am going to share with you three small quick things that you can do too.

402
01:00:17,252 --> 01:00:21,852
Uplevel your space, right?

403
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,752
So let me get into it.

404
01:00:25,652 --> 01:00:28,052
Number one, okay?

405
01:00:28,352 --> 01:00:30,552
Is the power position.

406
01:00:30,552 --> 01:00:33,052
So where you are sitting, okay?

407
01:00:33,352 --> 01:00:39,352
So how many of you are sitting facing the wall where you are?

408
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:43,952
So if you're sitting facing the wall, put a number one in the chat.

409
01:00:44,952 --> 01:00:46,852
Okay, Sonic Christian lore.

410
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:49,052
Dana Caitlin.

411
01:00:49,152 --> 01:00:49,452
Okay.

412
01:00:49,452 --> 01:00:53,652
So many people are sitting facing the wall and you know what?

413
01:00:53,652 --> 01:00:57,452
When I first started I was also sitting facing the wall.

414
01:00:58,152 --> 01:01:07,252
I am going to tell you this really quick trick here and it's actually going to help with your engagement and your company, right?

415
01:01:07,252 --> 01:01:11,052
And it really helps with Employee Engagement because it helps you focus.

416
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:14,452
And that is sitting in the power position.

417
01:01:15,352 --> 01:01:24,152
So when you are sitting in the power position, what happens is you feel more powerful, you feel more focused.

418
01:01:24,252 --> 01:01:26,752
So you're asking me Marina, what is this power position?

419
01:01:26,752 --> 01:01:29,152
You're talking about, how do we get there?

420
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:44,552
So there is might have some illustrations pop up on the screen for you but basically when you are sitting not facing the wall and you have the door in sight so you're not sitting.

421
01:01:44,652 --> 01:02:02,652
Right in front of the door, we're going to have some not right, power positions but when you are sitting with the facing a wall or where you see the door, right, you're not directly in front of the door, but you see and it's not to the site side.

422
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:08,652
So Lori says, dead center of the room that's actually wonderful as long as you can see the door.

423
01:02:08,952 --> 01:02:16,752
And the reason for this is a little bit psychological but it's also very powerful when it comes to function way.

424
01:02:17,452 --> 01:02:23,052
So punctual actually goes back, many, many centuries, thousands of years actually.

425
01:02:23,352 --> 01:02:32,452
And originally, it was to find the right land, formations to bury Emperor's and China, a little Macabre.

426
01:02:32,452 --> 01:02:44,452
But today, it has evolved into amplifying, the lock, right in your life, in your relationships, and your health, and your business.

427
01:02:44,852 --> 01:02:54,752
And so when you are thinking about your space, think of yourself as the royalty in your home, okay?

428
01:02:55,252 --> 01:03:03,852
So if you are the Royal person in your home, whether you're the king, the queen Emperor, the empress or whatever, right?

429
01:03:03,952 --> 01:03:05,652
When you are doing that.

430
01:03:06,852 --> 01:03:16,652
You are in a power position and that Royal person would never sit in a way so that they do not see the door.

431
01:03:17,152 --> 01:03:20,452
What a king ever sit with their back to the door.

432
01:03:20,652 --> 01:03:28,452
If you think about it in movies, villains always sit with their back to the door and what happens to them, right?

433
01:03:28,452 --> 01:03:29,052
Okay.

434
01:03:29,152 --> 01:03:36,452
So we have someone's who's sitting facing so pakalana says she's facing the window.

435
01:03:36,552 --> 01:03:37,652
A door behind me.

436
01:03:38,052 --> 01:03:44,152
So I know it's beautiful to look at the window and it's actually great lighting to sit facing out the window.

437
01:03:44,552 --> 01:03:57,652
But, you know, when you're in Zoom but you really, when you are sitting there and you see the door, you, you are fully focused because let me show you what happens when you're not in a power position.

438
01:03:57,652 --> 01:04:18,952
So if we show you these illustrations, where you're sitting with your back to the door, what happens is you are on high alert and there is You know, your lizard brain your amygdala and no matter how safe you feel in your space, you are going to feel that in your subconscious.

439
01:04:18,952 --> 01:04:26,552
You're going to have these processes that are taking away your focus because they're going to be asking, hey, who's going to walk in?

440
01:04:26,552 --> 01:04:32,852
What if somebody walks into the door and it has nothing to do with how safe you feel in the space.

441
01:04:32,852 --> 01:04:38,852
It's truly something that is very Much instinctive and primitive and us.

442
01:04:39,052 --> 01:04:49,652
So when you sit with the Dorn site, it's so much better for you and when if you're interested and you know, I do these Marco experiences.

443
01:04:50,452 --> 01:04:56,752
When I do these Marco experiences, they're a little bit more intimate, right?

444
01:04:56,752 --> 01:04:59,452
We have, I could see where you're sitting.

445
01:04:59,452 --> 01:05:01,552
I could see your camera on.

446
01:05:01,852 --> 01:05:10,252
If you choose to show me that and in these Marco experiences, not only do I tell you, you know, all of these things.

447
01:05:10,252 --> 01:05:15,952
I also tell you what, your luckiest direction is for sitting and facing.

448
01:05:15,952 --> 01:05:26,852
And in the past, I have done this to one of my clients, my one-on-one punctuated clients, and she just got a new her.

449
01:05:26,852 --> 01:05:33,852
She worked for a real-estate company firm, and she was a realtor, and they just got a new office.

450
01:05:33,852 --> 01:05:35,652
And she asked me, Marina, where do I?

451
01:05:35,652 --> 01:05:36,252
Sit I can.

452
01:05:36,652 --> 01:05:44,852
And nice eat and not only did I pick a good seat for her so that she's in a power position.

453
01:05:44,952 --> 01:06:01,852
She was also facing one of her, lucky directions, and instantly, literally like the next day, somebody walked in off the street, and she made a huge million-dollar-plus sale in cash, instantly, right?

454
01:06:02,452 --> 01:06:05,852
Because that is how this stuff works.

455
01:06:05,852 --> 01:06:10,552
So if you're Interested to know what your true power position is.

456
01:06:10,852 --> 01:06:22,052
It would be really good if you booked it Marco experience, because then I could look at your space and tell you specifically where to sit and how to face.

457
01:06:22,452 --> 01:06:30,252
So, and I see, company says, window on wall closet, opposite wall, and the doors in a corner.

458
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:34,152
So, if you face the window, you are definitely with your back to the door.

459
01:06:34,552 --> 01:06:42,252
Yes, there is a Way, no matter how small your space is, my kitchen area, was Tiny.

460
01:06:43,052 --> 01:07:00,152
And I actually had maybe one want to say like two feet ahead of me because I insisted on sitting with my back to the wall and facing the entrance and seeing the entrance.

461
01:07:01,052 --> 01:07:13,752
So if you remember that promo shot in the very beginning where I have my diploma, Has with me that was in my kitchen office and I thought you could never tell because it was so nicely set up.

462
01:07:14,952 --> 01:07:17,552
It was like the previous promo shot.

463
01:07:17,752 --> 01:07:28,552
But anyway, so, before we go on, I just want to say it's also really important for you to have a chair that gives you support.

464
01:07:28,852 --> 01:07:39,252
So if you have a chair that has a higher back, the higher, the chair back the better, it is because A, if you are the royalty, you need a throne.

465
01:07:39,552 --> 01:07:46,852
So somebody earlier said that they had they were victim into the living room or the dining room.

466
01:07:46,852 --> 01:07:49,752
I can't remember because they had a screw loose on their chair.

467
01:07:50,152 --> 01:08:01,152
Make sure that your furniture is not wobbly and not loose because that gives you really, really good support, okay?

468
01:08:01,352 --> 01:08:05,652
And Kim is asking, are any tips on counteracting bad feng shui?

469
01:08:05,652 --> 01:08:12,152
If For example, you can't change the location of your desk or get a new chair.

470
01:08:12,552 --> 01:08:15,452
So yes and actually that's the third tips.

471
01:08:15,452 --> 01:08:27,952
I am going to go to it but generally speaking when you work with a practitioner what they can do is they can sort of fix this situation for you by carefully.

472
01:08:27,952 --> 01:08:35,452
Placing a mirror so that you do see the entrance from your desk, you just have to be very careful when you place this mirror.

473
01:08:36,452 --> 01:08:40,051
Cause you don't want to bounce the money energy back out.

474
01:08:40,051 --> 01:08:44,152
So that brings me to my next tip which is me replacement right here.

475
01:08:44,551 --> 01:08:51,952
So this I thought was so important to share with you Sonia.

476
01:08:51,952 --> 01:08:52,551
I love that.

477
01:08:52,551 --> 01:08:57,051
You say that you have to hide all the wires and that's why you face the wall.

478
01:08:58,452 --> 01:08:59,352
Here's the thing.

479
01:08:59,352 --> 01:09:06,252
When you were sitting with your back to the wall, first of all, you can put the wires in a box or something like that.

480
01:09:06,452 --> 01:09:12,452
When you're sitting with your back to the wall and you see your whole space in front of you, you will feel so much more powerful.

481
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:16,952
You will feel so much more open and more motivated to doing your work.

482
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:18,152
So give it a whirl.

483
01:09:18,652 --> 01:09:26,652
So back to me replacement, I thought this was super important to share with you because I actually had someone who hired me.

484
01:09:26,652 --> 01:09:32,952
They couldn't find a job for like a year and it was terrible in the moment that I walk into their space.

485
01:09:33,152 --> 01:09:36,252
I see a long hallway and at the end of the hallway, there's a mirror.

486
01:09:36,352 --> 01:09:41,452
And that mirror, what it was doing, it was reflecting all the energy back out the front door.

487
01:09:41,652 --> 01:09:53,051
So mirrors, actually double the energy, and they double the, the they double and direct the energy.

488
01:09:53,051 --> 01:10:00,552
So, here we have some illustrations of how you should Place mirror, so that they're not reflecting the door.

489
01:10:00,552 --> 01:10:15,052
And so you see those two on top, it's really good to have a mirror in your dining room because it actually doubles the energy of food and people and abundance, right?

490
01:10:15,052 --> 01:10:19,552
And in your workspace if you have a mirror that's adjacent to the door.

491
01:10:19,552 --> 01:10:24,952
So, if the mirrors shares a wall with the door, right?

492
01:10:26,252 --> 01:10:36,252
It's actually really good for you because it will double the energy that comes in and it also doubles the energy you have, right?

493
01:10:37,052 --> 01:10:39,452
So why am is asking me here?

494
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:40,252
Can a mirror?

495
01:10:40,252 --> 01:10:42,052
Reflect window?

496
01:10:42,952 --> 01:10:44,552
Yes, it can.

497
01:10:44,652 --> 01:10:49,752
You just want to make sure that it's not fully in front of the window?

498
01:10:49,752 --> 01:10:57,052
It's a little bit off to the side so it's not fully lined up with the window but it's not the end of the world.

499
01:10:57,152 --> 01:11:10,652
If it is most important thing is that it doesn't reflect the front door not opposite a doorway that it's not at the end of Long hallway and it's not reflecting a toilet.

500
01:11:11,052 --> 01:11:11,652
Okay.

501
01:11:11,652 --> 01:11:13,152
So a lot of us have a mirror.

502
01:11:13,152 --> 01:11:14,652
Right outside, the bathroom.

503
01:11:14,952 --> 01:11:18,152
You don't need that mirror.

504
01:11:18,152 --> 01:11:18,952
There move it.

505
01:11:18,952 --> 01:11:22,652
So it doesn't reflect the door.

506
01:11:23,652 --> 01:11:27,752
So and I have so many good questions in the chat that I really want to answer.

507
01:11:27,752 --> 01:11:35,152
Maybe we can open up a lounge after and I can get to it and use of the saying, how about facing?

508
01:11:35,752 --> 01:11:36,052
Yes.

509
01:11:36,052 --> 01:11:36,352
We will get.

510
01:11:36,452 --> 01:11:39,352
Get to those questions later, they're so good.

511
01:11:39,852 --> 01:11:50,152
So when I do a Marco experience because you can have your camera on, I can really guide you when it comes to the mirror placement.

512
01:11:50,252 --> 01:12:03,752
So if you are really, really curious about how you're sitting or what your mirror placement as that is one way that I can help you really pinpoint this right now.

513
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:12,952
The final thing that I want to share with you today Is called a salt cure and before we bring it up on the screen, or okay, we will make it up on the screen.

514
01:12:13,652 --> 01:12:15,552
I want to tell you what this is for.

515
01:12:15,952 --> 01:12:29,152
So when I practice Fung shui, I practice classical Chinese Funk shui and you're actually going to see if you Google Fung shui, there's a very generalized layout of every space.

516
01:12:29,152 --> 01:12:36,052
It's called a bagua and it's incorrect because it's too General, right?

517
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:48,852
So when you place a salt cure, it's something that classical Chinese feng shui practitioners often do because they take away the negative energy in a room.

518
01:12:48,852 --> 01:12:53,552
How many of you walked into a room and felt like it was icky, right?

519
01:12:53,552 --> 01:12:59,152
Just put a 1 in the chat if you felt into a room or space in your like oh okay.

520
01:12:59,152 --> 01:13:01,052
So many people are missing one good.

521
01:13:01,552 --> 01:13:12,452
So what you do is you put together this glass, Jar with Nolan with a wide neck and this would be a salt cure.

522
01:13:12,452 --> 01:13:21,752
So, look at this illustration here, you're going to fill it up about 70% with salt right?

523
01:13:21,752 --> 01:13:28,652
And has to be just salt, not, you know, Jane's, crazy salt mix, right with all the other stuff in it.

524
01:13:28,852 --> 01:13:30,452
So fill it up with salt.

525
01:13:30,552 --> 01:13:36,352
Put 6 coins in a circle around it, then put it on 90%.

526
01:13:37,352 --> 01:13:51,752
Put fill it up, 90% with water so it doesn't touch the top against a little bit open and you want to put it on a platform that you can just toss out later because what this salt cure is going to do, it's going to crystallize.

527
01:13:51,752 --> 01:13:56,552
How many of you remember the science project without the coins, right?

528
01:13:56,552 --> 01:14:01,252
Like how many of you remember doing something like this and science class?

529
01:14:01,252 --> 01:14:02,452
Yes, Amanda.

530
01:14:02,452 --> 01:14:10,652
I knew somebody would because I sure did so You do this, you're going to leave this in a corner of the room.

531
01:14:10,652 --> 01:14:11,452
You're going to let it breathe.

532
01:14:11,452 --> 01:14:19,452
You can put it on top of the bookshelf, so it's out of you and you're going to let it crystallized and make sure it's like on a magazine or something.

533
01:14:19,452 --> 01:14:25,652
So that it, you know, when the salt crusts up, you could just take the whole magazine and throw it out.

534
01:14:25,652 --> 01:14:43,352
As a matter of fact, you have just put a plastic paper bag, over your hand, grab it and toss it out because it will have so much negative energy in it, then it will suck out from the room and it will actually make the room feel better.

535
01:14:43,652 --> 01:14:58,152
I have done this in, you know, full disclosure, I have friends who were bickering and I said to my friend, I was like, you need to put a salt cure in your bedroom just right now.

536
01:14:58,152 --> 01:15:03,252
And so she did this and her husband stop bickering, which was great.

537
01:15:03,352 --> 01:15:10,452
So how often do you have to do this natyam I would say do this at the very minimum, right?

538
01:15:10,452 --> 01:15:15,652
I mean, if you're going to be really intense about it, you could do it every month or whenever you feel weird.

539
01:15:16,052 --> 01:15:20,952
I would say just do it once when you move into a place, right?

540
01:15:20,952 --> 01:15:32,252
Or you could even do it once a year, but the energy and Funk shui, it, changes annually, monthly daily hourly, right?

541
01:15:32,452 --> 01:15:36,252
The salt cure takes a really long time to cry.

542
01:15:36,352 --> 01:15:39,252
Sometimes Crystallized it will crystallize into days.

543
01:15:39,252 --> 01:15:44,252
Sometimes it will take two weeks, depends on how much energy is in there.

544
01:15:44,952 --> 01:15:57,552
So make sure most important thing is that you keep the lid off and you do not touch it when you toss it out and ym is asking, do you need to do the salt cure?

545
01:15:57,552 --> 01:15:58,252
Peru more?

546
01:15:58,252 --> 01:15:58,652
Is it okay?

547
01:15:58,652 --> 01:16:00,852
For the whole home, right?

548
01:16:00,952 --> 01:16:02,952
It depends on the layout of your home.

549
01:16:04,052 --> 01:16:14,352
If just to be fully safe, Do it for the rooms where you spend the most time and especially in the center of the home this year.

550
01:16:14,352 --> 01:16:27,752
Especially if you have like an open floor plan in the center of your home is fully open because the energy those here in the center is not so good, it's actually more energy.

551
01:16:27,752 --> 01:16:32,052
So it's kind of interesting that there's a war happening this year, like a big one.

552
01:16:32,952 --> 01:16:36,452
But anyway, we don't need to get into that right now.

553
01:16:36,652 --> 01:16:38,752

Oh, is my camera glitching?

3
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:51,803

4
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:53,403

00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:01,303

9
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:03,803
We are so excited about today's event.

10
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:04,903
Thank you, Thomas.

11
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:08,303
I love the thumbs UPS, appreciate it.

12
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:12,203
And it looks like we have got folks tuning in from all over.

13
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:19,502
I am actually here in Honolulu Hawaii and it is 7 AM in the morning.

14
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:21,303
So It's nice to see.

15
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:29,703
We got folks in Toronto, Thomas you're at NYC Morgan, Seattle, Houston, Oregon all over.

16
00:17:30,003 --> 00:17:31,703
Aloha everyone.

17
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:33,903
It's lovely to have you here.

18
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:38,303
And our topic today is a really special one.

19
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:45,103
It's about the power of purpose and how you can foster a greater sense of purpose with your employee.

20
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:48,503
So I am really excited about our guest today.

21
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:52,803
Her name is Olivia, He is the VP of partner, success, with d.

22
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:58,203
Before I bring her up, we wanted to do a quick little housekeeping check.

23
00:17:58,303 --> 00:18:15,103
So note that we have a Q&A Tab and at any given moment, feel free to drop your questions in that Tab and towards the end of this event will probably pull in some of those questions and answer them for you with Olivia here.

24
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:20,703
There's also a help tab, so if you're trying to navigate the platform you're here on, welcome to Day.

25
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:24,203
And if you have questions, feel free to drop them in there.

26
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:28,703
Now, let us kick off with a quick poll.

27
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:38,403
Have you participated in any giving activities, virtual volunteering donations?

28
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:48,003
Both or not yet, feel free to start dropping in your votes there, and we will quickly be able to see oh, okay, both.

29
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:59,803
Alright, so some of you have participated in Virtual volunteering and donations, refining trend-wise, we're hearing that more folks in the last couple.

30
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:06,803
Years have actually been doing donations over virtual volunteering Olivia will give us more points on that to come.

31
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:29,703
So with that, you know, today's Workforce is looking for that common greater purpose and according to Deloitte 67 percent of employees, look for socially responsible companies and companies who meet that need are seeing at least a 40 percent Spike.

32
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:30,903
In retention.

33
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:38,303
So I am asking the question, we're all asking the questions, how can we build a community that helps our employees gain?

34
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,003
This greater sense of purpose.

35
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:42,803
Meaning belonging fulfillment at work.

36
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:49,003
So with that, I love to bring to the stage Olivia VP of partner success at deed.

37
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:50,403
Hello.

38
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:51,403
Hello.

39
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:52,203
Hi Jenna.

40
00:19:52,203 --> 00:19:54,003
Thank you so much for having me.

41
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:55,603
Absolutely.

42
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:57,403
It's great to see you.

43
00:19:57,803 --> 00:19:59,803
And where are you tuning in from?

44
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:02,803
I am in Park City Utah.

45
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:07,103
So not quite as tropical as Hawaii.

46
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:08,803
But pretty dang good.

47
00:20:08,803 --> 00:20:12,403
We got the mountains and some good Sunshine, so not complaining.

48
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:14,003
That's awesome.

49
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:16,003
You taught is beautiful.

50
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:19,603
So is it and it's good for you there?

51
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:33,303
I promised I would try to bring my coworker so hopefully that's Just a good kickoff wheat.

52
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:34,703
7 AM morning.

53
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:36,303
Thank you.

54
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:38,603
What's your co-workers name is?

55
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:39,703
Name is daily.

56
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:46,803
So daily you think he's gonna behave himself during our conversation but if not we will just see what he has to say.

57
00:20:48,703 --> 00:21:02,403
Awesome, well, he's welcome to participate and if he's got a question, feel free to bring him on any given point, and we well yeah, I like xandria we id'd we have Frou-frou dog, and cat.

58
00:21:02,403 --> 00:21:03,603
Really, any animal.

59
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:06,403
It's the role that if they're in the room, they have to be on the video.

60
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:10,303
So we love it to love that.

61
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:19,103
Alright, so Olivia, we saw this, the stats that came through a lot of folks participated in donations.

62
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:28,603
And there's some, a good amount of folks that also did both virtual volunteering and donations, just talking quickly about what you're seeing with the trends.

63
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:33,803
And, you know, you had mentioned to me that donations are a lot more.

64
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,703
Those are taking place more than virtual volunteering.

65
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:38,003
Can you speak to that a little bit?

66
00:21:38,303 --> 00:21:51,403
Yeah, I mean obviously we have all lived it the past two years have been insane for so many reasons, but in the giving an impact Community, it's certainly been interesting to see.

67
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:59,203
I mean, obviously at the very beginning and even into the past couple months, folks really have moved away from volunteering.

68
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:15,603
Just certainly hard for nonprofits, like soup kitchens or like tutoring programs are doing a lot of things in person, but it has opened up the opportunity for more virtual volunteering and some more skills-based volunteering, which is super cool and exciting.

69
00:22:15,803 --> 00:22:22,903
And then the other though, like really big push that we have seen is just through donations and so much generosity over the past couple of years.

70
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:29,303
I mean, starting with covid but you know, most recently we have seen a lot of help going towards Ukraine.

71
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:42,403
And like most recently, some things with gun violence and so people kind of putting their money where their mouth is over the past couple years because they weren't able to do it in person or hands on Gotcha, that's really interesting.

72
00:22:42,603 --> 00:22:51,603
So I am going to take us back a few notches and elevation up here because we are talking about social impact Corporate social responsibility.

73
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:56,603
And, you know, there are some stats that we just read off that, obviously, make it important.

74
00:22:56,603 --> 00:23:03,903
But I would love to hear from your perspective, considering the changes are taking place with work remote hybrid.

75
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:05,103
All of these things?

76
00:23:05,903 --> 00:23:25,903
Why is social impact so important for companies to be considering Yeah, such a good question and I feel like we could just talk about that all day, but I think for me, there's kind of and for deed, there's like two different parts that we think about one is like really on the impact component.

77
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:28,403
And I have seen some folks and some folks that I know from the nonprofit.

78
00:23:28,403 --> 00:23:40,403
So they know this even better is like when you have Collective impact, you can do so much more good and that goes for volunteering or donations, when you like getting more brains in the room, more ideas floating around.

79
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:40,803
Around.

80
00:23:40,803 --> 00:23:44,903
If like you need to help a non-profit with a marketing campaign, like that's always going to be better.

81
00:23:44,903 --> 00:23:50,603
And then obviously with donations, the more people that you have contributing, the more matching, you have four more companies.

82
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:58,903
The more you're able to do so it's just like better for your local community and our communities at large.

83
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:08,003
But then the other side that we have seen, which like companies like Deloitte have awesome stats around, it is really around retention recruitment.

84
00:24:08,003 --> 00:24:10,003
Fulfillment at work.

85
00:24:10,603 --> 00:24:26,403
Like being able to keep people in their jobs, I think especially with like the millennial generation and then gen Z is now entering the workforce, and we have seen those Generations caring about this even more especially when it comes to their job.

86
00:24:26,403 --> 00:24:31,603
So they're like, you know, we don't want to work for a company that doesn't stand for the similar things that we stand for.

87
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:36,003
And, so, in that way, it's really important to like, HR teams.

88
00:24:36,003 --> 00:24:42,703
People team to really, make sure that impact is built into what the He's doing mmm.

89
00:24:43,403 --> 00:24:56,603
And as far as trends that you're seeing of do's and do Nots as companies start to get more intentional about pulling social impact into their business strategies.

90
00:24:57,503 --> 00:24:59,403
What are some dues do?

91
00:24:59,403 --> 00:25:01,203
Not yeah.

92
00:25:01,403 --> 00:25:02,003
Good.

93
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:02,903
Good question.

94
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:10,003
So, well, first of all, maybe I can give to like a little bit of a little brief about deed because I think that will help you.

95
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:10,203
Yes.

96
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:12,303
Why we hear about this?

97
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,703
And because this is what we're doing on a day-to-day basis.

98
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:17,703
So deed is a social impact platform.

99
00:25:17,703 --> 00:25:24,003
We connect nonprofits companies and employees and really help them do good.

100
00:25:24,503 --> 00:25:29,203
And then, when once, and while all that goat is happening, we track all of it.

101
00:25:29,203 --> 00:25:32,103
So on the admin side, you can see all the good that's happening.

102
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:40,103
And so we get to work with all the teams that are driving that to come up with really cool, creative ideas for how to launch that, how to push it out.

103
00:25:40,303 --> 00:25:42,603
How to get people more engaged.

104
00:25:42,903 --> 00:25:52,303
And so that's kind of why we see some of these Trends and where things are going and know a little bit more about like the best practices in this impact community.

105
00:25:53,803 --> 00:26:04,103
And I would say, we talked about kind of like that shift to donations, but I think that in a broader sense is just about being agile, you know, three years ago.

106
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:10,203
You potentially could have had a program that was like, we're 40% in person volunteering.

107
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,303
Virtual and 40% donations.

108
00:26:12,603 --> 00:26:29,903
And you know once the pandemic happened that would have totally gotten blown up, and so we always talk about like how can you be super proactive and say like these are the things that our company really cares about and stands for but then also build into your program like how can I be reactive?

109
00:26:29,903 --> 00:26:36,403
Because you can never plan, you know, disaster relief or like I mentioned gun control.

110
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:48,103
Lots of folks are talking about that, you know, hurricanes Earthquakes like those you know, God forbid moment that have to happen and so being able to build kind of that agility into it.

111
00:26:48,403 --> 00:26:50,403
I think is super important.

112
00:26:51,703 --> 00:27:06,403
And then in terms of like where we kind of see things going, they talk like we talked a lot about employees having voice and choice but also companies being able to be super intentional with we're like they're matching dollars or going.

113
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:09,303
So something that I think has been super cool.

114
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:09,903
Is that?

115
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:19,003
Companies are kind of like narrowing down on the nonprofits and organizations that they want to support because it's something that like really aligns to their business.

116
00:27:19,003 --> 00:27:23,903
So like banks, for example, I have seen them do a lot of cool stuff with financial literacy.

117
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:32,103
We work with Airbnb who such an incredible company, and they do so much with impact, but because they're in housing, they can do a lot with refugees.

118
00:27:32,303 --> 00:27:38,103
And with like after disaster relief, they are always there to help another company sonder.

119
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:39,303
It does the same thing.

120
00:27:40,303 --> 00:27:46,503
Like Adidas is another one of our wonderful companies, and they like work very specifically with sports-related nonprofit.

121
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:55,503
And so, in terms of like a trend, I feel like just getting a little bit deeper and more intentional with like what you as a company really cares about.

122
00:27:55,903 --> 00:28:03,303
I think is what we're going to see things going, but also allowing your employees to feel like their voices heard to.

123
00:28:03,303 --> 00:28:09,903
So, potentially you have like an open program for General matching, but you give to X2 sports-related nonprofits.

124
00:28:09,903 --> 00:28:11,303
If your A sport.

125
00:28:11,503 --> 00:28:12,503
Ah, gotcha.

126
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:14,103
Interesting.

127
00:28:14,803 --> 00:28:24,903
So the strategy you basically want to provide opportunity, multiple opportunities of how an employee can participate and get involved.

128
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,203
Yeah, 100%.

129
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:33,503
I mean, I think if you're able the, the wonderful thing that I love about deed is that were able to work with all types of companies.

130
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:39,603
So super small and then also really, really big Fortune 50 companies.

131
00:28:39,803 --> 00:29:04,803
And so it's going to look a little bit different, like the smaller companies just might not have as many resources but there's a lot of ways that you can still direct and support your employees and giving but 100% I think you said it better than I ever could like giving lots of opportunities for your employees to give back and then like particularly highlighting the stuff that you have as a company care about, I think is an awesome way to pair the two.

132
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:10,703
So let us pull that thread a little bit for Shins.

133
00:29:10,703 --> 00:29:21,003
That may just be starting to figure out what is the right nonprofit to be a part of, you know, where do we donate to?

134
00:29:21,603 --> 00:29:23,103
What is a good starting point?

135
00:29:23,903 --> 00:29:31,403
How do they you have talked about super powers before helping, you know, organizations identify what that looks like?

136
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,103
Could you speak to a little bit about that?

137
00:29:33,403 --> 00:29:34,403
Yes, 100%.

138
00:29:34,403 --> 00:29:44,903
So that I would say is like one of our favorite things to help companies do is it so exciting when a program is just Starting it feels like the world is your oyster but it also I think can be pretty intimidating.

139
00:29:44,903 --> 00:29:47,803
It's like we could literally do anything so what do we do?

140
00:29:49,103 --> 00:30:01,003
And so yes, we talked a lot about this idea of the superpower and it's basically like what does your company do better than anybody else or really different from anybody else?

141
00:30:01,203 --> 00:30:05,003
And how can you harness it to for good?

142
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:09,303
And so we usually talk about like three different steps for it.

143
00:30:09,503 --> 00:30:23,803
One And this is generally for companies who are just starting out, but also could be if you're looking to Pivot a little bit more or even just to like realign your social impact mission and vision and how that's playing out.

144
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:30,403
So the first thing would just be like thinking about your company's social impact Mission, like, what are you trying to change?

145
00:30:30,403 --> 00:30:32,703
What do you really care about as a company?

146
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:39,503
And we went about this before, but, like, obviously, extra bonus points if it's also what a lot of your employees care about.

147
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:46,503
That's why I think, Like the bank example is really cool, is obviously folks who are very entrenched in this like Financial world.

148
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:55,303
And so financial literacy, I have seen be a really cool cause because a lot of those folks really care about that and are super knowledgeable.

149
00:30:55,303 --> 00:31:09,403
So like understanding what your social impact mission is obviously ensuring all the execs are bought in bonus, if all the employees are super Baden and this kind of like anchors, what your superpower is for?

150
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:10,103
Like what are you trying to?

151
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:11,203
Change what you try to do?

152
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:16,803
And then the next one would be identifying your company's actual superpower.

153
00:31:16,903 --> 00:31:30,103
So I actually already gave some examples, you know, with companies that we have worked with, but Deeds, I think is more around our platform and, you know, our platform connects people.

154
00:31:30,103 --> 00:31:35,903
So we connect nonprofits company's employees and so that platform allows people to do good.

155
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:46,603
And, so I would say our platform is our super power, but for different people, you know, A Consulting Group like their people would be their superpower and that, you know, they can help nonprofits, do all sorts of different things.

156
00:31:47,103 --> 00:31:57,003
So it could be your people, your product, really anything, and so you want to identify that and so once you have it designs defied, your kind of like Mission and then your superpower.

157
00:31:57,203 --> 00:32:06,603
Then it's really putting it into action, which is obviously the hard part, but it's really collaborating across the board employees Executives.

158
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:10,103
Pulling in employee resource groups, your local community.

159
00:32:11,303 --> 00:32:15,503
So that they, you know, so that you can leverage your superpower in service of your mission.

160
00:32:15,503 --> 00:32:18,503
So hopefully that helps a little bit in terms of like a 1-2-3.

161
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:27,403
If there's anybody who's just starting out or you're chatting with somebody who's just starting out, we like think a lot about your superpower and how you can use that for good.

162
00:32:28,903 --> 00:32:29,603
That's good.

163
00:32:30,503 --> 00:32:34,403
Yeah, so we got a note here from makinen.

164
00:32:34,403 --> 00:32:42,003
We also love seeing the trend of new startups, and companies, building an impact from day, one really baking this into their model.

165
00:32:42,603 --> 00:32:50,403
I think that's also key and, you know, talking about you and I were talking about this in the Green Room a little bit ago, right before the event.

166
00:32:51,003 --> 00:33:10,203
But as far as looking at the employee journey in total, obviously we know the first 30, 60 90 days of really He for any new hire to fully get integrated with the culture and it would make sense to introduce the social impact causes and how to participate all that in those days.

167
00:33:10,203 --> 00:33:14,703
But where would you advise to get employees?

168
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:18,403
Really involved of corporate responsibility.

169
00:33:18,903 --> 00:33:19,703
Such a good question.

170
00:33:19,703 --> 00:33:22,103
So I would say there're two places.

171
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:34,603
I mean one, I have seen people do it in the interview process like, you know, you can just add, depending on maybe It's like a man manager question or even like appear interview which I think folks usually do that.

172
00:33:34,603 --> 00:33:35,003
It's something.

173
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:39,103
Just like what's your favorite cause like is there any nonprofits that you're working with?

174
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:44,903
Like we particularly focus on education like is that something that you care about?

175
00:33:44,903 --> 00:34:05,603
Like you can truly bake it in and that way if nothing else just so that the folks know that's something that you really, really care about but that, in terms of like when they're actually hired on, we have seen a lot of our companies, they Have like a slide about deed a slide about the IMPACT program, a slide about the policies during the onboarding process.

176
00:34:05,603 --> 00:34:15,003
So you know all companies do it a little bit differently but most companies do have an onboarding process, and they just have that as part of it and you introduce everything.

177
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:20,503
Some folks you know have like a seminar for all new hires that week or that month.

178
00:34:20,703 --> 00:34:26,003
And so we have seen people like do those presentations then and then I really loved it too.

179
00:34:26,503 --> 00:34:37,003
I did we call it new higher credit but It could look different and every client or company, but they give new hires $25 to spend on Deed from.

180
00:34:37,003 --> 00:34:37,803
That's cool.

181
00:34:38,103 --> 00:34:38,603
Yeah.

182
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:43,003
And so that's awesome because it also was like here's the platform we use.

183
00:34:43,003 --> 00:34:44,103
Here's what we care about.

184
00:34:44,103 --> 00:34:45,103
Here's our policies.

185
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:47,303
This is what it looks like and now go use it.

186
00:34:47,303 --> 00:34:51,303
And so then it allows the personal log on to deed spend that credit they know.

187
00:34:51,303 --> 00:34:58,503
The company is truly investing in that, and then they get to send some money to their favorite nonprofit.

188
00:34:58,503 --> 00:35:01,003
So, It's definitely a win-win that's good.

189
00:35:01,003 --> 00:35:09,603
So I am even as early as the interview process, you're introducing the company's involvement and then especially that onboarding process.

190
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:17,803
What about for employees that have been with the company for one year plus, how do you get them engaged?

191
00:35:18,103 --> 00:35:26,103
Yeah, really, really good question but I think that is really one like the bottoms-up approach is super important.

192
00:35:26,803 --> 00:35:28,303
I mean, and that's kind of buzzword.

193
00:35:28,303 --> 00:35:30,203
I feel like it Point, but I have seen lots of folks.

194
00:35:30,203 --> 00:35:38,103
Do like listening tours, where they go around and say, hey what have you really enjoyed that we have done with social impact, could be pre or post pandemic?

195
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,803
Like what do you feel like is missing?

196
00:35:39,903 --> 00:35:40,303
Are there?

197
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:44,103
Some nonprofit say you'd love to nominate how our different things working.

198
00:35:44,103 --> 00:35:51,503
So I think just like making people feel like their part of the process in the decision-making and then also just like identifying communities.

199
00:35:51,503 --> 00:35:53,903
That would be really excited to participate.

200
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:58,003
So we often times see, ER, G's employee resources resource groups.

201
00:35:58,003 --> 00:36:09,403
It's sometimes called A little bit different at different companies, but those groups often times really focus in on specific causes like speaking as a woman I can say like women at deed.

202
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:18,003
That's like a group that we would probably focus on supporting women-led nonprofits or nonprofits supporting women in different communities.

203
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:23,803
And so you can really lean into kind of those like cause specific organizations.

204
00:36:24,703 --> 00:36:56,103
We have seen lots of different things, you know, depending on how dispersed your Is having like, Regional ambassadors, who were super pumped about giving back and, like, the culture of giving at your company and so having, you know, almost like satellite or like remote groups that are specified for giving or talk about giving her to help like lead, local activations is also, I think a great way for folks who might have been involved for a while and maybe like haven't done anything during the pandemic or like looking to get more involved.

205
00:36:57,203 --> 00:36:58,703
But yeah, lots of like different.

206
00:36:58,803 --> 00:36:59,403
Fun ideas.

207
00:36:59,403 --> 00:37:01,803
I am sure some of those will come up more later too.

208
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,703
That's great.

209
00:37:03,903 --> 00:37:07,803
And if anybody has questions, feel free to drop them in Q&A.

210
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:11,103
And we will I am we're looking at that as well.

211
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:30,503
So, one of the things, Olivia, you mentioned was leadership and you'd say the top down the bottom up approach, But ultimately, we all know that it needs to start from the top and so that executive buy-in, like how can you speak to a little bit about what?

212
00:37:30,503 --> 00:37:32,003
You know what you have seen?

213
00:37:32,903 --> 00:37:36,803
With leaders that are involved leadership, that's not involved.

214
00:37:37,203 --> 00:37:48,203
What if there's a company out there right now where the leaders may not be fully involved in aware and there's an employee that wants to get the leadership more involved.

215
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:49,703
So there're different scenarios here.

216
00:37:49,703 --> 00:37:50,803
But can you speak to that?

217
00:37:50,803 --> 00:37:53,703
Significance of the leadership teams of all?

218
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:54,103
Yeah.

219
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:57,103
100%, it's such a, such a good point.

220
00:37:57,103 --> 00:38:14,903
And so, so important like I mean, Jenna, you mentioned, like, it just is not going to stick fully if It's if the leadership is not bought in and so that's why you know, we talked before like voice and choice which is more Bottoms Up and grassroot but it is really important for the leadership to really be bought in on the call causes that.

221
00:38:14,903 --> 00:38:22,903
The company is supporting and so yeah I can't like underscore that enough, that it's really important for the leaders to be bought in.

222
00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:32,003
I think that more and more like it very many does seem to be the rhetoric and you know like ESG has become much more kind of like top of mine.

223
00:38:32,003 --> 00:38:41,703
And, so I think that folks really are moving in that direction and it and hopefully, it won't be super difficult to convince any leaders who aren't yet bought in.

224
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:47,703
But I have just seen really effective uses of leadership bodden.

225
00:38:47,703 --> 00:39:06,603
So, you know you have all hands maybe once a week once a month and to have the leaders talking about the programming and the causes and the nonprofits and the impact during those team meetings is really, really an Active and it certainly shows how much they care and are bada in.

226
00:39:08,303 --> 00:39:20,303
I have also seen like really cool things where they will like, send an email and say I am going to this opportunity or like I will be attending this virtual opportunity and I would love for you to join of kind of this, like, Collective impact.

227
00:39:20,303 --> 00:39:31,203
And it also gives you face time to spend with an executive which can never hurt and so stuff like that, you know, and even, it's not just like the top executive.

228
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:42,703
It's also like managers and So then with like your team meetings to have it is again baked in as like an agenda point to say you know these this is our policy reminder to use your vtl like stuff.

229
00:39:42,703 --> 00:39:44,203
Like that is really important.

230
00:39:46,203 --> 00:39:58,603
And then I think that last part of the question I am just like if they're not yet bought in like reach out to our team, we have so many business use cases of like why it's really important to invest here?

231
00:39:58,903 --> 00:40:10,403
I think obviously like the big ones that a lot of people care about is Like the retention and the Recruitment, and the Fulfillment statistics, but there's even more than that.

232
00:40:10,403 --> 00:40:12,903
So they're certainly like lots of stuff.

233
00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:25,903
We can hopefully arm you with, to convince anybody who's not, but in yet, Laura just mentioned that they have done volunteer with me events with execs that have gone over pretty well.

234
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:45,403
That's an interesting idea to do events and have them have the executives, probably Express their passion, and belief around a certain cause I think that over communication is really key from the leadership perspective, totally.

235
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:48,903
And I think it like it reminds me some Early to PTO.

236
00:40:48,903 --> 00:40:56,703
Like I think it's really means a lot when an executive says, Hey I am going on PTO and I here's my out of office.

237
00:40:56,703 --> 00:41:02,103
I am not going to be reached and it really like sets the example of how important that is and that you want to feel refresh.

238
00:41:02,103 --> 00:41:10,703
And it's the same thing for volunteering is like, hey, I am going to take two hours this afternoon, and I am going to be here and here's like a photo of me doing it.

239
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:15,503
And I am a proponent of all of our employees doing this so it's really just like leading, by example.

240
00:41:16,503 --> 00:41:17,103
That's good.

241
00:41:17,903 --> 00:41:28,003
I would think that storytelling is also a key vehicle to support engagement of employees.

242
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:34,403
This isn't something we talked about as a question, but I am curious Olivia from your perspective.

243
00:41:34,503 --> 00:41:41,103
Any input on companies, you have seen that do storytelling really well around their social impact.

244
00:41:41,603 --> 00:41:43,303
That's such a good question.

245
00:41:44,103 --> 00:41:49,303
And yes, I mean I and I think Knowing like very specific stories.

246
00:41:49,303 --> 00:42:03,403
And I think this Loops all the way back to the very beginning of what we're talking about with intentionality and potentially, like, Drilling in on one or two causes that you as a company like, it feels very authentic that you would support this particular cause or this particular nonprofit or group of nonprofits.

247
00:42:03,803 --> 00:42:16,003
Then I think you become so much more familiar and you have like these actual stories of nonprofits and volunteers and donors that have been working together over weeks.

248
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:20,303
Sir years like that might have had a really incredible experience.

249
00:42:20,303 --> 00:42:27,303
One afternoon with a team or with an executive like you can create more of those like deeper relationships.

250
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:32,903
So I think that's like another reason to kind of dig in a little bit on some of these causes.

251
00:42:33,803 --> 00:42:43,703
But it also reminds me of something we have talked about, which is just how important it is for social impact teams to work, so closely with other teams.

252
00:42:43,703 --> 00:42:56,103
So, like a comms team is a Perfect example is like you want to be super abreast of what comms is working on and what and you want them to know exactly what you're working on.

253
00:42:56,103 --> 00:43:07,203
Because like you mentioned, like both internally and externally it's so important how you talk about this and how you really like make people feel included and excited and that impact is happening.

254
00:43:08,603 --> 00:43:13,103
And so the more you can share like those individual Stories, the kind of like Collective impact stories.

255
00:43:13,103 --> 00:43:18,503
We just had an amazing partner who they're like, Around sustainability and climate change.

256
00:43:18,503 --> 00:43:30,503
And they had this really cool like walk challenge that we were a part of to and so that was just like it wasn't even like direct volunteering but definitely falls under the impact bucket.

257
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:31,803
And it was super cool.

258
00:43:31,803 --> 00:43:33,103
Like how they kept all of us.

259
00:43:33,103 --> 00:43:36,203
Abreast of like, how many steps did we have?

260
00:43:36,203 --> 00:43:38,703
We met how many trees then have been planted?

261
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:40,603
Like how many steps do we have to go?

262
00:43:41,303 --> 00:43:45,903
And so definitely, like working super close to with your comms and marketing team on.

263
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:51,903
How to message that and kind of like, spread the good that y'all are doing, That's great.

264
00:43:52,303 --> 00:43:53,303
Thanks, thanks Olivia.

265
00:43:53,303 --> 00:43:57,303
I know you got some questions that I am seeing pop up in the Q&A.

266
00:43:57,503 --> 00:44:04,703
Before we transition to Q&A, I have one last question here, you know, companies even more.

267
00:44:04,703 --> 00:44:11,403
So, today are being urged to share, not only what they stand for, but what they stand up for.

268
00:44:12,203 --> 00:44:15,103
So that's in this case of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

269
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,403
A company social impact strategy.

270
00:44:17,403 --> 00:44:21,103
Also, needs to be part of that core Strategy.

271
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:28,403
But how can companies do this respectfully and authentically with all the other things going on?

272
00:44:28,903 --> 00:44:30,003
What do you advise?

273
00:44:30,203 --> 00:44:32,903
Yeah, yeah it's really hard.

274
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:37,303
Let us just say that first and definitely something that like every single company is thinking about.

275
00:44:37,303 --> 00:44:48,203
And I feel like even in the past year, there's been like many, many things that I am sure companies who is a kind of struggled with how to talk about and support or not support.

276
00:44:48,703 --> 00:44:50,503
Another really good reason why you need to work.

277
00:44:50,603 --> 00:45:01,603
Super closely with comms super closely with the people team, the HR team, and then obviously have execs interested in part of the conversation because those are likely the people that are kind of stakeholders there.

278
00:45:01,803 --> 00:45:20,503
But I think, when we talk to our partners, about trying to figure out, like, where or how to come out on certain issues or questions, it's more like just what feels the most authentic to you as a company and that can sometimes be kind of hard to get at, but a lot of our clients that we have worked with that, like do it in the best.

279
00:45:20,703 --> 00:45:30,003
Way it's a lot about communicating correctly, but then also like, leaving that space for folks who might not agree in the exact same way.

280
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:31,903
So either be heard or to feel supported.

281
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:37,803
So we have given this example a couple times but it's like you know the 1X matching to whatever nonprofits.

282
00:45:37,803 --> 00:45:56,403
They choose within you know a certain we have a lot of folks who like won't do political or religious, obviously like hate groups are always blocked but that you do allow people to give somewhere that they would Like voice and choice, but then you're like doubling down on donations towards organizations that you really care about.

283
00:45:58,603 --> 00:46:10,703
So that's one thing and then I think we mentioned this too, but like being really clear like what are the Evergreen causes that you care about and like those things likely won't really change.

284
00:46:10,703 --> 00:46:28,003
But then building in the place to be more, reactive to disaster relief or different things that happen because then I think, We tend to communicate that like this is our policy like we designate 80% of our resources towards these certain things.

285
00:46:28,003 --> 00:46:33,303
We know are going to happen and then the rest is like for things that might pop up.

286
00:46:33,303 --> 00:46:37,903
And so we have seen that to be really effective because then employees just like understand what's going on.

287
00:46:37,903 --> 00:46:45,203
Like they're like you know, they can't respond to everything because you only have 20% of resources allocated to disaster relief, or whatever it might be.

288
00:46:45,203 --> 00:46:50,403
So just being like very upfront and then the companies know the best.

289
00:46:50,603 --> 00:46:56,003
Like what is your company culture and community and like what's going to resonate the most with them?

290
00:46:56,503 --> 00:46:58,303
So again just like a big plug to work.

291
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:06,603
So closely with the comms team, the marketing team, the people team to make sure that you're communicating it in the right way.

292
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:09,003
That's so good.

293
00:47:09,003 --> 00:47:17,603
I love the clarity of the percentage breakdowns and being really clear with your employees.

294
00:47:17,903 --> 00:47:22,603
This is, you know where we're, we're participating and how you can participate.

295
00:47:22,603 --> 00:47:25,303
I think that Clarity is really helpful.

296
00:47:25,703 --> 00:47:26,103
Yeah.

297
00:47:26,203 --> 00:47:27,003
I totally agree.

298
00:47:27,003 --> 00:47:33,103
And we see that we have an amazing support team and I feel like they really lean into that.

299
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:45,603
Like, you know, just simply saying like this is the That our platform is working on, like if you have questions or like working by, if you have questions on that like we're happy to talk you through it.

300
00:47:45,603 --> 00:47:47,303
But like here's all the information.

301
00:47:47,703 --> 00:47:54,203
And usually I mean, people usually are very reasonable, and they're like oh I understand because this is the policy that's been set up.

302
00:47:54,203 --> 00:48:07,003
I think we're where they're sometimes confusion like is when there's ambiguity, but it's really, you know, I get it because these are really like difficult conversations and decisions to make, but I think like as clear as you.

303
00:48:07,103 --> 00:48:19,103
Can be unlike your plan and your policies, and your process, the more that employees are like, oh yeah, I get that like that's reasonable, that's good and Ingrid just mention, it's easier to say no, as well, the clear you are.

304
00:48:19,203 --> 00:48:39,003
So it gets me thinking, you know, it's really key to have an owner that's really driving this initiative and driving the cross-departmental alignment and communication all that With the customers that you work with, what, what are you seeing as that common stakeholder owner?

305
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:42,503
Like, what is their title, who generally owns it?

306
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,503
Where do they sit in organization?

307
00:48:44,903 --> 00:48:48,803
Yes, that's such a good question and it does it vary for sure.

308
00:48:48,903 --> 00:49:01,703
So, I would say, like, the most common title we see is like head of social impact director of social impact, depending on how big the company is and how much they have invested in social impact.

309
00:49:02,103 --> 00:49:02,703
They will often times.

310
00:49:02,803 --> 00:49:22,603
Like potentially a couple folks part of that team like somebody that might be focused more on volunteering, someone that might be focused on disaster relief, for example, or donations like somebody who's more on the policy side of things like, making sure the volunteer time off policy is set and write and like the donations policy.

311
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,703
So, like different people format in different ways.

312
00:49:26,703 --> 00:49:32,703
Sometimes there's like an engagement specialist that job is so fun and like gets to come up with different ideas on.

313
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:40,103
Unlike how to engage folks, in that company's impact and then it also sits in different places.

314
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:45,703
I have seen it likes it, I think the most common and to me makes the most sense is under people team.

315
00:49:45,703 --> 00:49:52,103
So like HR people just because it really is like such a benefit to the employee into the company.

316
00:49:52,603 --> 00:49:55,003
So that's probably where I have seen it the most.

317
00:49:55,003 --> 00:50:04,803
But I have also seen it fall like under like policy teams and comms teams just because like, depending again on the type The financial institutions is a good one.

318
00:50:04,803 --> 00:50:10,703
Like they have to do so much reporting that it might make sense for that to be like under more of a policy or a comms umbrella.

319
00:50:12,703 --> 00:50:14,403
That's helpful, great.

320
00:50:14,503 --> 00:50:17,003
All right, let us transition into some of this Q&A.

321
00:50:17,503 --> 00:50:19,303
We have got a question here.

322
00:50:19,403 --> 00:50:21,403
Jessica is our producer in the green room.

323
00:50:21,403 --> 00:50:26,903
Thank you so much for pressing, the keys here, because you bring the question to the stage.

324
00:50:27,603 --> 00:50:32,703
How, and when do you introduce these communities and keep them relevant as employees settle in?

325
00:50:32,703 --> 00:50:36,903
So, you touch this a little bit earlier Olivia, what are your thoughts?

326
00:50:37,603 --> 00:50:37,903
Yes.

327
00:50:37,903 --> 00:50:38,803
Really good question.

328
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:53,703
So when I think of this question and happy to go in a different direction but I think of like employee resource groups or potentially like Regional Ambassador groups, and so we can start talking about ER, G's and can take it in whatever direction is most helpful.

329
00:50:54,803 --> 00:51:04,603
But again, this kind of seems like a theme so important to wear it with the people team in the HR team because they're often times the one's kind of standing up the ERG groups.

330
00:51:05,603 --> 00:51:14,203
But as we also mentioned earlier like the earlier you can incorporate impact into ER GS the better because then it kind of becomes part of their ethos.

331
00:51:14,603 --> 00:51:20,103
We have worked with some companies that the ERG is and actually on deed we have like special ERG pages.

332
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:35,303
And on that page, you put like your logo and a lot of companies have like super funny or do you logos and then also a description and so some people will have like mission statements for their ERG, and they will build impact into that.

333
00:51:35,403 --> 00:51:36,403
Mission statement.

334
00:51:36,403 --> 00:51:56,203
And, so I love that because it automatically creates a space where that is something that's like intended to be something that they think about and do and talk about that would be like, my biggest advice would be like early and often like try to bake it into the mission statement if you can.

335
00:51:57,203 --> 00:52:02,003
And then second part I am just making sure I answered all the parts of it.

336
00:52:04,203 --> 00:52:06,603
It might be in the answered part 02.

337
00:52:06,603 --> 00:52:07,603
Keep them relevant.

338
00:52:07,703 --> 00:52:12,603
So then I think the relevancy part is kind of again going back to like the listening tour in the surveys.

339
00:52:12,603 --> 00:52:20,903
Like once that your G is going and has they're like impact part of the mission statement and is like rocking and rolling.

340
00:52:21,503 --> 00:52:26,503
Usually they don't need to like too much driving behind them.

341
00:52:26,503 --> 00:52:33,303
Because, like I said, it's like people who really identify with that, cause with those nonprofits, and they can kind of like, do it themselves.

342
00:52:33,503 --> 00:52:47,903
Elves, but if it's not moving so much like kind of finding out why like, hey we have given you the resources, you have a budget of, you know, 25,000 dollars to go matching, how you want, you know, you have the time you have the VTO policies.

343
00:52:47,903 --> 00:52:49,503
Like what, how, what's missing?

344
00:52:49,503 --> 00:52:53,003
How can we support you to drive that impact within your ear G?

345
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:59,203
So hopefully that's a little bit helpful in terms of how args work I have .

346
00:52:59,203 --> 00:53:03,403
Like seen people use them to do really cool.

347
00:53:03,503 --> 00:53:03,903
Stuff.

348
00:53:03,903 --> 00:53:12,203
And even do like full presentations again at all hands, that specifically about the impact that the ERG made in communities.

349
00:53:12,603 --> 00:53:30,103
And so, that's like a way to kind of bring everything together that we have talked about of, like, highlighting the work that the ERG is doing, specifically focused on impact in there, cause area, which is just really cool and I think pretty inspiring for other people to be like, oh, I want to do that with my ear G with like the nonprofit's that we care about.

350
00:53:31,303 --> 00:53:32,103
So good.

351
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:34,603
Are we have another question here?

352
00:53:36,103 --> 00:53:45,903
What advice do you have for rapidly growing organizations trying to structure their current charitable giving programs and who are key stakeholders to get in the room?

353
00:53:47,203 --> 00:53:59,903
Awesome, I think we're just pulling now from other conversations we have had but I, you can pull from kind of that super power structure of like, you know, feeling like a little bit intimidated of not knowing where to start.

354
00:54:00,603 --> 00:54:05,703
But as I think MacKinnon mentioned like early and often like get it super built in.

355
00:54:06,003 --> 00:54:17,003
To your company's ethos and the employees and as you're hiring, and then think about like what is the thing that we want to change or help solve, you know, what is our super power?

356
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:19,203
And then how are we going to actually tangibly?

357
00:54:19,203 --> 00:54:19,903
Do it?

358
00:54:20,803 --> 00:54:25,403
And then, in terms of stakeholders are moving, talked about this a lot too, but exacts leadership.

359
00:54:25,403 --> 00:54:35,703
So, so important to have them on board, the like comms team marketing, team people in HR team and then I would say like those, ER, G's for sure.

360
00:54:35,803 --> 00:54:41,003
Sure and usually ERG is had like a leader or some type of like boards that you could work with.

361
00:54:41,303 --> 00:54:54,003
I mentioned these like Regional ambassadors, but we do have some companies who are super Global, and so they need to make sure that a lot of there they will have like a big employee population in India and so that's going to be like a very different kind of giving culture.

362
00:54:54,203 --> 00:55:03,803
Then we might see in the US or the UK and so that Regional Ambassador is so helpful to be able to say to like help set up local opportunities.

363
00:55:03,803 --> 00:55:13,203
But also communicate back and say like This is what we need as like, a team in India, that might be different from what the team is doing and Australia, or the UK or the US.

364
00:55:13,703 --> 00:55:17,903
Wow, that's another layer to factor in is the regionality?

365
00:55:18,203 --> 00:55:19,603
That's, that's huge.

366
00:55:19,603 --> 00:55:24,203
And, and identifying the local communities to be part of per region across the globe.

367
00:55:24,203 --> 00:55:25,003
That's good.

368
00:55:25,803 --> 00:55:26,203
All right.

369
00:55:26,203 --> 00:55:28,603
We have got our third question here.

370
00:55:30,003 --> 00:55:34,803
What advice do you have on wedding organizations to partner with?

371
00:55:34,903 --> 00:55:41,903
We want to make sure we align with their values and Mission as well, but this can be hard to find without conversation.

372
00:55:42,903 --> 00:55:48,303
Good, classic and question and something we work on with our clients all the time.

373
00:55:48,903 --> 00:55:50,703
I will personally give a little plug.

374
00:55:50,703 --> 00:55:55,403
So at deed, we have a non-profit, success team, and so they work very closely.

375
00:55:55,403 --> 00:55:56,703
We have a partner success team.

376
00:55:56,703 --> 00:55:59,603
That works, that is like our clients point of contact.

377
00:55:59,703 --> 00:56:04,303
Then our team is also working directly with the nonprofit success team.

378
00:56:04,503 --> 00:56:13,103
And these are folks that have worked at nonprofits worked at wedding organizations and like really, really understand the landscape and what you're looking for there.

379
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:19,503
So with our clients, that is an easier question to answer because they get to work directly with our nonprofit success team.

380
00:56:19,703 --> 00:56:23,003
And that team helps them like give recommendations.

381
00:56:23,003 --> 00:56:24,403
They have already done a lot of the vetting.

382
00:56:24,403 --> 00:56:26,403
They might be able to connect them if they can.

383
00:56:28,003 --> 00:56:37,703
But if you're kind of doing it on your own, I think there's like a lot of different things that you can do especially now in the wonderful age of the internet.

384
00:56:37,803 --> 00:56:51,803
I mean, obviously there's like the Baseline which is like checking on guidestar and network for good and places to make sure they're like in good standing with the IRS that's like Baseline and there's other equivalents in other places.

385
00:56:52,503 --> 00:56:55,703
But then we do like a lot of research on social media.

386
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:59,603
Like a lot of times now, nonprofits have Facebook, they have Instagram.

387
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:02,203
Like are they active, are they doing things?

388
00:57:02,203 --> 00:57:03,803
Like, are they being transparent?

389
00:57:03,803 --> 00:57:06,103
Are they putting out different statements on things?

390
00:57:06,603 --> 00:57:20,303
You can like glean, a decent amount of information there and then a lot of times, you know, nonprofits need and want our help especially companies just because they know that it is, the collective impact piece.

391
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:25,503
So I would definitely not hesitate in reaching out and just asking to have a conversation with them.

392
00:57:26,303 --> 00:57:27,103
It would be like, good debt.

393
00:57:27,103 --> 00:57:29,703
Probably have a couple questions that you asked all nonprofits.

394
00:57:29,803 --> 00:57:34,403
Just so you have like an across the board questions that you ask for folks.

395
00:57:35,603 --> 00:57:45,203
But yeah, those I think would be my recommendations is like, you know, check the, the validated sources that you already have access to like, look at their present you again.

396
00:57:45,203 --> 00:57:47,103
He said, Network for good.

397
00:57:47,203 --> 00:57:49,503
Now we're forgetting guidestar ones that we use a lot.

398
00:57:49,503 --> 00:57:51,703
But yeah, those are just places that you can like type in there.

399
00:57:51,703 --> 00:57:57,603
Ein, get some information, some financial information, so that's like a good place to start.

400
00:57:57,703 --> 00:58:07,803
Look at their social media, look at their website, like some nonprofits haven't updated their website in a really, really long time, which could because of lack of resources, which is even more, so why you should help them.

401
00:58:08,803 --> 00:58:14,403
But, you know, that could be something that you want to look into or ask about like maybe their defunct or not doing that much.

402
00:58:15,103 --> 00:58:29,403
And then the last one would just be, you know try to get on the phone with them or at the very least like send some questions over email because they want our support, and so they should be super open and transparent about what they're up to and what the funds go to.

403
00:58:30,403 --> 00:58:40,203
Our team just as like an incredible job and looking like, at what percentage of funds are going, we're like how much are they paying their stuff based on the donations that come in?

404
00:58:40,203 --> 00:58:51,803
So, lots of different things that you can look at, but our nonprofit success seemed, like I said, I will give them a little plug, they are just incredible, and they do a lot of this for our clients and with our clients and partnership.

405
00:58:53,703 --> 00:58:54,603
That's awesome.

406
00:58:55,303 --> 00:58:56,003
Wow.

407
00:58:56,003 --> 00:59:20,003
So many golden insights Olivia that you dropped for us during this time and it looks like we have wrapped all the questions if anyone has a last-minute question, feel free to drop that in, but other than that, Olivia, would you have any parting words of advice or anything for our guest today?

408
00:59:21,303 --> 00:59:23,303
Yes, I think.

409
00:59:24,303 --> 00:59:36,703
I think the biggest one which we already talked about is just making sure that you are building in that space to be reactive because, you know, it's a crazy world that we live in and so many different things are moving and changing.

410
00:59:36,703 --> 00:59:39,303
And so, it's really important to have those core pillars of.

411
00:59:39,303 --> 00:59:41,503
Like, this is what we care about in, this is what we stand for.

412
00:59:41,803 --> 00:59:51,103
But then also, knowing that so many things are moving and changing that, you want to have that elasticity to be able to react to it because that's going to be really important to your employees.

413
00:59:51,103 --> 00:59:52,003
So that's one thing.

414
00:59:52,103 --> 01:00:01,103
And then the other thing I think Ink which hopefully we mention and gave some examples of but like engagement Employee Engagement, especially around giving should be fun.

415
01:00:01,203 --> 01:00:06,103
Like there's so many fun things that you can do like, employee resource groups.

416
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:10,803
Have done the coolest things and it's stuff that like, they really, really, really care about.

417
01:00:11,203 --> 01:00:14,203
I think my favorite thing and it doesn't have to be employee resource groups.

418
01:00:14,203 --> 01:00:19,003
It could be like companies, and they got an insane percentage of Engagement.

419
01:00:19,003 --> 01:00:26,703
Like I want to say higher than 80% of Engagement was like a I think Challenge and you could do it with exact switch.

420
01:00:26,703 --> 01:00:36,703
I have seen done where like, you know, six execs record themselves singing to a different song and then that is paired with, like, they're nonprofit of choice.

421
01:00:36,703 --> 01:00:40,703
And so, you play it during an all hands or like a happy hour.

422
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:45,803
And then to vote for that video, or for that, exact, and that nonprofit, you donate to them.

423
01:00:45,903 --> 01:00:52,403
And so then you can see, you know, you have those six nonprofits and whoever whatever nonprofit raises, the most money, like that exact one.

424
01:00:52,603 --> 01:01:02,703
And so, you could do that Also, by teams like I have seen that like, the marketing team versus the Eng team first, the Congo cetera, and so they will do like a group link saying core lip sync or like do it.

425
01:01:03,603 --> 01:01:09,203
I have also seen the same thing done with a pet fashion show, so, you know, daily were part of that.

426
01:01:09,303 --> 01:01:16,703
So you can make it really fun, and then they're like supporting a Humane Society or something like that, so you can make it really fun.

427
01:01:17,303 --> 01:01:19,403
And I have seen that be really effective.

428
01:01:19,403 --> 01:01:23,303
In terms of just employees, getting excited and feeling motivated and connected.

429
01:01:23,503 --> 01:01:26,203
Their companies but also to their colleagues.

430
01:01:27,603 --> 01:01:30,003
Those are awesome points.

431
01:01:30,003 --> 01:01:32,003
Thank you so much.

432
01:01:32,003 --> 01:01:37,003
I think each of us are going to take something away from this and be able to apply it very quickly.

433
01:01:37,303 --> 01:01:38,903
So, thank you, Olivia.

434
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:41,603

So, thank you so much for tuning in.

8
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:27,960
We have got a power panel today and the topic is going to be fire.

9
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:33,960
It's all about developing strong relationships in the workplace, you know?

10
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,260
Actually before I jump in note that there is Q&A because people have submitted their this is a Hot Topic.

11
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:50,560
So we have had folks submit questions in advance, upvote your most burning questions and feel free to drop questions because we're going to answer them as we go.

12
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,660
So I want to start with this pole and I have got Katie.

13
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,260
Thank you.

14
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,460
She's in the Green Room, our event producer lead, can you pull up that pole for us?

15
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,560
And let us just take this quick.

16
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:02,960
Pull.

17
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:11,360
What's the workplace relationship that has had the most significant and positive impact on you?

18
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,360
Is it a mentor?

19
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,760
A coach, a manager appear a direct report or other feel free to drop in your votes.

20
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,160
Interesting.

21
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,660
Okay, so we're seeing manager as highest wow.

22
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,660
That is probably one of the most significant relationships.

23
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,760
We're going to unpack that email a bit more, and then we got peer and Mentor.

24
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,660
Very cool.

25
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,260
Okay.

26
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Thank you for placing those votes recently Gallop had just released this study of the increasing importance of having the best friend at work.

27
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,460
And I don't know if that's necessarily your manager, or maybe it's more of a Here.

28
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,260
But take a look at that Nifty overlay there.

29
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:05,360
You can see the statistics and you know, the statistics are mentioning and you can see, you know, year over a year how much having the best friend at work?

30
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:18,660
Can truly tie back to retention and happiness at work and it's essential for social emotional support and ultimately supporting strong business outcomes.

31
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,860
And, so I want to unpack this a little bit more with our amazing.

32
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,160
Amazing panel.

33
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:36,460
If we can enter bring them up on to the stage here we have got a me who's the VP of people success that torch Elizabeth who's the head of Behavioral Science insights at torch and Vicki.

34
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,560
The VP of people Ops at bonus Lee, will you join me on stage?

35
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,960
Hello.

36
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,960
Anyway, Harry great, to be here to view.

37
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,260
Where are you tuning in from and what time is it?

38
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,860
Just curious.

39
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,360
We will start with you.

40
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,960
Vicki, I am in Colorado, and it is lunchtime.

41
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,760
Noon, noon o'clock.

42
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,660
Nice have a UAV.

43
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,360
Also, coming to you from Mountain Time Zone.

44
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:12,160
It's not very common that we have to, from Mountain Time Zone, but I am in Park City Utah.

45
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,760
Great.

46
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,960
And I am in the Bay area.

47
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,260
So I saw a lot of folks who are also in the Bay Area.

48
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:27,060
Hello, but I am on SO West Coast time so it's just a little after 11 year awesome and Elizabeth.

49
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:35,160
I am going to pause on you could you tell us a little bit about yourself and about torch, and then we will go backwards to go to a me then Vicki?

50
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,060
Yeah, absolutely.

51
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,560
So I am the head of behavioural science.

52
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,060
Insights that torch and torch is we really Torch?

53
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,860
We feel growth through the power of relationships and feel professional growth.

54
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,960
So we do mentoring coaching, and we have a Collaborative Learning platform.

55
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,660
And what I do in my role, my background is a little non-traditional.

56
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,260
I worked as a journalist for many years and then found the field of Behavioral Science and became an applied behavioral scientist.

57
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:21,860
But I think what really ties all of my interests together is this curiosity about why people do what they do and really want to understand human motivation and kind of how we learn how we grow and how we really kind of can reach our full potential as people.

58
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:42,060
So what I do at torch is I work with, lots of different teams are Behavioral Science team, our marketing team our sales team to really understand what are we learning from our platform about how people learn to grow and change over time and hopefully share things that really helped all of us do that better in our professional lives.

59
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,160
Love it.

60
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,860
Thank you.

61
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,260
Amy.

62
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,360
Maybe tell us a little about what you do with torch.

63
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,160
Yes.

64
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,060
Also hear from Team torch.

65
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:12,760
I lead our people success team at torch and people success is essentially another word for our people or human resources team, but it was really important to me as I came into this role to signal that we are here too.

66
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,660
Ali fuel, people's happiness, and success at work.

67
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:33,460
So, we actually use in part of why I work so closely with the amazing Elizabeth is, we use a lot of the science behind happiness and success at work, to organize our team and to really help people to bring their best selves to work so that they can do their best work.

68
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:43,360
So I am really excited about this topic because relationships and connection are such a huge part of our engagement and happiness at work.

69
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,860
Thanks, Amy Vicky.

70
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,060
So my name is Vicky young.

71
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,560
I am the VP of operations at bonus Lee.

72
00:22:51,560 --> 00:23:05,860
Also, another word for HR and it's also interesting is my first time working in a company that sells a product primarily to HR people, to that talks about engagement and how recognition can enhance culture.

73
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,460
So definitely it's a bit meta.

74
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,760
I think, working at places probably like, torching bonus lie, where we do a lot of research, we share a lot of information.

75
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,360
We also have to make sure that we're living that inside our company so a lot of fun to be able to do that and to do work.

76
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,260
I think (differently) than how we fizz it happens.

77
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,060
That's great.

78
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:37,260
So I want to kick off with just a very real question right now, you know, we're in this time of a lot of change uncertainty.

79
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,460
Downturn is what it can feel like so.

80
00:23:41,460 --> 00:24:04,360
So then why is building strong work relationships business critical during times like this, Yeah, I mean, I would say building strong workplace relationships is always really important but it is especially important now, and we can get into a little bit as far as what the research says on this.

81
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,160
Even though I think one of the reasons why this topic is so powerful is because we all kind of intuitively.

82
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,560
Also know, this is true.

83
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,360
We know that when we have strong relationships at work, right?

84
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,360
We're just happier people we do better but in terms of what some of the Nina sighs.

85
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,260
Let us start with kind of to Big Business outcomes.

86
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,260
That folks are looking at one is performance and the other is retention.

87
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:39,260
So, we know from, there's some great research from this research, Consortium called, connected Commons, and they have looked at the relationship skills of their.

88
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,660
They have looked at kind of what is critical to Performance.

89
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:49,360
And they found that relationship skills are really cored to individual performance team, performance and organizational performance.

90
00:24:49,760 --> 00:25:01,360
And specifically what they have found is that somebody's ability to generate energy and enthusiasm within their network is the largest predictor of being a high performer at work.

91
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,660
And they found that leaders do this.

92
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:21,160
Basically, in three ways, one is by building a foundation of trust, the other is helping others, find a sense of purpose in their work and the third is really creating energy and daily interactions and I can go into any Those in a little bit more detail.

93
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:34,060
But I really thought that was super interesting that this is, you know, when we think about high performer and what a high performer, looks like that ability to generate energy enthusiasm within their network is so huge.

94
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,760
And you know what?

95
00:25:36,760 --> 00:26:01,260
They have also found in other research and this was based on interviews, conducted with 160 liters across 20, different organizations kind of talked about the connection between Ation ships and retention and said that the willingness to stay in an organization is really impacted dramatically by the quality of relationships and somebody's Network.

96
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:09,160
So, according to these researchers, and I will quote them here because I think it's really powerful, and they found in their research.

97
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:19,360
Is that thriving at work is often as much or more about the relationships and quality of interactions with others as the type or Pace of work?

98
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:19,760
Eight.

99
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:35,060
So, and I think this gets at this kind of myth that a lot of us, hold around, hold around work which is that, you know, we have this idea of what a dream job looks like and like, oh, I really want to, you know, work on this particular topic and that's what's going to make me happy.

100
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,860
And sure that's important to your Wellness, you know, and kind of well-being and happiness at work.

101
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,560
But even more important is the relationships.

102
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:49,360
You have and so many of you responded, you know, to that opening question, how important a manager relation?

103
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,460
Essentia Paz, right?

104
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,660
Like you could be working on the topic that you think is so interesting and important to you.

105
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:02,460
But if your relationship with your manager isn't where you'd like it to be, you're probably not going to care very much about that.

106
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:20,460
Super interesting topic that you're working on the one final thing that I will say here before I turn it over to Amy who I know, has some other great information about this is they did a study, researchers did a study where they looked at connectivity across 40,000 people.

107
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:40,460
And they looked at voluntary turnover, and they found that when they looked at employees who had been there for less than one year when they looked at kind of what predicted them leaving, it wasn't the number of ties they had to other people but what did predict it was?

108
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,860
How many other people in the organization sought them out for help and advice?

109
00:27:44,860 --> 00:28:02,560
So it's not necessarily oh I have this huge Network and that's the thing that It matters what matters even more was are other people saying or other people trying to bring this person in for help and advice, which is this really interesting indicator of trust, right?

110
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,760
And of kind of wanting to keep somebody around, pull them into your teams or groups.

111
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:17,160
So, I will let a me to take it from here and share a little bit more about what we know about why relationships are so business-critical.

112
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:18,960
Yeah.

113
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,560
Thanks, Elizabeth and such powerful data, and I am already seeing lots of people asking for links to the studies.

114
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:31,760
You know, I think one thing I would just add to that is how this need is kind of universal need.

115
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,360
That's probably always been there.

116
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:43,560
But we have seen it really spike in the last couple of years with you know a move to a lot of people moving to a hybrid work situation.

117
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,760
A lot of just challenging things happening in the world.

118
00:28:46,760 --> 00:29:06,660
A lot of people soul-searching and Thinking about the purpose and the work that they do and in some, some research that LinkedIn and glint did at the end of 2020, that really struck me is looking at what drives whether or not people think that they have a great culture at their company.

119
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:28,360
And looking at the top drivers of a great culture, we actually saw that belonging increase to the number two, most important thing that drives They're not peopled love their culture and, you know, we have always known that belonging is important but that actually went up four spots in terms of impact, which is a pretty significant shift.

120
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:36,460
You don't often see that data shift as significantly usually stays pretty stable and you know it makes a lot of sense.

121
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:54,360
What people want to feel like I have so much going on in the world and in my life and where I am spending so much of my waking hours, I want to feel like I belong here and I will say to That the only thing that we ranked higher in terms of the impact on a great culture is opportunities to learn and grow.

122
00:29:54,660 --> 00:30:04,460
And I think that's just both of those like number one and number two are so critical to relationships are so critical to people's ability to feel like they belong.

123
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:22,760
And we also know that relationships have an outsized impact on whether or not people feel like they can grow at an organization you more so than a training course or formal programs having someone that invests in you and that you trust And that can help you navigate and in many cases that might be a manager.

124
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:30,260
So, those are again things that have always been important, but that have really increased in importance that people are looking to more and more.

125
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:45,160
As you know, the world of work is changing dramatically and it gets really interesting when you try to think about how to create and facilitate belonging and what often is feels like a two-dimensional screen for many people.

126
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:52,360
So I am looking forward to talking about that, that more So rich.

127
00:30:52,460 --> 00:31:01,460
I feel like I am processing all of those data points and thank you for Brian for sharing some of that research in the chat Vicki.

128
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,560
Yeah, I would plus one, everything.

129
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,460
Elizabeth and Amy are saying, I think, you know, just specially the last two years.

130
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,660
We were spending a lot more time.

131
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,660
Evaluating what we want to spend our time on?

132
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:21,760
And also I think going from a lot of office work to suddenly remote, for many people has been drastically different.

133
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,360
And how are we making those connections?

134
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,660
And I have noticed how when there is a lack of connection, you do see that attrition, you see the burnout?

135
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,160
You see the feeling of being alone.

136
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,760
Own when you're in the office you can kind of vent over the same type of thing.

137
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,060
They can talk to each other, and so we actually our company had our in two years.

138
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:49,160
Our first get to human get together in person at the end of July and the energy coming out of that was just so different.

139
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:55,360
And even before that, I think to the Elizabeth or eating might have mentioned this earlier, this is always been the case, right?

140
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,960
You have those connections with each other has always been important.

141
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:07,660
Anytime I see teams, especially cross-functionally, when they're not Working well together if you start putting them together to so that they get to know each other as human beings.

142
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,660
So it's not about work, right?

143
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:14,360
Like we literally took the team, bowling, put them on different teams, had them, you know, we put in by games and stuff.

144
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:20,060
So the team that scored the most points or do the most whatever's got kind of prizes, right?

145
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,360
And it changed the dynamic.

146
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,960
When they headed back into the office, to actually do the work stuff.

147
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:34,860
So there's a lot of, I think more empathy building, when you create those relationships, and a lot of more trust-building, when you create those relationships, That's huge.

148
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:54,260
So, you know, managers came up high in the pole and obviously, there's an opportunity and that relationship manager to employee even across department leaders to employee how if we're leader manager here, what can we do to help create?

149
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:12,560
And facilitate that environment that does build healthy team relationships Yeah, I think being a manager is really hard, especially right now and it's not often something that you're kind of taught.

150
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:18,460
Think most people are really thrown into it before they even get any training and there's a lot you could do.

151
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:25,160
So there's the building, I think of psychological safety and trust with the individual and then creating that on the team too.

152
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,860
So how are you creating space to actually make mistakes?

153
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,960
We talk about a lot of this all the time.

154
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,060
How you're supposed to do these things but How do you actually do?

155
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,160
It is a lot more difficult and sometimes not as clear.

156
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:44,560
And so being able to create Clarity for the team, helped create expectations, right?

157
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:52,660
A talking about the places where you have messed up or even how you react when someone messes up and especially under stress lately.

158
00:33:53,560 --> 00:34:04,060
So, it's a lot about, you know, you show up as a leader you and your people manager showing up you talk and just I think talking about it often times, we're trying To almost spin things.

159
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:08,360
A little too much and I think if we just show a little bit more of our human side and be a little bit more vulnerable.

160
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,360
As people managers, it goes a long way saying, you know, I care.

161
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:21,860
I do have a question about psychological safety since you brought that up is there.

162
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:29,159
Things we can do is managers today to encourage and create an environment of psychological safety.

163
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:37,159
Yeah, I would say the biggest thing is consistency in how you and oftentimes how you react to things they need to.

164
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,659
Like, our brains are wired to go and look for everything that is wrong in our environment, right?

165
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:46,360
It's kind of natural, it's just in our brain.

166
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,060
So our amygdala goes off and were like, oh my God, is that rustling in the trees?

167
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,159
Going to be this giant thing that's going to eat me.

168
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,560
And now in the workplace is it is this going to hurt me somehow?

169
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,660
And it's not so much physical anymore, right?

170
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:11,560
But psychological, so, I think creating as much space for reducing that anxiety so like hey if something is you make a mistake I will bring it up in this way with you.

171
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:25,460
So that way they know what's coming or if it's you know this is what I expect like how much vacation time for you to take so that way they're not even worried about like oh it should I even ask for this or not, right?

172
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,960
I think it's just calling out those things and saying this is how I work.

173
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,060
Here's what I look like on.

174
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,860
Distress.

175
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,960
Here's what will happen.

176
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,360
If something goes wrong, this is how I am going to support you.

177
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:40,060
So, so just really kind of opening up that box of this is how I am going to support you.

178
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:46,160
This is how you can exploit, you can expect me to do, how you can expect me to react and just reduces that kind of magdala.

179
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,960
Feeling of like, oh, I don't know what's coming next, you do because I am going to help, hopefully clarify and tell you what's coming next.

180
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,860
I think that creates a lot of safety.

181
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:02,160
The other piece is really I hate giving you're trying not to be judgmental when someone's telling you something.

182
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:10,860
So that way, they can know that they can bring things to you, that you are going to partner with them, to talk through, whatever it is, that they're going through, whether that is personal or not.

183
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,760
And sometimes, you know, we're not therapists or most of us are not there because people managers.

184
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,160
So there's a line there for sure, but it goes a long way to even just listen and empathize with like, okay.

185
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:29,860
Yeah, your kid can't go to daycare right now because there's a covid outbreak and you probably We are so distracted.

186
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,960
So let us talk about what we can do to help you kind of threw that piece.

187
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,460
It's huge.

188
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:46,960
Amy Elizabeth, is you have anything to say, regarding psychological safety, or even the previous question about, how managers can create an environment of relationship building?

189
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,960
Yeah, it I think that so many good points.

190
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,060
Thanks so much for sharing video.

191
00:36:54,060 --> 00:37:02,660
I think that the one thing I would add on the psychological safety front is also showing vulnerability yourself as a manager or a leader.

192
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:19,560
I think that can also go a long way and I think you know, so often we as managers and leaders think like we're supposed to sort of appear to have it all together, and we're supposed to have all of the answers, and we don't you know we don't want to bring up a topic and You know, exactly how to respond.

193
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:26,460
And it's just this sort of myth of management and Leadership that is what our people want from us.

194
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:35,060
When in fact, so much of relationships and human connection comes down to our shared Humanity, which is that we are fragile.

195
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:41,760
You know, people who have struggles and aspirations, and things that we're dealing with as well.

196
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,860
And so, you know, I think as much as possible creating space, you know, too.

197
00:37:47,960 --> 00:38:23,160
To be able to, to not only hear from the employee but also to share, when it's been a hard time or I have got to take off early, to go be with my kids or, you know, some of that I think makes it safe because often what I hear and what I see is that we as, as managers and leaders can feel like we are open to people giving us all of the feedback and all of the information, and we might even ask the question, but if we never see leaders role, Modeling it in then the sort of subtext is.

198
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,360
It's not safe to share that here.

199
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:34,960
So that's one thing that has been a big learning for me, personally, is just the power of sharing.

200
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,460
You know, that two-way dialogue a couple other just quick things.

201
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:52,060
I will add that kind of just piggyback on what Vicky was sharing as well is that you know there's just one of my kind of Monitors this to try to, you know, create meaning in the things we're already doing.

202
00:38:52,060 --> 00:39:02,460
So like one-on-ones are often just kind of firefighting to do's and it's so easy to get in that trap, but really making sure that you are once a month.

203
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:10,660
Creating space for that like deeper conversation and it's all like the power of great questions is always something.

204
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,960
You know, like having those teed up, I think is so important because you can always do the small talk.

205
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,860
You can always do the firefighting but it's the like really going deep.

206
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:26,760
Are one really powerful question that, especially after the pandemic, I found had a huge impact was asking, how are you doing?

207
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:49,260
And then stopping and saying, no, really how are you doing and pausing and being quiet and letting people share and that's where some of those other challenges that you know, just people can't shut off as soon as they turn on their computer can come up but then also asking meaningful questions that like get to our aspirations in the Workplace things.

208
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,460
One of my favorite questions is.

209
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,760
When do you think this is the best job for you?

210
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,560
And when do you think it's not?

211
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,260
That can just open up a world of like here is where I am so energized.

212
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:14,760
And here's this thing that just drains me and makes me feel like I am not doing my best work and that the, the data that gives you a lot as a manager allows you to then, you know, really start to, to cater to what is unique for this individual.

213
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,860
And by the way, very often, those answers could be very different for every person.

214
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,660
Not the team.

215
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:24,660
So you know I think so often what we want is to not just be one other person on the team.

216
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:42,260
One number, we want to be seen as humans and so as much as you can, facilitate questions that really get to that deeper connection than I think, you know, a lot of things start to naturally happen in your so much more empowered as a manager to really have a positive impact on your people.

217
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,160
Yeah, I love everything that you both have said.

218
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:53,760
I think just to add to this kind of question of, you know, how to create psychological safety.

219
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,060
I think building on Amy's point about powerful questions.

220
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:06,360
You know, one of the things that we also know really works is this process of active listening and part of that process is asking questions.

221
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,660
But part of it is repeating back.

222
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,260
What you think?

223
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,760
You have heard to someone just kind of pausing and saying okay.

224
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:25,860
This is this what you're saying, which is an incredibly powerful tool for to Amy's Point making people really feel heard and seen and creating that sense of safety.

225
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:31,860
Because you can really feel assured that somebody's listening to you, they understand where you're coming from.

226
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,860
And if you don't, if you don't get it right, then, there's that.

227
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,260
Powerful.

228
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,760
Question of, can you help me understand what I am missing?

229
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:43,760
Right, and I think that too, and we think about how do you, you know, kind of create those.

230
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:51,160
Conditions of psychological safety can be really powerful and also can help teach you as a manager, right?

231
00:41:51,160 --> 00:42:00,860
Like what you might be missing or what you're what, you're not totally understanding about the person in front of you and reveal some of the assumptions that you might have in those interactions.

232
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,060
So I think it's kind of win-win in that sense.

233
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,960
So good.

234
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:14,960
I see an up voted question under Q&A Katie, if you can pull that first question up, I think it's related.

235
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:23,860
But now from the employees perspective, the question is, how do I develop a good relationship with a new manager remotely?

236
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:32,460
So now then remote brings on another layer and this is from the employee perspective manage, you know, trying to build the relationship with their manager.

237
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,060
What are your thoughts to this question?

238
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:48,760
Most of my team is actually remote, and I think This goes back to the I often find we ask these questions or will go to HR and ask these questions.

239
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,060
And like, we will have you asked your manager?

240
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,860
I have you ask the employee yet, and I am like, no.

241
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,660
Not yet.

242
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:55,660
Go talk.

243
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,760
Go talk about it.

244
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,360
There's no right or wrong answer here.

245
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,260
And I think it's like, hey manager.

246
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,860
I would love to develop a relationship with you.

247
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,160
This is typically how I have done it.

248
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,760
I am curious.

249
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:14,760
Like what can we do together to, to do better there and, and I think it's Lucky that in.

250
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,460
And this might say something about my hiring practices.

251
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,660
I have to look into that, but most of my team is very relationships, based on strengths finder.

252
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:29,860
So naturally we will, we have conversations, we know, kind of what generates connections on our team and so, we will do more of that.

253
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:40,760
I make my one-on-ones extra-long now because the conversations I would typically have maybe just randomly in the hallway or because our desks are next to each other, don't happen anymore.

254
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:46,360
So I am going to make sure that happens, and we even have just It's a monthly hangout that we keep on the calendar.

255
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:57,460
We can have lunch together and just talk about just, you know, sit around and talk but I think, you know if you have got a new manager, and they haven't done any of those things yet, it's bringing it up with them.

256
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:03,060
You know, saying, hey, if and if there's a problem already like, it's making me feel a little bit isolated.

257
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,060
I don't feel connected, is there stuff we could do that.

258
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:15,860
I think that can at least generate more conversation and then idea building from not just you, but then two to the two of you Iran, how to do that better?

259
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:20,560
Or if you have got colleagues that you can already trust, always great to run things by people.

260
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,560
I don't think we crowdsource enough information and that can be super useful.

261
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,960
So, first things first, I think to start the conversation and see where it goes.

262
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,060
Yeah, I love that.

263
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,560
I know it's funny.

264
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,360
I always really big on.

265
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,560
We need our managers to like start this conversation because it can be so intimidating.

266
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,760
As you know, you come into this organization and you're trying to do these things and like, and you don't know what's.

267
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,560
Okay, and what's not, okay.

268
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,260
And so I have like four questions.

269
00:44:50,260 --> 00:45:03,060
I ask any time, I have a new employee start on my team and all of them have been remote for me, for the last probably six or seven years, because I work remotely for a while, and I was just reading through them and thinking whether I should share them or not.

270
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:08,460
And I actually think you could flip them is If your manager doesn't ask these that you could actually flip them, and they could still be productive.

271
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,760
So I will just share them really quickly.

272
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:31,460
So, first one on one, I have with a new employee, I first asked about their family and like, what's important to them and what I try to just you know, get a little bit of like they're their life like who are the people you're working for or most important relationship smoothie and your life and then you know also just kind of asked about like, what times were Work for you.

273
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,960
What's like the ideal?

274
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:41,960
You know, ideal Cadence because everybody, I seem to work with these days is pretty worried about work-life balance and like, trying to draw boundaries, especially if they're working remotely for the first time.

275
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,460
So we will kind of talk about some of that personal stuff, then I will say fast-forward to a year in the future.

276
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,160
You're thinking, I love this job.

277
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,260
I am so happy.

278
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,860
I feel so successful.

279
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,560
I am really happy.

280
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,960
I made this move like what are the conditions that made you make you feel that way?

281
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:06,160
So often when people join a company they have this like you know, really A sort of like true north and big picture of what they see, and they want to be with this company for a long time.

282
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,160
So I try to kind of get some of that out.

283
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,160
Then I asked, what are you most excited about?

284
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,760
And what are you most nervous about?

285
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,960
And the nervous one is really helpful to me, because then I can like nowhere, I need to lean in more and support them.

286
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,360
And then I will ask like, what are the qualities of the best manager for you and what doesn't work?

287
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,760
But yeah, I was just thinking I share that because I think there's some of those questions you could ask.

288
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:38,760
About, like, if I am the employee and the manager, you could say fast-forward a year in the future and you're so happy that you hired me, like, what has happened?

289
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,060
What does that look like?

290
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:43,160
Or you know, what are you manager?

291
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,060
Most excited about with me starting.

292
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,560
What are you nervous about?

293
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,860
What are the things that are top of mind for you?

294
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:56,460
So I can help you support them, but I always find that I need like 90 minutes for that first conversation because we get into a lot of (Rich) dialogue.

295
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,960
Could you drop those questions in chat?

296
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,560
Oh yeah.

297
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,560
It's a Polish them a little bit there.

298
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:06,560
Yep.

299
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,760
I would also say just to kind of build on this theme of question.

300
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:21,660
Asking one thing that's really interesting about this, is that there's actually quite a lot of evidence about why question asking works so well, to build relationships.

301
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,060
So, I don't know if folks are familiar with.

302
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:42,360
There was a New York Times article several years ago, 36 questions to fall in love, and it was based on This research by psychologist or there, Aaron who developed questions to help create Kind of intimacy and like relationship closeness in a lab, right?

303
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:53,260
And the idea being that questions, really helped create this environment of mutual vulnerability and that, that's what really makes people feel closer to each other.

304
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,660
So you know, it makes sense that across different context.

305
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,660
When we're asking people questions, I share a little bit about myself.

306
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:09,160
You share a little bit about yourself, and we kind of continue to get closer in that way as we reveal kind of more about each other.

307
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:17,760
So I think those questions that the Amy mentioned, you know, could also set the foundation for other questions.

308
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:29,160
You know, later on as you develop that relationship, that maybe get a little bit, even more into, kind of who you are, as people, what your values are what you're doing outside of work great.

309
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,860
But there's just one kind of bring that in as well.

310
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,860
And that's a really good.

311
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,260
It's a really good article to.

312
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,960
We can drop the link in there in case folks.

313
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,560
Haven't Just drop it.

314
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,560
Oh great.

315
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,860
Awesome in chat.

316
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,360
That's awesome.

317
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:53,160
Wow, there's like so much Rich information in the data behind this as well with some of these insights that my mind is processing a lot.

318
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:59,060
And in fact I would like to bring up one of the questions that came up about.

319
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,560
It's the second one Katie.

320
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:05,260
How do you communicate and interact well with difficult colleagues?

321
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,260
I am open to new ways to approach this challenge.

322
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:16,360
So I have seen some of that in chat as well, you know if there is a difficult period Where do you start?

323
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,160
I can, I can share some thoughts.

324
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:47,860
I mean, I think there's like some level of also just sort of knowing when someone's opened and with their dad and sometimes like there're some relationships where people just they're looking for something different in terms of what they come to work to get and there might be other things that are like, leading to that.

325
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:52,960
So, just trying to like, lead with curiosity, but also be aware when it might not be a relief.

326
00:49:53,160 --> 00:50:04,360
Check that is going to go beyond, you know, the day-to-day one of my new favorite questions is what would need to be true for dot.

327
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:10,460
So, you know if you felt like there was a colleague where we're struggling to work together.

328
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:22,160
Well, like perhaps a question, like what would need to be true for you to feel like we're collaborating really well or, you know, you're getting what you need from me or you know, something along those lines.

329
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:30,760
To kind of get into some of the way that they're thinking about the relationship, and they might be like, things are great.

330
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:43,460
I don't have any challenges here or well, you know, I just feel like I need to like, really get down to business more quickly or you like there could be, there could be so many things and I think it's just really hard to guess.

331
00:50:43,460 --> 00:51:01,060
And, so I think coming from a place of, I really want us to have a great working relationship and then you know, asking them what Yes, you can do could potentially give some insight that you just wouldn't be able to guess on your own.

332
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:11,860
First one is I love that Amy and it also reminds me of, and I am not sure the specific context that this person is asking about.

333
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:20,060
But I do think in times when you are maybe disagreeing on something or have two different perspectives kind of coming Head to Head.

334
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:28,260
Another interesting question is What would, what would you have to learn for you to change your mind?

335
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:37,560
And, you know, I think that's an interesting one, too, because it can help you get a sense of is this person open or not to that kind of first point that Amy was making.

336
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:48,360
Sometimes folks really might not be open to engaging in might be pretty, you know, stuck on what they think is true, or you know what they think is the way forward and that's fine.

337
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,560
But then that also gets to this question of what is going to be within your control and what's outside of your Troll.

338
00:51:53,560 --> 00:52:06,060
And so, I think that there are certain aspects of a relationship where to save yourself kind of that emotional, you know, involvement recognizing kind of what the boundaries are.

339
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:11,060
What you're actually going to be able to change in that other person or in your inner relationship.

340
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:26,660
But I love that perspective of leading with curiosity and really trying to understand the actual kind of kinship that you have first and kind of dive into some of your assumptions.

341
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:33,160
And what they kind of think is true and what might be better than well as a starting place.

342
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:49,460
Yeah, and I Dad if you can, I have seen this work, a couple of times as find someone, you know, a coach or a mentor started to talk through this with is even better if you can kind of find someone who you think may be.

343
00:52:49,760 --> 00:53:07,260
If the pain point is around, maybe the way you communicate or the way you think through things, finding someone that might think in that same way to get an idea of like it gave, this were you, what would, what would be some of that reaction because maybe there's something I am missing here and Why we keep butting heads or whatever, it is.

344
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:23,060
My husband's very different from me, and we act, I constantly use him for a lot of this stuff because he just thinks and processes kind of the same situation in a different way and it helps me catch stuff that I may not catch and then it's also a safe space to have that conversation.

345
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:30,360
So you can also process I think what you're feeling because I imagine as you go into the conversation, there's already probably emotions coming up to.

346
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:37,560
So it's hard to maybe step sometimes back and say okay I have Saying this between the two of us, like how can we fix this?

347
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:42,060
Because now we're just both frustrated in it and kind of maybe angry or something.

348
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:48,160
So, finding ways to step back a little bit, you know, look at kind of what you're reacting to and why.

349
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,160
So that way, you can figure out what their response kind of is or me.

350
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,360
What's going through their mind?

351
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:59,660
I would say huge plus, 1 to the coach or Mentor being able to help with this.

352
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:33,660
I personally have a coach who has helped me with A couple of conversations recently and one of the Frameworks that she shared as well is just kind of the ability to talk about if you are talking about a particular situation to really clearly articulate like the facts of the situation, and then the impact and the, the story you might be telling yourself as well about kind of why something why you think something happened and so detaching.

353
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:42,060
It If you can from your own assumptions or even just making those assumptions really clear, sure the person.

354
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,160
So, this is what I saw happen.

355
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,260
These are the facts.

356
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,060
This was the impact that I saw that have kind of objectively.

357
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,960
And this is why I may be, I think this happened or why you know that this is a story I am telling myself.

358
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,360
So and I think Amy you're probably familiar with that too.

359
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:07,460
I think it's it comes from some folks who Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

360
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:25,760
But I think that can also be a great way to share and a way to kind of again, try to not necessarily let your assumptions or your emotions kind of completely drive the conversation.

361
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,060
Not easy.

362
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,160
No, not easy at all.

363
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,160
To your coach and mentorship point.

364
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:44,560
What if someone is looking for a good coach or Mentor, like, where do they start to find identify a strong relationship like that?

365
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:53,160
Yeah, so I think one great place to start is, you know, a torch.

366
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,560
We do facilitate those relationships with folks.

367
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:03,560
So we have a network of many hundreds of coaches and thousands of mentors.

368
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,160
And I think what can be really great about that.

369
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:15,560
Are you end up in some cases getting paired with somebody who maybe is not?

370
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:28,260
Ready at your organization and can kind of offer that different perspectives at the same time, I think there can be a lot of value in finding somebody in your organization and being able to kind of learn from that person.

371
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:35,160
That's maybe a level or two above you, and that person kind of helping you grow in that and that role.

372
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:47,260
But I think there are, you know, they're both kind of formal ways to go about finding a coach or Mentor, maybe through like a Platform or a program.

373
00:56:47,960 --> 00:57:00,360
But then, you know, I think there's a lot to be said for identifying a person in your organization or maybe in your broader Network and, and suggesting to that person.

374
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,560
Hey, I really admire you, I really admire the work that you're doing.

375
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:18,260
Would you consider having a conversation with me every month or so or every couple weeks when I would be asking some questions and you don't necessarily if it makes you feel strange or awkward, you don't have done Really frame it in terms of like, will you be my mentor, right?

376
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,060
It can kind of evolved into that.

377
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:24,460
I know I have talked to some people who have told me like, well that sounds really weird.

378
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:31,460
I want to just ask somebody to be my mentor you know but you can take a lot of the strategies that we were talking about earlier about.

379
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,460
How do you start to build a relationship with someone, right?

380
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,160
So I think it's the same thing.

381
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:45,460
Here can kind of start slow and start by telling that person why they matter to you and why you are impressed with them and why you want to learn with them which I think can go.

382
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,560
A long way.

383
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:56,860
But really kind of starting to identify who are the people that I want to work with or who are the people that I kind of admire and why and what might I want to learn from them.

384
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:57,260
And how am I?

385
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:03,560
What I want to model those types of relationships but would love to hear from Amy and Vicki to how they think about that?

386
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,560
Vicky's anything else that you would share?

387
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,860
I don't think anything extra.

388
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,860
It's yeah.

389
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:20,560
Just kind of reinforcing everything y'all were saying too yeah.

390
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:34,860
And I mean, you know, we a lot more companies are offering coaching benefits, and so I think even if yours does not, you know, sharing asking your HR business partner or a leader like is there.

391
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:35,960
Some do we offer?

392
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,160
Like this is there anyone that you would recommend is good to?

393
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:46,360
I sometimes think for especially if you're new to an organization, you know, finding the hardest part, is finding the person.

394
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:56,460
And so, you know, that's the power of the network and part of white towards exist is because we want to make it easier for people to find those connections.

395
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:01,060
So, just would encourage sharing and looking into those types of benefits.

396
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:03,360
That's great to know.

397
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,560
So we have got believe or not, 15 minutes left.

398
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:09,160
So I want to start tackling some of these questions in queue.

399
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:31,060
A we have one that's upvoted, pretty high with the world shifting more and more digital, what more can should companies do for those who prefer an in-person work environment, especially for people, earlier on in their careers, that is such a good question.

400
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,360
And an Engineering Management.

401
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,960
Came to me, he's like, Vicki, I think we need two ships counselor.

402
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:42,260
He's a Star Trek fan, so he's saying we need a Deanna Troi, and I was like, all right, tell me more.

403
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:47,860
We started talking through all this stuff, and we realize what we're actually we brought in another manager Iranians of employees.

404
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:59,560
And we all had this discussion has been going on for months now of like, you know what we actually want is in person connection, and we are trying to mimic it as good as we can and is virtual environment.

405
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:00,860
But it is hard.

406
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:07,360
We are on when you're on resume call or meet call or teens, call all day long, you don't want to be on that screen anymore.

407
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:14,460
And so what we have been talking about is actually, all right, if we do this all company get together once a year.

408
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,060
What's the half-life of that?

409
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:22,360
Can it be kind of boosted in other ways we virtual events, and then, when do we need to get together again?

410
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,560
And then at what, what size is it?

411
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,760
Just our own team.

412
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,560
So manager and their direct team.

413
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,560
Is it, maybe the department coming together?

414
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,060
So we're still figuring a lot.

415
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,360
That out but one thing we're actually going to test.

416
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:43,260
So I can't tell you if it's going to work or not, but we have a hypothesis is we haven't really been doing kind of get togethers around like an affinity topic.

417
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:46,060
So we do these social hours right?

418
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,160
And it's like, okay everyone get together.

419
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:56,860
Most of our virtual events are in there cooking or trivia or some kind of show like one of those three things lately and so you get the same people kind of going to all those things.

420
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:01,960
So now we're like well, what if we did one where hey crocheters Knitters come?

421
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:02,960
Grab your stuff.

422
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,060
Come hang out for an hour.

423
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:04,960
We're just going to get on Zoom.

424
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,860
You're going to work on, whatever it is.

425
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:06,560
You're going to work on it.

426
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:12,460
We're going to talk because we realized because the four or five of us out cared so much about the ship's counselor topic.

427
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:18,160
We have begun closer because we have these conversations and there's a topic to be discussed.

428
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:26,360
So we're going to actually try this with kind of more things and maybe I will be like a video game night or something like that and see kind of how that goes.

429
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,960
So I don't think I have got an answer yet, but there's a whole lot of stuff that we're going to test to see if this works.

430
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:35,360
I love that.

431
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,560
I love that afraid.

432
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,460
He topic groups.

433
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,560
Yeah.

434
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,160
Yeah, it's you really well.

435
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:46,160
I have lots of opinions on this but I think it's important like contextually.

436
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:51,560
Every organization is definitely different and has different set of circumstances at torch.

437
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,560
We are remote first at this point.

438
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,960
Most of our growth has happened since the pandemic.

439
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:04,060
And so most of our teammates have basically joined Julie and stayed virtually.

440
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:16,060
We do have a few hubs and regions where we have a concentration of people, and we still have a little bit of office presents, but we're at the point now where that's kind of all we do.

441
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:26,360
But to the point of the question, I mean, you know, I think everyone a lot of people actually my head of recruiting always tells me one of the first questions people often ask is, are you really remote?

442
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:35,160
And that's like there are people that really want this and even those of us who really like working remotely Like and I really want to see human beings at some point.

443
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:41,660
So I think that largely what I am seeing is everyone's realizing is that it's not either/or.

444
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:47,960
It's really, how do you kind of facilitate both things, and so I will just share one thing that we're.

445
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,160
So we're given that we're remote.

446
01:02:50,160 --> 01:03:05,660
First were thinking about how do we really put some systems around getting together and seeing other human beings in person, it naturally happens in the places where we had office space but It's everywhere else where it's not naturally happening.

447
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:17,260
And so outside of to Vicki's point the org-wide Retreat, and then we also do functional or like smaller team retreats in between we are working on.

448
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:27,360
We have not figured out exactly how to structure this yet, but we're working on trying to make it easy for people to get together with others in their area, grab lunch, or if they're traveling.

449
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,760
Be able to Ping people that are in the Chicago area and say I am in town.

450
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,260
Anyone want to go grab dinner?

451
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:47,960
And actually like having some funds associated with that, that were actively encouraging it because very often those like one-on-one I live in a place where, like, I have had several people have come in and out to visit go skiing or something.

452
01:03:47,960 --> 01:04:12,960
And I mean, I remember the lunch that I had with this person or the coffee that I grabbed, this other person in a way that I sometimes, can't remember what meetings I was on, you know, all week, but I will remember and actually there's a lot of research around the way our brain works and that sort of spatial change can actually help things to stick in a way that being on the same, you know, computer screen, like it starts to just really run together.

453
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:26,760
So, we want to look for those like serendipitous put a little bit of structure behind it, but let people, you know, find each other and find those clusters again, we haven't figured out exactly to structure that because it gets really complicated and the funding of it and the policy and all of that.

454
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,560
But we know there's something there.

455
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:31,460
I love that.

456
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:34,960
It was serendipitous moments and changing the environment.

457
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,260
It's good.

458
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:39,760
Is there anything else?

459
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,460
Elizabeth would you add?

460
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,160
I don't think I would add anything else.

461
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,560
I think they covered it.

462
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,360
I would just say that this is a, it's a challenging thing.

463
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:52,460
And I think I don't know any organization that really feels like they have figured it out.

464
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,260
So I was just kind of validate.

465
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:58,960
The fact that everybody, if you're feeling confused going through this, I think you're not.

466
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,760
You're not alone.

467
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:13,760
Let us go on to this next question, here, how can you scale relationship building processes programs and events within a company from small departments across company-wide?

468
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:34,260
Yeah, so I think one of the first things that I would say here is relationship kind of relationship building program is one that can really help to scale those efforts.

469
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:40,660
So for instance, a mentorship program rate is one where you have some formality around.

470
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:49,460
How people are paired up, for instance, and then maybe there's some guiding questions you have a past that you're kind of being gay.

471
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:50,260
It through.

472
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:54,960
So it's not quite as much to you as either the mentor and the mentee to figure out.

473
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,860
What am I doing?

474
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,360
How does this thing even work?

475
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:02,760
But you're kind of really LED through that process and hopefully that's going to lead to better outcomes for you.

476
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:14,360
And that also means that if it is an organizational by program, you might get an opportunity to meet with and talk to people from different parts of the organization different functions.

477
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:23,560
So really kind of creating that type of relationship building that might not happen organically which can be really, really powerful.

478
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:39,660
So I think that's, that's one thing that I would share that can really be useful and kind of scaling up some of those processes and making it so that it's not just on the onus of or it's not the onus isn't just on individual managers to do all this work individual employees.

479
01:06:44,660 --> 01:07:05,560
I can add a couple of quick thoughts, one, when I think about sort of larger team size, something that, that is a really simple intervention that I love is something that I call question of the day and it's just starting out every meeting every like team meeting or formal meeting.

480
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,060
So, not necessarily a huge group at sometimes.

481
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:10,360
Well, actually even do it in the chat and our company.

482
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,060
All Hands.

483
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,860
That's just a completely non-work-related.

484
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:14,960
Added question.

485
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:17,360
That is just fun.

486
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:40,860
I have like a spreadsheet of questions that will ask that, just kind of can get people talking and sharing and sometimes I have some crazy stories of how that's like turned into US learning about something that someone, you know, someone turns out that there are musicians, and they have this amazing talent, and then they share the video that they made and then suddenly like Elite one thing leads to another and you just know someone at a much deeper level.

487
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:53,460
And I think we just I always try to think with HR programs and interventions like, just enough to help people do the right thing and it doesn't need to be this huge program, but just like plant the question and then see what happens.

488
01:07:54,260 --> 01:08:00,660
Another thing I will add is a technology that we just invested in, which is a, a start-up that's called whisk.

489
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:23,359
And it's w is q and it is essentially their mission is all around bringing more life to work and it is essentially kind of like this combination of Instagram and Pinterest but for The work environment where people can post pictures and share ideas or like a funny podcast that they listen to and people can comment on it.

490
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:30,560
There're groups and boards that you can join if you're interested in pets or woodworking or knitting or whatever that might be.

491
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:37,359
And you know, so we're trying to kind of to Vicki's point about around like getting together to work on a common interest.

492
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:51,260
We're trying to kind of create a place for those things to Bubble Up and populate, and They have a lot of cool things on their road map to where they're going to like create lounges and kind of version of donut dates that people can do through virtual interaction.

493
01:08:52,260 --> 01:09:12,760
It's a there's just trying to we're trying to it doesn't solve the like need for in person but again if you can start to see people outside of their title and there, there's a new screen that can often lead to just these connection points that get people together more, and get them seeing each other as more.

494
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:20,859
Then just, you know, that, that product manager, that keeps telling me, no, or that HR person that keeps asking me to do this thing.

495
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,359
And so we're trying to just find a lot of different ways to do that.

496
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:26,560
Yeah.

497
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:31,560
I think a lot of this is also, you know, do you have someone who can own creating this or not?

498
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,460
And if so, then what is the remit for that?

499
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:38,460
Like what, you know, what are you trying to accomplish from a program wide level?

500
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:55,060
Because that does require budget, it does require someone to kind of drive it forward and I have noticed when we have tried to do some things that are like overly consistent, it almost Burns people out, and they don't want to do it anymore, which is you think about how we interact in life, it's very organic and kind of just comes and goes and Ebbs and flows.

501
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,460
And so how do we create more of that?

502
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,360
And I think a lot of it goes back to Leading by example to.

503
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:07,060
So we have donut installed in our slack to kind of create those conversations with each other.

504
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,760
To create those questions.

505
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:12,760
I set, slack reminders, in my own team, meetings of like, you know, what are you excited?

506
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,160
About for the weekend, it comes out on Friday.

507
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:22,460
What, you know what are you looking forward to getting done on Monday and just trying to Pepper things in like that?

508
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:31,460
We even do things were randomly someone might say in the plant Channel like, hey show us your favorite plant today or in the Dog Channel.

509
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:31,860
Alright.

510
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:41,260
It's Friday afternoon with the animals and it's just a spontaneous moment that we try to generate and encourage other people to do random things.

511
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:54,760
So to Generate some of that and I think it's it is a little bit difficult but just trying to find different ways and just creative ideas and just trying it and if it does is you do it once.

512
01:10:54,760 --> 01:11:00,060
And that's it, I don't think there's anything wrong with that because again goes back to the ebbing and flowing of that's how we talk.

513
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:20,760
Speaking of Select channels, our team just started a social yell slack Channel where all you can do is type in all caps and it is probably one of the funnest slack channels that you have currently peopled are like, happy Monday and it's like shouting at you, right?

514
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:25,660
That's so fun.

515
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:30,360
I am speaking of slack, the one thing that I want to call out, this may be a less.

516
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:41,560
Exciting scaling opportunity but one that I think is really important, and we were kind of getting at the beginning to is just the consistency of communications, right?

517
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:53,260
Like I think just if you have a team, making sure that you're responding to people on slack or just kind of doing simple things every day that lead to more trust in relationships.

518
01:11:53,260 --> 01:12:20,660
So I think there's this aspect of it that can be more formal and kind of more planned right around some of these amazing questions that I am beginning even bringing up but then there's also just if my manager responds to me in a timely way that's going to also impact how I feel about my relationship with them or if I am in a meeting with them, and they hear me, and they support an idea, or they kind of give me space to speak about an idea.

519
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:23,160
That's also going to really impact my relationship with them.

520
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:30,460
So I think it's important to take into account some of those other smaller, like kind of micro behaviors to that happened throughout the day.

521
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:31,260
Additional.

522
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:39,860
And in addition to these kind of special relationship, building things that we might think about doing, So good.

523
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,760
We're already at time.

524
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,960
This topic has been so rich.

525
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:47,960

7
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Here for this event.

8
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,500
I mean, we're talking about remote work and so it's only makes sense to have remote distributed representation here.

9
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,100
Love, love to see it.

10
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:20,500
You know, I think that the beauty about we're going to get into a lot of the beauty about remote work, but it's a lot of it is to represent it just by even what you're seeing here in chat.

11
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:29,200
Today, we're going to cover a lot of cool things and insights on what's happening in the remote work World, both personally for us.

12
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,500
Us in the market and into the future, you know?

13
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,400
Today I am actually joining you guys from Philadelphia that's my hometown.

14
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,300
However, I am living and I have moved since the pandemic to Puerto Rico so give me those to all you guys doing from there as well.

15
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,700
Quick housekeeping.

16
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:52,600
This is I know it's different platform for some of you folks, but we're going to have a strong emphasis on Q&A.

17
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:59,300
We have two amazing speakers there in the green room right now, they're going to join me on stage, and we want to have a conversation with all of you.

18
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,300
So ask questions come up.

19
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,200
As we get into these topics, please.

20
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,400
Please drop your question in the Q&A tab, on the right-hand side.

21
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:15,400
If you need any help with, like exploring the platform and such get the help tab on the right-hand side and somebody who love to show you around.

22
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,400
Now, let us go ahead and set the stage set, the table per se.

23
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,800
Why are we here today?

24
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,600
Well, outside of hearing from two phenomenal leaders in the remote work space.

25
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:39,300
We're here today because We're all being impacted whether professionally or personally by the shift that's happening and the shift that's automatically shifting how we work in changing, how we work.

26
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:47,300
You know, a couple weeks ago, I was in a gathering with other leaders in business and I joined this breakout session.

27
00:07:47,400 --> 00:08:08,500
It was titled remote hybrid or in the office and the room was packed to the walls and I grabbed a see in the middle of the room because I needed it to listen to this conversation and you I felt the tension in the air, you know, this is like polarizing perspectives that some folks carry about where things should be at.

28
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:19,000
Is it in the office is a hybrid is a remote the pros and cons of it all and depending on where you stand, it can be very polarising today though, we're diving into the beauty of remote work.

29
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Why it works?

30
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,700
How companies that get it, right?

31
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,600
Have an unfair advantage and what that means into the future.

32
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:32,600
Now before we kick that off about, why don't we kick off with a quick poll to just quickly pull the audience here.

33
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,700
Today, just would love to understand, where are you working?

34
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,200
Primarily today?

35
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Is it primarily remote, primarily hybrid in office sometimes remote at home sometimes or just purely in the office?

36
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,400
We have a lot of remote only representation here today which is, which is great to see.

37
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
Which is pretty.

38
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,000
It makes sense.

39
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,300
Right?

40
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,500
The topics that were covering.

41
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,800
Good to see that.

42
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,500
Looks like a 60% remote only audience here.

43
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
So, good to see it.

44
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,300
Now, I am gonna go ahead and get a little bit of speakers.

45
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,600
Backgrounds, it covered.

46
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,400
So maybe let me get myself out the way.

47
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:21,100
So again, my name is Roberto and welcome is on a mission to help companies change the way they gather engage and Inspire their remote control.

48
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:27,200
He's, we are fully remote company, and we're doing the technology to empower the distributed Workforce.

49
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,400
Now, Tony Jamis who's joining us as well.

50
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,800
He is the co-founder and CEO of oyster.

51
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:57,400
If you have not learned about what you need to learn about oyster, they're changing the way you recruit and connect with employees around the world, he is an again, he is the founder and CEO of oyster and there are Global and Schmidt platforms that empowers companies higher pay and care for their teammates regardless of where they are, Tony is also a future of work activists.

52
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Are we going to get into that in a minute?

53
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:05,800
Passionate about the global benefits of distributed work and how that's changing worldwide.

54
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:12,200
And how that's the impact that's having on both people and the economy and Chris heard?

55
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,500
He's the founder and CEO of First Base.

56
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:37,700
You probably seen both of these guys, flooding your Twitter, and/or your LinkedIn because I know I always tune in whenever these guys are posting and Chris leads first base, which is a hard word as a service platform that enables companies to set up manage and retrieve all physical equipment of remote workers and their needs.

57
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Chris, founded first based on the belief that everyone should have more time with the people that care about most all while doing their best work.

58
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,200
So guys, Why don't you guys put it together and chat?

59
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,900
Give it up for both Chris and Tony who's joining us here on stage.

60
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,200
Anyone Tony Chris, good to see you guys?

61
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,300
Hey, thanks for joining us.

62
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,000
First of all, I think, you know, we were just talking about in The Green Room.

63
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,600
I have been looking forward to this conversation quite a bit.

64
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,600
I have gotten to know you guys and different levels as well.

65
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:25,600
But to have this representation on stage to talk about remote work, I can't think about two other people besides you two to drive the conversation.

66
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,500
So, thank you for being here.

67
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,000
Well, thank you for welcoming us on the welcome platform.

68
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,400
Yeah, absolutely.

69
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So really quick.

70
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,400
Small fun fact as well.

71
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,000
You know doing some background on both of you guys.

72
00:11:42,900 --> 00:12:04,600
We all live in different parts of the world, and we call home to different parts of the world, and we all live on an island in different parts of the world which is really fascinating you know, home for me is Puerto Rico Chris, you're in Scotland and Tony you in Cyprus in the middle of the Mediterranean which is In to see that, you know, I talk to people all the time.

73
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:11,400
I would never thought my wife and I always dreamed of going back to Puerto Rico and I will, we stop that.

74
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,800
I can't do that because I am building a tech company.

75
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,500
I am trying to progress my tech sort of career.

76
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:23,600
And here we are right doing that living where we want to live and building what we want to do build.

77
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,900
So in the core of our conversation you know we're going to be breaking up our conversation into three pillars.

78
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:36,500
Number one is the A personal impact of remote work and how to get that right for ourselves.

79
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,400
And what we're seeing is best practices because we know the shift to remote work.

80
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:52,900
It starts with us personally, I do, we have the right things in place for us to succeed personally, as we take on remote work, number two, the impact and the market, that remote work is having on the market.

81
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:58,300
And the, lastly, how is remote work shaping the future and those are the three key areas.

82
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,100
So don't, why don't we kick off with the first one?

83
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,800
Which is Around the personal impact of remote work.

84
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:17,300
So, with all that I already covered is pretty clear to say that we're all Champions over about work outside of building companies, for remote work, outside of building distributed teams.

85
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,900
We're also impacted personally by remote work.

86
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,100
So, just the first question.

87
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,500
How has remote work impacted both of you on a personal level?

88
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,700
And if you can unpack that for us here today, Tony when we Compass here.

89
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:42,400
Yeah, so it's really gives gave me freedom and flexibility to design the life that I want to live.

90
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:57,300
So, starting from where I want to live to how I want to work, how much time I want to spend with my children, how much I want time, I spend on myself, so, so just to give you some examples of how I do this.

91
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:13,800
So as you mentioned, I live on the island of Cyprus, I have always thought Cyprus Was the most beautiful country in the world 17 years ago, when I was there and, and, and, and that opportunity enabled me to pick where I want to live in the world in a place that I want to call home.

92
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:25,700
I spent the last 40 years of my life, pretty much all my life living in cities, chasing job opportunities and in London and Bay Area and Paris and so on and so forth.

93
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,600
And I just, I am done with living in cities.

94
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't want to live in cities and for me, when I wanted to start this company, I It to work for me, first and foremost.

95
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,400
So it gave me a takes ability of location.

96
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:42,400
It gave me also the opportunity to design the life, I want to have.

97
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,800
So I don't work in the morning because most of my team is in Europe and in the u.s.

98
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,000
Time zone, so I work in the afternoon and in the evening.

99
00:14:50,400 --> 00:15:07,200
So I spent the morning with my children, exercising doing whatever I want to do and in the afternoon I have a one-hour where I can spend with my children On the beach to connect with them and then Friday we don't do meetings.

100
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,600
We called it focused Friday where it enables me to, to get stuff done.

101
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:12,800
That.

102
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,400
I need to get before going to the weekend, and then we completely disconnect over the weekend.

103
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,200
So but that cannot be possible.

104
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,600
If the organization doesn't allow that.

105
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,500
So we can talk about this.

106
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:34,800
Maybe later in the conversation is that it's it has to be something that is shared this way of living as See, this Freedom across the organization.

107
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,700
Yeah, let us get into that on the second half of this topic because I think that it's important to, I mean, we you just switch on remote.

108
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,200
It doesn't take care of all the problems.

109
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,400
It has to be wrapped in intention and discipline has to be part of that.

110
00:15:49,400 --> 00:16:05,000
But Chris fill us in on your remote sort of like how has it impacted you and by the way Tony and Chris are Super Active fathers, and they both have little babies right now as part of not just running a global company.

111
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,500
But also Raising kids and promote life, just changes that.

112
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,100
And so Chris, why don't you fill us in on that impact for you?

113
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:19,200
Yeah I think echoing well of for Tony said it was a quality life decision for me as well.

114
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,700
Miss. my first daughter walking laughing talking for the first time working in an office.

115
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,000
Had that question in my head which I remember having a conversation with my dad where I was like, this sucks.

116
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,200
Right?

117
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,800
Like, why am I missing the events to my kids lives?

118
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,600
He's like, that's how Oh, it's Gotta Be.

119
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,900
You gotta work to put a roof over your kids heads.

120
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,700
And I think for me it was like, well maybe it doesn't have to be like that.

121
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,900
And then founded my first business, we had a bunch of Discovery around all the challenges in operating that way.

122
00:16:48,900 --> 00:17:05,500
And then eventually we came to build first base and I think what's became important for me over the time between having that realization and today, and all the things I have done since then it's probably the realization that no other time in history, could I be doing what I am doing today.

123
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,599
We were speaking about this beforehand where we have raised a bunch of money from some of the most prominent investors in the world without ever stepping foot in San Francisco.

124
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:19,700
And until it was recently as two or three years ago, that would have been impossible.

125
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,099
And I think like, yeah, Tony speaks about this a lot, the ability to democratize access to opportunity is a huge part of this.

126
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:46,200
There are incredibly talented people all around the world and being able to give them access to the best opportunities globally is such A huge enabler, whether it's single parents whether it's people with health conditions or impairments, but there's people that Just Can't Get Right visa to work in some of the more affluent parts of the world.

127
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,400
So that's being the real driver for me, trying to make that change.

128
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:58,100
And obviously personally having that impact with my kids, my family while still being able to do the best work I have done in my life.

129
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Now that no doubt thanks to Sharon, and I like to jump in and add I was with what Chris said is that It also enabled me to reduce my carbon footprint and also great.

130
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,500
Gain more stability in my life.

131
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:24,400
So before starting this company, I was, I was a CEO of another company and used to spend half of my time every month in another continent.

132
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:33,600
I was in constant jet lag and when I took my transition to move this company, I run the numbers and see what's, what is my CO2 footprint?

133
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,700
And 90% of it was air travel.

134
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:43,500
And I want to be able to live and work and lead a successful company without the need to continuously be on a plane.

135
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,200
Now, in-person meetings are important, and we can touch base on why they are uncertain to make promote work.

136
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,500
But, but it has, it doesn't need to be the case to get stuff done.

137
00:18:53,500 --> 00:19:01,100
So you can massively reduce your carbon footprint as a human, when you work from remotely.

138
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,100
Yeah, yeah, no doubt, no doubt.

139
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,600
You know, it's interesting.

140
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:13,200
Now, every time I travel, I first always start with the question of why like, is this, this is this trip.

141
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,600
Really, really necessary.

142
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,200
And typically it's not.

143
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:24,200
And now, when you go into running a company and let us say, way into that, because Tony you touched on this first.

144
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,500
Second here, around being set up for success in a remote.

145
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:38,500
You know, remote first remove oriented sort of culture, you know, just one thing just today.

146
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,400
I am in Philadelphia, I am visiting family.

147
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:52,100
I have been out here for a couple of weeks, and I was just like, mind-boggled, because I was sitting in traffic and I typically don't sit in traffic to go to work.

148
00:19:52,100 --> 00:20:01,600
I am flipping anywhere, we walk into my office, and I am sitting there for an hour and it just Crazy.

149
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,300
Sort of like, I was taken aback by.

150
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,700
This was my normal for ten years.

151
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:22,300
I commute it two hours back and forth to work back in my early career, and I am glad that we don't have to do that but now as Leaders of companies and people managers and Chris you touch about this as well.

152
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:30,000
Like, you know, remote working remotely takes discipline, it takes attention, both discipline at the individual level, it takes attention.

153
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,400
In it takes trust leading with trust and assuming with trust.

154
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,500
What can companies do to help?

155
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,900
Like to help them succeed and to shift to remote?

156
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,100
Like if I am a people leader leading a team, and I am jumping into remote or my company just went remote friendly?

157
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,400
What are some of the things I could be doing to improve how we work remotely?

158
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,000
What are those things that come to mind for you guys?

159
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,600
Chris.

160
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,600
Yeah, this is a conversation.

161
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:09,400
I have had with everyone from exacts of global Banks to friends and family who live a globally.

162
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:18,400
And often the question I think becomes from an office first perspective, like how do you trust your people to do the work and the push back to?

163
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,100
That is really easy which is like you hire people without trusting them.

164
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,100
And like I think there's still a world in which that's true, right?

165
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:38,000
Like you spend all this time interviewing people, you check that they have these competencies and now you're not going to trust them to do the things that they want to do and I think to your point the commuting things I think Super interesting.

166
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:52,800
You look at that, the way we used to live as people spending 90% of their day getting ready for traveling to sitting in an office and by the time they get home, they have missed their kids, they leave before their kids.

167
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,800
Wake up, they got home after the kids have gone and bad their Partners exhausted.

168
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,100
They have got no time for friends.

169
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,300
Families and hobbies.

170
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And we wondered like, why are people not enjoying work?

171
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:12,700
Well, it's because they're sat in an office chair night and 5, and they don't have any time to do the things that make them happiest, which enables them to do, the best work that they have ever done in their lives.

172
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,000
And I think the final thing which I hear a law, which is how do we do it right?

173
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,500
Like, how do we do this thing?

174
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:27,500
We don't understand that and what typically that happens is, we're going to wrap Replicate the office remotely rather than leveraging, the benefits of remote.

175
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:35,400
And I think companies that begin remote, they maximize that they have more written culture, they communicate asynchronously more.

176
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:46,600
Tony, I spoke about the focus Friday, so carving out that time to do deep focus work without distractions, companies are just going to replicate the 925, they're going to track people's clicks.

177
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,700
They're never actually going to get any of the true benefit of remote work.

178
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,000
And I think getting over that hump and recognizing the status quo Me different.

179
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,700
That's maybe the two biggest things I see.

180
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:04,300
Yeah, the data you know was interesting Chris about that is 12 company's responsibility on.

181
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Putting these Frameworks in place you know, Freedom Fridays.

182
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,400
It was a focus Fridays.

183
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:25,100
It sounds like Freedom Fridays in my mind as well, freedom from meeting, but yes, but it's also like personally as an individual, I have to change as well, because if I, if I was already working 10 years and that was my Norm habitually.

184
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,600
I already, you know, running out the door.

185
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,800
This does this, do this.

186
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,100
Now I have control of my time.

187
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
What does that look like?

188
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,400
How do I put things in place?

189
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,000
That bring me life, that set me up.

190
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:49,500
Well, because for some people that commute and listening to Joe Rogan on the way to work, was there your transition from life to work and now us individually.

191
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,900
Working remotely, we have to build what works for us, and that takes some tension and it takes a lot of discipline to do that as well.

192
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,400
Tony, I know, Do you have a lot to say about this stuff as well?

193
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,500
We love to pull up to here.

194
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,700
Three things that I see a so company.

195
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,300
And we did as well as we adopted a successful remote work.

196
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,300
Model one is to intentionally build trust.

197
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:28,200
This is important because as you work remotely, you don't have these emotional signaling that come with body language and so it's harder to build trust in a remote environment.

198
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:34,000
So you need to be intentional and building trust it You part of our, one of the three values we have posters about.

199
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:55,200
What we do is we build trust and how we do it is by creating the maximum amount of safety, emotional safety for people not to be afraid to make mistakes, not to be afraid to say something wrong, is to be there for people when this happened and support them on that journey and it's a lot about storage from the top, right?

200
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:04,200
So the way you as a leader react to bad news, determine for instance, how the Company is coming to consider emotional safety and build trust.

201
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,200
We talk a lot about assuming best intent.

202
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:14,500
You have to have the default mode as you are in a remote work environment to assume that the other person has with the good intention.

203
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Whatever these thoughts that you have in your brain, you have let them go and focus on best intention.

204
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
That's number one is building.

205
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:30,600
Trust number two, is you need to be very specific in how you measure and Define results.

206
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,600
Because you're not anymore.

207
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:47,000
Assessing people on their presence in the office when we moved from the Industrial Revolution, from the factory to the office, we kept some of these managerial techniques of measuring people on how many widgets they produce or how much time they spend in the office.

208
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,200
And then so, so that ship in how we measure performance has to change.

209
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,700
And, and it has to be a more intentional process to set goals, from the company, level to the individual level.

210
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:08,000
And thirdly is to be clear of how you work together, what are the tools and the rules about collaboration of the company.

211
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,700
You need to put train people on it.

212
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,800
You need to model the way you as a leader, and you need to evolve it over time.

213
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:23,600
So three things, building trust having result driven culture and, and be clear about the tools and the rules.

214
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:30,100
And, and by the way, like even if you're in office company and you do these three things, you get better.

215
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:44,100
Moving to the note, exposes your weaknesses as an organization and become a forcing function to address some of these high performance Behavior, building trust, having clear results, having clear way of collaboration.

216
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:55,300
That's why I believe that the distributed company on through tomorrow are going to be the best companies now da, da Tony thanks for breaking it, breaking it down that way.

217
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:00,600
You know I think the one thing that stands out from that is going remote exposes.

218
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,600
All the gaps because you have nothing else to stand on.

219
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,700
But good process, good tools, good ways of working without that, everything just falls apart.

220
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:18,300
You know, let us shift gears into the impact that remote is having in the market.

221
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:19,900
You know?

222
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:27,800
Like we were part of these conversations all the time, you know, 24/7, Chris Tony myself.

223
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:40,900
We're involved in these conversations because we're Using for this future, where I not only for ourselves individual, he's for our families, but also for our teammates, and the technology, we're building.

224
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,400
The services were building is powering that shift as well.

225
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:56,400
But when you look at the reports that are coming up, you know, every week, there's another report about the benefits of remote what employees want.

226
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,400
There's, the war of the office and not office City, Teas or empty Office business.

227
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,700
Buildings are empty.

228
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:12,800
Even after companies are trying to perk, put all the perks, put the Rhode show on and get people with come back to the office.

229
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:28,200
It's pretty clear that employees want flexibility, they want freedom if we bring up this Forbes overlay there was this report recently cited around just the simple fact that remote is here to stay and it will continue to increase.

230
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:37,700
But what I found interesting about the They was that ninety percent of people surveyed found, it promises more productive remote.

231
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,600
The impact on their mental health was better and even post pandemic.

232
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,300
They're saying, this is what I want.

233
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,900
I want remote to be a permanent fixture in how I work.

234
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And, and the way that I work, the voice, the voices of the employees.

235
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,500
Come back really drastically on that.

236
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:05,700
However, there's been resistance As well from leaders and companies on this argument as well.

237
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:23,800
You know, I don't know which one of you may be that said, this, but it was something around the fact that this is the biggest shift that we're seeing in Tony, you touched on this recently, as well, kind of taking this back to the Industrial Age, this is the biggest shift we're seeing in 100 years in how we work.

238
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:41,300
Being able to hire people from around the world, being able to go to schedule, run your life versus around work, being able to get two hours back a day and commute being able to, for me, make pancakes for my little girl, every morning and to tuck her in every night.

239
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:49,000
That's, that's all that I know, I don't know, no other type of fatherhood, but that's my normal today and that's changing is going to have an impact on her life.

240
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,100
Is going to have an impact on my life and on our family's life.

241
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,200
How would you both?

242
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:55,400
With.

243
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,700
Summarize or articulate the actual shift that we're in because I every conversation I am in.

244
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,600
I have to bring people back to.

245
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:17,200
We're just in the beginning of the shift that when we look back 10 years from now, we're going to see, you know what, that to three year spans that five-year span that was the biggest shift, but we're just in the middle of it.

246
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,200
And sometimes we don't realize how big of a shift it is.

247
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,500
How would you articulate the shift that were undergoing right now?

248
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,700
You know, take off first or nay So far, it's Chris Cole.

249
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,100
Yeah this is a conversation.

250
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:42,700
I have with a lot of particularly investors, journalists friends family and I think there is a lot of Doubt, right?

251
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:49,600
There's a lot of media articles that are written by Rich real estate owners that will tell you the office is coming back.

252
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,600
And if you look at the date that they are doesn't really support that.

253
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,800
And when you dig in with people who the least offices, they don't support that either.

254
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,500
The more people I talk to Single day.

255
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:09,100
The more they tell me that they haven't the least new space in the last three years, and they won't the least new species space in the next 2.

256
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:17,000
So the belief that people can even go back to the office, even if they want to, is totally false companies.

257
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,200
Don't have enough space.

258
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:25,900
And I think, like, the second component is the best companies of today are leaning heavily into remote work.

259
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:36,100
You look at Airbnb doordash twilio You Yelp all of them have announced in the last couple of months that they're fully remote and that's a forcing function, right?

260
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:46,000
If the most desirable jobs are remote, the most talented people will go and work for those businesses, and they will Force the other companies to become more remote.

261
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,200
I spoke to Cal Newport about this as like a darwinian moment.

262
00:31:50,200 --> 00:32:10,300
For remote work Evolution, eventually the most remote companies were in, and they kill companies aren't removed and people don't believe that and My approach to that has been well, what metaphor can we used to help them understand that and the one that I have kind of settled on is the rise of e-commerce on the internet, right?

263
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,400
Go back to the early, 2000's.

264
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,000
How much stuff did you buy on the internet then?

265
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,700
Like, even when eBay was first around, I am Amazon with burst around hardly anyone.

266
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,500
But hardly anything online by 2010, that changed the law, right?

267
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:33,400
I am as in matured ebayid, matured more people, some people bought some things online fast-forward too today.

268
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:40,600
Almost everyone buys, almost everything online, cars houses you order your food and it turns up at your door.

269
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,500
And I think like taking that piece where we started, which is like, this is the most important shift in 100 years.

270
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Well, let us recognize how big a platform shift is.

271
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,600
It's the end of probably 30 years of innovation, right?

272
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,500
Mobile Computing, the internet communication software.

273
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,500
R like this, we have needed all this.

274
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:10,000
And I think the inevitable conclusion of that is you can work with anyone anywhere in the world irrespective of their geographic location.

275
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:25,200
And yeah, I think the consequence of that is that it's the biggest shift in 100 years It is pretty clear and pretty, pretty clear, Chris that you have been talking about this and thinking about this, for some time I get it.

276
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,400
That's, that's good stuff.

277
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,500
I will come on Tony.

278
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:36,800
Yeah, yeah, I mean it is a massive shift, and I am going to tell you what is driving that shift.

279
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,400
I mean, like, what is like, even this is a macro micro world we live in today.

280
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,000
Me give you some data point.

281
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:56,300
According to BCG even pre-pandemic, there were 90 million job remote knowledge, work job going unfulfilled in the west that's eight point.

282
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,500
Five trillion dollar of economic loss.

283
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,300
At the same time.

284
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:14,800
In the next 10 years were going to have 1.5 billion knowledge workers coming into the workforce, mostly in emerging economies.

285
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:22,300
That's the biggest demographic shift in workers demographic since the Industrial Revolution.

286
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:33,100
Combined, with what Chris said, at the maturity of Internet platform, collaboration software and the infrastructure that Chris is building for remote work.

287
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:44,699
It's going to enable these millions of people to participate in the global economy, Bryan Caplan Economist from George Mason University.

288
00:34:44,699 --> 00:35:00,000
Argues in his book, open borders that if you remove the concept of borders from Talent Mobility we can triple the world GDP 3x and knowing how much growth this capitalistic system needed to sustain itself?

289
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:10,300
I don't see any scenario in the future That doesn't enable these companies in the west to tap into this massive talent pool that is coming online in the next 10 years.

290
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,700
No doubt, no doubt.

291
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:26,900
I have you know, you have been talking about the impact to the economy, not just a shift in like, how we work, but the shift and unlocking opportunity, I am not going economic power.

292
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:36,700
I think about even the work that you're doing right now Tony with making it easier to hire people from around the world.

293
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:46,100
The impact that has on that person on R household, their family on their generation without them having to leave their family in the first place.

294
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:55,600
You know, a lot of people leave from they leave their family behind to go earn some income and better enrich their families back home.

295
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,300
Now, with this shift, what we're saying is, you don't have to leave, you can stay where you are.

296
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:08,900
We're going to enrich that unit and change that life, and that, that household as well, which is even the undercurrent of all of this.

297
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:18,400
There's this other shift, that's On a global scale, not just on the headlines of what we see, not just what he line puts out on Twitter and not just what, you know.

298
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,900
Somebody else who says in office is the only way.

299
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:40,600
It's the global scale to the impact that this has on the economy, which is really, really great to see, you know, one thing I have this overlay, I am going to bring this up, you know, Tony your team has put out an employee expectations report recently, and it's pretty clear in the fine.

300
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,100
Things that parties just have changed, right?

301
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:49,900
44 percent of remote work says, it's the top three factors in their ideal companies.

302
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,400
They're looking for remote work as a thing there.

303
00:36:52,400 --> 00:37:06,700
Expect 60% of them are expected to be able to work from anywhere, from their employers, and eighty, eighty percent of folks are saying that it's become so much, much more important since a pandemic for them to work remotely.

304
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,600
And, you know, numbers don't lie like when you have these conversations.

305
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,100
The folks us as Leaders, we're always hiring, folks.

306
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:24,500
I can't imagine saying I am not going to hire the best person best qualified person for the job regardless of where they're located because they're not willing to step foot into the office.

307
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:36,000
This is part of that big shift, the big shift I feel is like not just We have the technology to enable us to connect and work remotely.

308
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,500
Not just that there's been two years of us being forced to work remotely and productivity has gone up and the world continues to go around.

309
00:37:43,900 --> 00:38:02,300
But also I think the sentiment for us as people to say, you know what, like work is always been super important to me, but in recent years, what I have realized is that my life is more important to me and giving all these hardships that we're going through in the world.

310
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:10,000
This reprioritization at the it was really pushing the investment of remote because of employees that want to show up at the office.

311
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,600
Then what, what options do employers have?

312
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,300
I posted an article recently?

313
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:29,000
I think was yesterday that showed from a survey, a poll server that you're giving out in the market employers, want these many days, these many days of work from home, only employees when these many days.

314
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And what's happening is the chart is showing that companies are Moving towards what employees want?

315
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:48,800
Because employees control that story, which is, which is great to see, you know, Chris I when I see your pink background, show up in my Twitter or my LinkedIn and I typically just stop scrolling to see what's up.

316
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You have clearly had taken a strong stance on remote and you get into these back-and-forth with folks that have these opposing views and it's a great to see.

317
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,500
And it's Great content.

318
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:11,100
What, what, what have been, some of your, you know, your learnings from that because you're in it every single day, you're having these conversations, it threads?

319
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,200
What has been your learnings from being vocal and taken the stance on both sides of the party?

320
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:22,000
Because I am sure you're getting opposing views that try to shoot down a post that you put up?

321
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:29,800
Yes, I think some people have extremely strong reactions to some of the things I say, and I think that's good, right?

322
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:40,600
Like this is a grand experiment at the end of two years of incredibly difficult times in people's lives and I think it's important to shine a light on that.

323
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,900
Not everybody doesn't want the same thing, right?

324
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,000
Like you look at the day to Leo's day, I was maybe the most interesting what they released.

325
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,800
99% of people never want to go back to an office again, full-time.

326
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:59,800
That's a fact, for a, 50% of people never want to go back to an office at all.

327
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,600
That's a fact, two or three percent of people do want to go back to the office.

328
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:10,200
And I think there's a real danger that 23 percent are Extremely Loud.

329
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:17,000
They're disproportionately and management position, so they're going to determine what other people do and that's a problem.

330
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,500
I think your point on The, the amount of work that people want is super interesting, right?

331
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,900
I think those numbers come out with something like two point.

332
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,100
Eight days a week is what?

333
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,600
Workers want, employees want to give them 1.2.

334
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:44,700
And I think that is very interesting and it's very interesting because I think we need to name the white elephant in the room, which is everyone for the most part, there were only three million remote workers in the u.s.

335
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,500
Prior covid.

336
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:52,600
There's going to be 30 million plus immediately after there is going to be someone something like 80 million by 2030.

337
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,400
They want to point eight days.

338
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,700
At the end of a pandemic in the worst possible remote working conditions.

339
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,100
They couldn't travel, couldn't see their friends, they couldn't see their families, their homeschooling their kids.

340
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,000
So, they have had pandemic remote work, and they still want to point eight days at home.

341
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:20,200
Wait, until they got the intangible benefits that we have experienced right being able to live where you want being able to travel, more being able to Your kids.

342
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,500
And I think that's the most important part, right?

343
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:29,200
We me and Tony are companies build the Bullring Dusty unsexy part of remote work, right?

344
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,600
We build the infrastructure that enables teams to choose it really easily.

345
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:37,200
We can stay here all day and talk about the future work until we go blue in the face.

346
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:47,000
Why I really care about is the future a living and that's the real conversation I like to have with people, which is like, let us not just talk about work, but like what's the impact?

347
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,800
What's the outcome?

348
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,300
We told our own stories.

349
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,600
Right, Rob, you're in Pittsburgh, Tony is Miss. Tilly.

350
00:41:53,600 --> 00:42:03,300
Now I am going to lie down, we can't get in crisper, we can't get pissed, buried in Philly or be used as we got two NFL teams and then it's like, it gets messy, it gets messy.

351
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,300
But yeah, it like the real is everyone has a story and when you speak to someone you learn about them.

352
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,500
And yeah, that's what really matters here.

353
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,500
How can we enable that?

354
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,600
How can we build a bridge to a better future a living for billions of people globally?

355
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,800
Let us segue into that their topic here, because we're going to get into some audience Q&A.

356
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,100
And I want to make sure we respect for will be also times as well.

357
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,700
Just a reminder, if you have questions, I am sure you guys have a lot of questions.

358
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,600
Let us go ahead and drop those questions in the Q&A tab.

359
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,900
On the right-hand side of both the ones you want.

360
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,900
We will cover them here in a few minutes.

361
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:44,000
Let us segue into the third part of our conversation which is the impact in the future of work.

362
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,500
And I mean Chris you just said it you beat me to the punch here.

363
00:42:47,700 --> 00:43:01,800
But you said this countless times when I think it's really intriguing that it's not the future of work is the future of living and will love to unpack that a little bit more because, you know, yes, we have shared it us three.

364
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:18,400
Yes, we have it benefits us as well, but we're legit and living, we're living the story, we're living the, the benefit of remote and the impact that has on our living and what that means to us, Chris.

365
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,800
I mean what was in it.

366
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,500
I mean you're talking about this stuff all the time what was that shift in your mind?

367
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500
Because future workers been always a thing.

368
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:47,500
And I think organically, we have all just been having these conversations in our homes, with our partners, with our friends and say you know what like we have come to a Tipping Point that the last few years have been completely nuts on a Global Spectrum.

369
00:43:47,600 --> 00:44:19,200
Mm, and you start to prioritize things, you know, I don't know if I want to give up all these other things in my life, to show up at this job or to work at this place and parties, have shifted data is proving that Chris, what can you do in fact that just a little bit more the future within Crossing that office, saying let us change the mindset to just the future of living and starting from that place and then figuring out Work in that world.

370
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:32,500
For sure, I think that started with a conversation which begins with like four of the first principles of why like, why do people want remote work and where we got to with that?

371
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:41,200
And we're often begins is all this work led to Broken ways of living and you start to unpack that and you say, okay, what does that mean?

372
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:48,200
Well, if you go back 50 years, people spent more time in their local communities that were affiliated with churches.

373
00:44:48,200 --> 00:45:05,400
There was boot clubs, there was net in clubs and like whatever your feelings are about any of those things, like unquestionably people were more plugged into their Community, they were closer their friends, they were closer or their families and as the work they elongate people commute it for longer, they got less of those things.

374
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:18,700
And like the office today is this Adult kids club distraction Factory filled with ping pong tables and games consoles, where it's actually incredibly difficult to do your work.

375
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,500
And the reason for that is they want to keep you there for longer, right?

376
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,500
That's the way to maximize productivity.

377
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:32,200
Well, actually, like, perhaps there's a better way of working here, which is, if you start to trust people, you give them what they want.

378
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,300
The implication of that is they have a higher quality of life because they can travel more, and yeah, that lets not aim for a better future.

379
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:39,700
Work.

380
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,900
Who cares about that?

381
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,700
Let us aim for a better future a living.

382
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,700
So much easier and deeper way connect with people engaging with them on a real conversation.

383
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,400
No doubt, I love that.

384
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,000
I would love Crossing all the future work.

385
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:03,700
It just changes where you start from and you're starting from you first not the job, you're asking yourselves those deeper questions of why work?

386
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,100
What is the means to the end?

387
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:10,600
Is it, you know, it goes back to this one story or tail around.

388
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:19,400
Like, you know, like we have just been wired to work, work, work at all expenses and you're working, so that you can provide for your family.

389
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,700
So, You can spend time with your kids, so that you can do all these things.

390
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:39,800
And what I love about this shift is starting their first and asking how does work impact my life not the other way around, you know, Tony would love to get your thoughts on is segueing into the future a little bit broader than bike.

391
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,700
The now, let us go further out.

392
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:46,300
Let us go five years out and let us take, let us wrap up this conversation with.

393
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,600
Where are we going like Beyond?

394
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,000
And the impact on the shift that we're in right now.

395
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,500
How is this going to change cities?

396
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,300
How is it going to change real estate?

397
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,600
How is it going to change a ton of did?

398
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,000
I mean, there's a ton of things that would that's going to change over.

399
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
The next five years will love to Anchor.

400
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,500
Their what are some predictions?

401
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,300
What are some thoughts?

402
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:10,400
Some trends that you guys are seeing Tony would love to start with you.

403
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,400
And Chris, we can wrap up with you and we will go into Q&A here.

404
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:27,400
There are certain prediction that I would like to see happening in the next five to ten years and I will start with the more equal pay for equal work across the world.

405
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:36,800
It's a very charged topic, and we have seen some data that is encouraging a toaster because we employed people, we have all the employment data.

406
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:45,000
If your remote worker employed from an Emerging Market employed, for a company in the west, you at least can double your salary from local.

407
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:45,500
It's right.

408
00:47:45,500 --> 00:48:02,800
So that's a huge impact on many developing economies, especially as you shift, the direct investment from north to south and add more investment into these economies than just remittance which is today, most of what economists get.

409
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,800
So number one is really about moving into a world.

410
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:33,600
Transfer economy, the 1.5 billion I mentioned earlier, secondly, is a like to see this to create an opportunity for increasing diversity and Workforce, think about just think about gender diversity now.

411
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,500
Now, half of my team are women with Children, what?

412
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:42,900
Why it's possible for technology company we to have over 60 percent of their Workforce.

413
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:51,300
Women in 70 countries is because we were able to provide its Civil way of working that makes people successful and no matter how they want to work.

414
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,100
And, and so, so I would like to see a world where there's, there's more diversity.

415
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:08,700
Presented representation, thirdly, is, is really around the decline of urban areas and, and the so.

416
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:16,700
So we today, we pour the equivalent of four times, New York City in concrete to build urban areas in the world.

417
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:26,400
That is not sustainable and a big majority of people that lives in the city, don't want to leave the city, they are forced to be in that place.

418
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:36,400
Now some people might decide to want to be in cities and that's great, but many of the population in urban areas don't want to be in urban areas.

419
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:52,000
So, so I do expect that we're going to see the Revival of secondary cities countries by the living was going to become More than norm, and what's going to happen that means that people are more connected with their communities.

420
00:49:52,100 --> 00:50:00,300
People are more connected with nature and that has an impact on mental health and as well as the environment, right?

421
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:10,400
Because you if you're if you don't need to commute and if you're reducing your consumption footprint because you're not in a consumption world.

422
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,200
You know, I last time I was in New York like I was wondering what else?

423
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:25,500
But I am going to buy next like I had This feeling that suddenly that all these advertisement in my face, and all these shops, like, this didn't want to sell me stuff, but I don't want to buy.

424
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:36,700
And, and so, so it's really an opportunity to, to get out of this consumption trap that we have been fed by big Corporation.

425
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,800
And, so I do see that to be a very important move for Humanity.

426
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,300
No doubt, no doubt love it.

427
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,600
I mean, I think I The future, the future is bright.

428
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,400
According to those key things crisp top three on your side.

429
00:50:53,400 --> 00:51:00,200
I know you put a long list post recently about the this as well, and then we will get into open Q&A for the last 10 minutes here.

430
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:08,900
Yeah, I think for me the biggest one which seems most obvious to me that maybe is still most contrarian.

431
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:16,300
Is that a majority of the desk jobs globally will be done remotely and majority of the time by 2030?

432
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,800
Like to me that seems inevitable.

433
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,600
So inevitable.

434
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,700
It's barely worth speaking.

435
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,100
About lot of people disagree with that.

436
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:30,500
Number to the best companies will spend over 75 percent of their time, working asynchronously.

437
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,900
Again something I see growing incredibly quickly in the fastest growing tech companies.

438
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,800
Go boy, typically, that's a trend that's extrapolated elsewhere, right?

439
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:55,300
Wherever the tech companies do most people fall and then the final one, which relates to, the is a rise in the, the need for Quality writing, I think it's a skill that gets and has been lost in offices.

440
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:00,100
Where the loudest person in the room often wins, and that shouldn't be the case.

441
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:10,200
It's the people who have The best ideas who change the world and I think that piece is incredibly important which again, is something I see playing out in a lot of businesses.

442
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,100
No doubt, no doubt love it.

443
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:20,900
You know, part of me is like, this, everything you guys are saying I am like over here, snapping my fingers, and I am pretty sure a lot of folks that are watching are as well.

444
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,200
Let us get into Q&A.

445
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,100
I see a lot of things happening in chat.

446
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:37,200
If we get it to the top questions here for free guys, to upvote your most you most potent question here will get the top ones about it onto the stage so kicking off with Jen.

447
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,300
How do you help create a hybrid environment or remote opportunities?

448
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,900
For jobs that are Hands-On and can't be completely.

449
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:47,300
Remote example in person education.

450
00:52:50,500 --> 00:53:04,500
And if you guys want to take that one, I think the first I think we need to realize that there's a there's some on the quality in the world between the people that can remove the work and the people that cannot remote work, and we have to acknowledge that, right?

451
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:12,400
And I am hoping that the remote movement is going to create more human such an environment that everybody else in the work environment can benefit.

452
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:18,900
Now to answer this question directly is there?

453
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:25,100
There's Way to design your, your field work in a way that can be compatible with remote.

454
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:38,700
So anything that requires field presence, you are on the field, we're doing the work everything in, it does not require your field present can be done remotely, but again, this is cannot be your choice as an individual.

455
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:47,900
It has to be a choice of your team of your company to allow that to happen because you don't want to be in a case where you lose productivity or you lose opportunity to progress if you're not in the office.

456
00:53:48,500 --> 00:54:02,700
So anything that can be done without being in this place, in a specific place can be done remotely, but the own field activities has to happen in Jama and person.

457
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:18,400
Yeah, no doubt uses an interesting one because you know if you're building a car and you need it like to go and service this car, that's a Hands-On type of job and there's always going to be times that I think would get really interesting is the knowledge worker side of that.

458
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:29,400
And I think 20 years I mean is there're parts to the job that could be very well be done promote week and there're parts that maybe right now can't and I think it will be interesting ten years from now.

459
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:36,500
I think it's gonna be a lot of change to even how we think about things today because there's we're going to keep evolving and keep changing how we work.

460
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,700
As we move forward.

461
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,600
Let us take the next question from Rebecca.

462
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:49,600
Looks like also interested in culture and how we build culture remotely culture, seems Then Fall to trust and feel.

463
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,100
Feel much more like Consultants.

464
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,600
I think just kind of also Rebecca just to add to this.

465
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:04,100
I saw a lot of chatter and chat about trust and how do we and Chris you talked about we hire for this?

466
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,800
We're hiring somebody, we trust that they can get the job done.

467
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:13,000
How does this play a part in building a remote culture that's built on?

468
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,900
Trust Chris what are you seeing on your side?

469
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,000
As you're building up first base?

470
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:30,800
I don't Love Culture, I often hear like it's always companies, talking about culture, that shouldn't be trying to protect the culture they have.

471
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:48,400
So I think that's like where I would start for I prefer and why speak about is I much prefer to talk about community and how can we hire people that are community and I think the extension of that which Tony mention touched on earlier, is just because we're remote, first doesn't mean that we never spend time.

472
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,600
Together, physically.

473
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:55,700
Like, there're often times that you do want to come together and that does enable you to build those relationships.

474
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:06,000
And I think often actually it's worth acknowledging that in person is better for some things, but when you acknowledge that, you almost have to say, well, how much better?

475
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,100
And it's not 50% better, right?

476
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:15,000
Maybe it's like somewhere between zero and 20% better depending on how much time you spend with someone.

477
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:31,400
But the more time you spend with someone the closer is zero, it gets and you then have this, I guess, matrix by which you can make determinations on, when you should do certain things together to build the community, to build communication to build collaboration skills, No doubt.

478
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:39,300
You know, it's interesting because this coach or thing is it is a term that's thrown around a lot, quite a bit, you know.

479
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:54,200
I think also just if we build the rules on the tools effectively for us to engage in work together, a lot of these things take care of themselves but a lot of times we're been thrown into this world of figure out remote without having that in place.

480
00:56:54,200 --> 00:57:00,100
And we get into this like weird gray area of like, well, I don't see this person online.

481
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:00,500
What is that?

482
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:00,900
It.

483
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:12,800
Well our do you have the proper performance things in place and these are the conversations that lead to this tension oh Mark says I think is very similar to this.

484
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:23,600
How do you keep a remote only Workforce motivated and create trust and absence of physical team, building opportunities and I think?

485
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:30,500
So for us, we're remote team, and then we gather folks for a company on sites.

486
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,000
Periodically.

487
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,800
And that there is nothing.

488
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:45,100
You can replace us breaking bread and happen at meal or engaging in certain activities together that builds more connection.

489
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:59,800
And it's for us personally we are investing in remote first practices and tools and making time for us to connect face-to-face, periodically and the times, and we would connect face-to-face.

490
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:06,700
They're W, we're not talking about work, a lot of the times you were doing things that you don't typically can kick.

491
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:12,000
You can typically handle on video or a phone call, and we have done.

492
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:21,800
We have done that you know last year we do another one this year and that one day that we brought people together just injected this sense of community.

493
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:29,800
Chris back to your point is like the sense of belonging like these are my people and then I am going to climb back on my plane, and I am gonna go live where I live.

494
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,100
But now, I broke bread and strengthen that connection as well with my peers.

495
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,000
Chris Tony.

496
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:49,100
However, you guys looking at team building opportunities in this remote world, Yo, I will start, I think 1st grade question.

497
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:56,100
And you need to have a purpose in your business Beyond just printing money, right?

498
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:04,400
So that's going to create a lot of alignments and Clarity of purpose for the team.

499
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,200
So first is really you have to be clear about your mission and you have to live your mission.

500
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,700
Secondly is you have to listen too.

501
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:13,500
The employee.

502
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,300
So we do employment surveys to place a quarter.

503
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:22,800
The results are taken extremely seriously, they come to me as a CEO, and we talked about them and you should team meeting.

504
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:28,500
And then we plan ahead and communicate back what we're planning.

505
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:40,000
So that, and we have been having engagement in the company of top 2% of all these tobacco companies because you have implemented that constant feedback group of listening.

506
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:40,400
Yeah.

507
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:46,700
And I want to say, In-person meetings are important, but they're not important to get stuff done.

508
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,100
They're important to make you feel the trust.

509
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:55,800
And when we did our first executive in person, team meeting at oyster was November.

510
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:00,400
Last year, was 10 of my 10 people in my team.

511
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,100
One of them came to be, my VP product came to be saying before this meeting.

512
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,500
I knew, I could trust this team.

513
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:11,400
Now I can feel I can trust him to the difference between knowing and feeding.

514
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,700
They're both important.

515
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,900
But you don't need them necessary to.

516
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,100
You don't need to, to meet to get stuff done.

517
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:23,500
We need to meet to know certain things that you can build trust with other people.

518
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,400
It's good, it's good.

519
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Well, look, this brings us to the end of this conversation and now ended their I think it is a good place to end the difference between knowing and feeling around trust with your team, your remote team look at the end of the day, this is an amazing conversation.

520
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:47,100
We're talking about remote work, how is changing the way that we work.

521
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,000
Chris Tony, thank you for being here.

522
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:55,500

523
01:00:55,700 --> 01:01:01,500

524
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,300
Prioritize yourself for start from there.

525

Hello, welcome.

20
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,400
Welcome.

21
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,500
Well it's so excited to get this conversation going.

22
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:07,200
Before we do that instead of kind of the traditional bios, I am hoping each of you could share one of fun fact about you and let us begin with Justin.

23
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,400
Thank you for Marcus Lee thrilled to be talking to you all today and everyone online.

24
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:32,200
My fun fact is I grew up on University campuses Particularly from where I am from Australia, the University of Melbourne and so that really shaped who I am and my perspective and I guess it was no surprise that I ended up spending my career in education at McGraw-Hill.

25
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,700
I am Raphael and I grew up in the Champagne region in France, like very far away.

26
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,100
I think even philosophically and conceptually from where we are now.

27
00:07:48,100 --> 00:08:02,800
And in a way I got a chance to get into programming kind of early on someone by chance which gave me a window into a much bigger world and started developing programming as a freelancer growing up in realize that there wasn't much of an ecosystem around me.

28
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,600
So I had to Leave moved to Israel.

29
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Now the US and I realized that in a way, I have been waiting for the things that we're about to talk about my whole life, to be able to team up with amazing people to do, meaningful work, kind of wherever you are and collaborating to build great things.

30
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,200
Kim.

31
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,799
You might set up in your lighting setup.

32
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,500
You like, that's not my fun fact, but I just really am loving your setup here.

33
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,300
My fun fact is I have never had any formal HR training or education as a theater major.

34
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:54,300
So for any of you out there who are pursuing non-traditional career paths or your kind of wandering aimlessly around finding your way to people work, you are not alone out.

35
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,500
There are a lot of us out here who learn on the job.

36
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,400
Samara.

37
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,400
Yeah, over to me.

38
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,000
Let us see.

39
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:24,300
My son fact is that I may be not so surprising to those who know me but connecting a kind of I am a connector really like in My DNA and it was only during the pandemic that I had.

40
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:33,400
This kind of aha moment that really connected the thread throughout my life, which is I have always been a connector as early as I can remember.

41
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:44,300
I was bringing together individuals within different friend groups and of in high school and then it has been a thread that has really kind of driven me throughout.

42
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,900
And certainly.

43
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:54,700
Now, I have been in the business that I am at, which is building an ecosystem, it's all about bringing people together, bringing companies together Building Bridges.

44
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,600
So, connections, run, deep in my jeans.

45
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,900
So, thank you all for your amazing, fun facts.

46
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,800
Great to get to know you a little bit better.

47
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:18,300
Let us dive in today I am hoping that we can start by level setting on today's topic, and so I thought I would toss it over to Rafael if you wouldn't mind sharing?

48
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,900
What does it mean to be a cloud based company?

49
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,900
Yeah, you know, it's obvious in a secret that we have been through so much transformation of work over the past few years.

50
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:40,400
But if we try to Packet, even from starting from few decades back, we have seen more and more layers of the tools that we use, and the infrastructure were using to build companies.

51
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,500
Go to the cloud.

52
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:55,000
So much, so that I think is as Derek Thompson pointed out, you can be sitting in the same room with a colleague and yet, most of the time that you will be working, you will be working through tools in the cloud.

53
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:01,600
Even that you sit next to your colleague, and we have seen every piece of the stack Move online.

54
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,600
Obviously came with oyster is an example of that.

55
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,300
And there's many more we use slack with.

56
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,400
You seem we will all these things.

57
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:17,900
Now, it seems that, you know, the, the acceleration of the transformation of the past few years, is much bigger than just a question of remote and how many days in the office?

58
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:23,200
And I think we here today because we know that this is a bigger question than this.

59
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:38,800
And there is this transformation happening to the very models of how companies Being built the last leg sort of speak is actually the most important one and that's the people part moving.

60
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:45,700
Also, to the cloud kind of The Last Mile, that may change everything a good way to think about.

61
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,600
It would be to think about the focus point.

62
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,800
The focus point is no longer about geography, but it's about how to bring.

63
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:05,100
So you used to have hq's for example, where all the decisions are made a lot of companies are still working this way, and we find that to be less and less effective.

64
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:15,500
As we try to learn how to make decisions in a way that is much more distributed so that good people and Executives and leaders and teams all over the world, can collaborate an effective way.

65
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,200
And we have seen that there are new models emerging of teams that are forming essentially online.

66
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:33,800
We call this cloud-based teams that are enabling companies to form those hybrid Workforce going from full-time to Tourist people from different places that are assembling in a very Mission.

67
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Focus way and are acting as drivers into the company's so excited to explore those new models and how they are changing the game for companies of pretty much all size.

68
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,300
Thanks for off.

69
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,900
Why don't we dive into talking more about each of your respective companies and teams and the cloud?

70
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:04,000
Maybe you could each talk a little bit about the models that you're deploying within your team's, you know what challenges and opportunities have you seen result from that?

71
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,000
And maybe let us get started with Justin.

72
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:23,400
I am sorry here at McGraw-Hill, we have a bit different to the number of companies either 130 year old foundation in the education industry and where we are a highly distributed company.

73
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,700
So we have been working in for many of you would know us as from the print publishing days.

74
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:39,100
Now to a point where we continue to transform and involved with our fantastic content through our digital platforms, Just like Disney place.

75
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,400
So, just like HBO.

76
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:49,700
And so, when we think about cloud based teams and cloud based companies, it's really about how we interact with our customer.

77
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,600
How do we react with our people and our processes?

78
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,100
So over the last 2, through 20 or so years, we have seen a rapid acceleration here at McGraw-Hill, and for us.

79
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:10,400
It all starts with our customer, and we will talk a little bit about a bit more, but how we're able to listen to them very A lot in a different way and much faster way.

80
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:25,300
But also internally Now teams we're able to deploy teams a lot faster, a lot quicker, a lot more dispersed around the countries and then also the tools as well that we put in place to make sure that collaboration is happening.

81
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:37,800
So you know whether that in my area where that's transformation, corporate planning em a new product development, we are deploying very fundamental same.

82
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,000
The rules as we go in and accelerate, the work that goes on in the cloud.

83
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,600
So, I will jump.

84
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,100
Yeah, I will jump in because I think oyster is almost the opposite of McGraw-Hill here in that.

85
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:01,200
We are a two-year-old company, and we are now about 650 employees across 70 countries.

86
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:16,800
So we are extremely distributed, but we are a company that was founded during the pandemic, and so we never had to make a transition from in person to hybrid to remote the company was founded.

87
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,500
On the premise that it would be a fully distributed fully remote company from the start and forever.

88
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:32,200
And so, when we think about the type of company, we want to build it is by default cloud-based, but it's also intentionally cloud-based.

89
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:41,300
I think, even if we stir wasn't founded during the pandemic, it would have been fully cloud-based as we say.

90
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:51,900
Because our Founders really believe in that and believe in the future of Distributed work as an equalizer in terms of employment around the world.

91
00:15:52,600 --> 00:16:03,900
And so we built the company over the last two years, at lightning speed to, in service of this Mission and service of using cloud-based employment.

92
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:12,300
As a way to talk to open up opportunities for people, like Ralph, who had to leave home to find the right kinds of opportunities.

93
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,300
The hope is that we can make that change.

94
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:34,200
Very much relate to that as well because you know we ask ourselves the question at the beginning of a team of could we enable the most highly skilled Professionals in Tech to a to somewhat Escape rigid structures and team up with people?

95
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:41,000
They want to work with to solve problems, that matter, to them with full autonomy, and growing and learning while doing so.

96
00:16:41,800 --> 00:17:05,099
And that was kind of the question that triggered this development of Information platform that enables the formation rapidly of highly motivated, High performing teams, that companies of different stages can use to bring on in supercharger initiatives or, or create new ones very quickly.

97
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:16,000
Now, we got started very much in the wake of the pandemic, like, we build that before that, with our, my cloud-based teams, sounded like something, that would be somewhat far away even though someone invisible just happen, much faster.

98
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,400
So, we don't have much of a choice than to build Fully remote.

99
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:28,700
I mean, I think it took a year until we could meet until I could meet my team effectively, but we grew as well to over 20 countries.

100
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,300
And now, the, the Network that has been built behind it to power.

101
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,800
That information engine is now seven thousand people strong.

102
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,600
Even though it's kind of by definition, by Design, hard to get into.

103
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:55,100
You have, like, product managers designers Engineers, data centers that are leaving Tech Giants, and other companies that have been asking themselves the question of Hey I want to be working on things that truly matter to me with great people and that's how I see my growth.

104
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,200
Kim mentioned something interesting about democratizing opportunity and access we very much see that happen.

105
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:11,700
I think it's great to have this group here of widely different companies in a way because we see that some of the most interesting opportunities for transformation.

106
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,800
For building, the things that will change the day-to-day and provide incredible drivers for growth.

107
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:25,700
Actually incredibly compelling for some of the best Minds on the planet and that's what we're seeing essentially every day.

108
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:39,600
And as companies basically rethink the models for company buildings for company building, they can tap into this opportunity to assemble phenomenal teams with it full-time, employees, part-time employees, whatever.

109
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:48,100
As long as they are formed around a mission and shared purpose, actually attracting people to solve a problem that they deeply care about.

110
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,500
Out.

111
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,500
Let us jump.

112
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,000
I guess, from higher level down to some more tactics.

113
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,900
So, I am interested to hear from each of you.

114
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,100
You know, what are you doing to Foster effective collaboration?

115
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
Within your team?

116
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,200
So how are you structuring those teams?

117
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,300
What processes are you putting in place to really help create that collaborative environment?

118
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,000
Just, and I know you have some good story.

119
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,800
To tell here.

120
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,000
So I don't over to you.

121
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:34,400
Of course, I think for us at McGraw-Hill, we a ticking, the team that I work with a very distinctly different whether it's a new product development, MMA, corporate strategy.

122
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:46,700
And what's important is the difference between what we found is the difference between the day-to-day work and the week two, I would say the week-to-week first worse, the goal setting.

123
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,600
And so for us, We found it, very important.

124
00:19:49,600 --> 00:20:00,000
There is always there's a need for us to come together, and we typically do that every quarter, and we set our vision like the why, why are we working on whatever we're working on?

125
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,900
Why is it worth as Ralph said, why is this a problem worth solving?

126
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,800
I think we all go to work for a different reason other than just getting financials up.

127
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:17,900
And so when we meet it's almost entirely on the Y, and then we move into execution mode we have all agreed on the way, we all understand.

128
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,700
And we all bought in on the why.

129
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,900
It doesn't matter where the people are from.

130
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:46,500
There could be people from you know that we work with our partners and as long as we're sharing the exact same vision, we then move into a weekly cycle and what we found works really well is using tools to sit down every Monday over a zoom call or a Google call going through what are our goals of the week and then being very deliberate around deciding.

131
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:58,200
Well when do we need actually Foster Collaboration during that week and saying, okay, if we're going to hit this goal X or Y person, need to talk to each other, it would be good to have that kind of conversation with each other.

132
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,100
I think, what's also important as well, and what we do, which has been working its at the end of the week.

133
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,800
Coming together again, going through everything, we have achieved and celebrating it.

134
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:17,900
And so we have a nice clean end of the week, but there's a celebration of moving towards that Vision that the collective team has been working.

135
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,400
Words.

136
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,200
And so, of course, my will keep iterating.

137
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:29,100
I am sure like we're everyone on the call will be, but it's certainly been a learning journey, and we keep getting better and better, and keeps working better.

138
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:46,300
Government relate to this as well because I find that, you know, there's some fundamental shift that's happening with the way particularly highly skilled, but I think workers in general was I thinking as shown by the great resignation.

139
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,600
Now the latest version of it which is more quiet.

140
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Apparently is said, look, ultimately, this is something that was bound to happen for.

141
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:07,300
For while we're, you know, in, in the days of the past, you would say to a company Okay, I will join you for and I will give you the right to tell me where to be what to do, who to work with.

142
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,800
And you will give me stability and early into the pandemic.

143
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:21,000
We saw that the stability could expire very quickly, but to go at the time, where a company's thought that the world was ending, and they were like, okay, you, you're laid off right overload.

144
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,800
And then a month later it was like, oh, actually the world is not ending.

145
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,500
If you could, please come back to be great.

146
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,700
Now, there's a, there's a market checkup.

147
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,700
And in some potential bad news coming up.

148
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,500
And again, you know, second time in two years people are getting laid off again, including from profitable companies that have to increase margin.

149
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,100
And you also find alongside that companies are getting bigger and bigger faster than ever.

150
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,800
So that the overall appeal of the mission of a company becomes diluted, the bigger it gets.

151
00:22:52,400 --> 00:23:04,800
So people saw that plus at a time when there was a remember that life can be short like you know during the pandemic I think that's the realization does a big religion of people have, they really care about working on things that matter to them.

152
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:11,900
And so the core thing to bring a team together is to is and of course shift.

153
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:27,200
I think that's happening with companies is they're starting to forward-thinking leaders, a rethinking, how the think of the workforce from the old ways of thinking and headcount and departments basically trying to fill up you know spreadsheets that you do at the beginning of the year.

154
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:35,100
And you basically say okay I need that many Engineers have any product people Market ourselves people to think in terms of what are the initiatives?

155
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,400
What are the Real problems?

156
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:43,800
I am trying to solve what are the real solution that I want to put forward and what are the teams that I need to drive those outcomes?

157
00:23:45,000 --> 00:24:02,700
And when you start thinking that way you basically start, not just having the overall company Mission but you have the missions within the mission and those missions enable them to think in terms of teams and for those mission-driven team's Mission based work teams, essentially you can attract and retain.

158
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,900
Really good people that are motivated to share common adversity and common experience.

159
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,400
And that's where all of our human elements kind of kick in of, you know, teaming up with people.

160
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:28,900
Really driving to an outcome and that requires for the teams to be more, autonomous to be cross-functional right to have essentially as much of the skills of the diverse skills needed perspectives and backgrounds in order to accomplish that goal.

161
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,600
And that empowerment of teams toward mission is enabling companies to move.

162
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:42,700
Much faster to tackle a much wider surface area and to enable company that hasn't haven't been able to transform for a while.

163
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,500
To certainly be able to do that and people are happy through that because they get to choose.

164
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:56,500
I think what rastetter that cross-functional teams was spot on the challenge with tech and cloud.

165
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:09,300
Based, organizations is Convergence and when anything in ref, we talk about it when everything converges and it converges a lot faster and more frequently with tech whether its product.

166
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:19,100
You know, back in the day used to be about the supply chain, you have different teams doing very Rolls and then there was Pastor down the supply chain.

167
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:36,200
These days, the hardest part is managing convergence and being proactive, around convergence, and you need a cross-functional team even if you're doing HR transformation and HR initiative to a product initiative, the need for a cross-functional team that's focused on one.

168
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:44,600
Common goal has never been more Paramount to be successful if I could jump in and get attacked.

169
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,800
Uncle for a second here.

170
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:55,400
I am not sure what the breakdown is of our audience in terms of Founders and leaders versus operators, but I will speak to the operator perspective for a second.

171
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:10,000
When you're bringing people together, I noticed in our poll that 75% of our audience here or respondents are in a hybrid environment and eighty percent of our respondents here are a mix of full-time and Freelancers.

172
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:29,300
So in either of those cases, you have a serious risk of Creating an equity in your organization, whether you're treating full-time employees and Freelancers in a different way, in terms of inclusion, in terms of perspective, sharing or your hybrid and, and or your rest are your remote.

173
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:57,800
And in office, employees are having different experiences to think, really tactically about what you're trying to achieve as an organization and what you're trying to achieve in terms of input, in terms of involvement from People around the organization being hyper aware that when you have people who have different types of employment, or different locations of employment, you have to be all that more intentional about how you include their perspectives in the conversation.

174
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:23,700
So, whether that's something you see, a lot is in meetings, where you have some folks in the office and some folks dialing in, it can be really common for the people who are sitting around the table to be talking to each other around the table and ignoring the folks, who are on the call to the extent that someone mentioned On a panel, I was on recently that they were watching they feel like they were watching a meeting happen, and they were kind of off to the side and the meeting ended.

175
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,900
And before the zoom ended they saw.

176
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,000
People going off to have side conversations.

177
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:38,600
They're like wait, I am over here on the screen and now they have missed out on that potential to collaborate and there's all this research about how this type of environment, more directly benefits.

178
00:27:38,600 --> 00:28:10,100
Men, specifically benefits, white middle-aged men but to really be more inclusive in how You're thinking about who makes decisions, who's, in the room when those conversations happen, who has access to the people of influence, within the company and your role, as an HR practitioner, and an employee experienced practitioner, as any sort of operator who touches this field is to be looking for those unheard voices and to be looking for, not just who makes the decisions, but who's a stakeholder who needs to be involved, whose voices, haven't we heard?

179
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,900
Is everyone on the decision-making?

180
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,200
Team kind of homogeneously.

181
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:36,700
Acted or do we have a real diversity and thinking about, thinking about things, like, how you include folks, who aren't in the, in the physical space with you, you have to, you don't have to do that as much when you're fully remote because it's more about whose invited to the column, who's who can make it to the call.

182
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,800
And the only thing I will add there before I shut up about this is when you are really distributed.

183
00:28:44,700 --> 00:29:02,200
Everywhere in the world, you have to think about times and inclusivity in a way that you don't, when you're all physically in one space, I spent most of my career with companies who were primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area occasionally with one or two folks around the world occasionally with like a New York office and San Francisco office.

184
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:14,500
But when you're operating in time zones, all over the place, coordinating offices, hubs people working from home, you have to really think about what does it mean to have a standard operating schedule?

185
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,400
Is it mean to have core working hours?

186
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,400
What needs to happen, synchronously versus what can we change to happen, asynchronously?

187
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:36,500
And it really takes a nun learning of how you work together and what you need to be successful at work to make sure that you're being inclusive of all of the people who, you know, are in your same physical location, okay?

188
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,300
Cam before we move off of that, I know.

189
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:46,500
Sure and always stir, I think have a philosophy around You know, creating some of that inclusivity.

190
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,200
I believe you call it like follow the sun.

191
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,800
Maybe I believe we do.

192
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,300
Yes.

193
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,000
Can you explain?

194
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,900
Yes.

195
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,400
Absolutely.

196
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,100
I will.

197
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:02,800
I can try to find or if someone from the Welcome admin, team wants to find him pop it into the chat.

198
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,300
We're open sourcing.

199
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:15,900
All of this, we have it all in public facing the ocean pages but our internal philosophy of following the sun is that the sun is always going to be rising on someone a toaster but that doesn't mean You work 24/7.

200
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:32,100
We are enabled to have our work happened in a good 24 hours anchors, you know, cycle around the world but you have to get really good at knowing when to shut off and knowing how to hand your work over to someone else so that you can shove off.

201
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,300
And also that means sometimes taking advantage of really weird nonlinear work schedules.

202
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,500
I was working late last night because my colleague in Australia and I really Just like needed to unblock something with each other.

203
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,600
And it was his morning.

204
00:30:49,600 --> 00:31:02,800
It was his Monday morning and it was my Sunday evening, and we just kind of jammed on it for a little bit and knowing that like that sometimes is necessary to get what you need out of work.

205
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:14,500
That's traveling all around the world but I also knew that I needed to get things in a good enough place before I went to bed that my colleagues waking up on Monday morning who needed to take the Baton and carry that work forward, would have everything they needed to be successful.

206
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,600
And I knew that, like, Do you have being very candid Friday?

207
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,900
Was a little bit wacky for me and this weekend.

208
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:32,100
It was wacky with the kids and I didn't have any time to catch up so it was Sunday night Sunday, night, prep work that I had intended to do in more reasonable working hours.

209
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:44,000
But having that idea, that I am going to do my work during the day and do a handoff either to My Future Self or to my co-worker, who's going to wake up 812 hours from now, I need to pick this back up.

210
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,700
It allows the work to continue and allows it to keep moving forward.

211
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,400
In a really kind of respectful and responsible way.

212
00:31:52,500 --> 00:32:13,100
And we have hilarious videos on our website about this, but also tons of great content and templates that we can find in share with attendees, because we really believe that if you're going to build companies that are in the cloud, you have to allow your work to be in the cloud and you have to allow your connections.

213
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:18,000
You can't just try to replicate that experience that we talked about in the beginning.

214
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,600
It was like we're working in the cloud, but we're sitting next to each other slacking and Google docking next to each other.

215
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,700
So we can just turn to the person next to us and like, talk live and then get back into our Google Docs.

216
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,300
I don't know if that's the healthiest way to work anyway.

217
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:36,900
So this is okay for work, is truly going to be distributed in the cloud, we are going to also be distributed in the cloud.

218
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:46,300
How do we still connect the dots so that we can still collaborate together and that's thank you, Katie for sharing that this is That we're at we worked on?

219
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,800
And I will say, very candidly that we released this.

220
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,600
About a year ago, we were about 300, 250, 300 employees.

221
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:00,000
When we released it, we are now a year later thinking about how does that scale for 650 people?

222
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,400
How does it feel to 800 people?

223
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,200
How it will this continue to scale with us over the years?

224
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,200
I am not much is changing about the structure of how we work.

225
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,500
It's more about how we bring people on board and how we, how we get adopted.

226
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:23,200
Option, that's that to me is the piece that we don't talk about a lot with this, as you can have, all the great room at work philosophies that you want.

227
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:29,900
But if people are still stuck in their old ways of working, then it's going to, it's not going to work.

228
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,300
It's so interesting.

229
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,600
I think hybrid is its red.

230
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:43,600
The hybrid is, in a way like particularly challenging but, you know, I am interested to see like we have in the polls as I see 60% of people of mix of ft and Freelancers.

231
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:51,400
We just run a just ask like 600 founders of companies, but of question to understand the transformation happening.

232
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:57,400
And I think it was around that as well as, but 70% that used kind of Highly skilled contractors as part of their teams.

233
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,700
And, you know, something happened to me early this year That was a big surprise.

234
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:12,500
I so, as I mentioned before, it took over a year to even just meet the team that we have assembled in person because we were deep in the pandemic when we got started.

235
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,900
But at some point we're about 60 people back.

236
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:20,699
Then we were like, okay, let us gather everybody full week in Portugal, and we did.

237
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,800
And when we got together there and look around, like, wow, that's crazy.

238
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,600
I have had a chance to start a few companies before and be involved in a bunch of companies.

239
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,100
I have actually never seen in that level of diversity.

240
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,000
And I mean diversity from the sense of people coming from all kinds of countries.

241
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,800
Speaking with all kinds of different English accent and coming from a very different background.

242
00:34:43,699 --> 00:35:03,500
And the really amazing thing about it is that it was obvious, that they share the same values, despite their vastly different backgrounds, and the, and the came to this, to the respective mission-based teams, because they care about the On the care about the mission, the value, we're trying to accomplish.

243
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:14,900
That was a big surprise for me because early stage, typically, as you mentioned Kim, like, if you build team in San Francisco, you can try to push for diversity, but at the end that you have people in San Francisco versus in a bunch of countries.

244
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,400
And I see that also, with the type of teams that Justin is building.

245
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:32,200
I think there's diversity in all kind of dimensions of his fascinating when you see people from not just on different locations but also that come from small company, background startups, large companies, Etc, and seeing those people come together, Heather learn from each other share.

246
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:45,800
Different perspective is really powerful, so yes, it's brings a ton of challenges rethinking and of that get that new muscle memory as someone mentioned in the chat, but it has the advantage of actually finding the world.

247
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:51,700
Bring the best of the best from a much wider aperture in perspective.

248
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,300
It's exciting to see how that makeup is maybe a way to deliver on the diversity.

249
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,200
That is needed to solve.

250
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,100
Complex problems came.

251
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:26,100
I could not, I could not be loved your intentionality around equity in the workplace and it's certainly something that, you know, leaders need to be proactive on fostering in the workplace, it doesn't just happen if you don't proactively think about it, you know, I just maybe add to two different two separate rules.

252
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,200
We have put in place for that in that, in light of that, Kim as well.

253
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:37,000
Well one, we have a rule that if everyone you know this equality server, all hot online, we're all going to be online.

254
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,500
No one's going to be in the office.

255
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,700
Happy barking, me office.

256
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,300
People are going to be on Zoom.

257
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,900
We felt when we work with contractors and Freelancers is really talented people.

258
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Everyone's the same.

259
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,500
Everyone's equal when they're on, we're on a call like this.

260
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,200
And so, that's been really important to bring people together and have a voice.

261
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,100
Secondly, one thing.

262
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,900
We observed as well, was particularly at the executive level we weren't.

263
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:17,400
It's hard to see the people that are moving up the organization and then a shining in the doing the work every day and when we come together and do steering committees, right?

264
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,000
Very formal steering committees.

265
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,400
We realized that this was a great opportunity to ask people.

266
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,100
Ask is we are getting the same Business Leaders every week presenting.

267
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,200
And we said well, how do we bring different?

268
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,700
Different people to life.

269
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:43,300
And so we now make it a rule that someone in the actual working team needs to present a known the work, and that has really changed that the culture, and we can see it going.

270
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,100
Instead of just hitting the top, it goes up and down a lot faster now and that's made a big change for us.

271
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,400
I really like that Justin.

272
00:37:51,400 --> 00:38:07,700
I think something that we when you look at leadership teams, and we look at communication, a lot of times I think leadership teams feel like they have to represent the work that their team has done because that shows connection and that should just buy in.

273
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:15,300
And yeah, even if they're even if you're a movie, go from the equation which is not always easy to do there.

274
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:35,200
Is Often this element of like I have to show that I believe in this work by Speaking on behalf of the people who did it and sometimes you do need that, sometimes you do need that executive level or leadership level by and especially when you're delivering a message, across a wide range of people and locations and you're doing it on virtually.

275
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,500
It's nice to have that kind of executive presence.

276
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:47,100
However, I think you can accomplish that by having the executive presence as the like introduction or a be like this is something that's super important.

277
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,600
And now I am going to shine a spotlight on the people who actually did the work.

278
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,000
Work.

279
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,600
And then that provides really nice growth opportunities for those people who might not get that exposure.

280
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:16,100
Otherwise, and especially, I mean, we talked about as a hybrid work environment and folks who having access or not and who's in the office, and who's not in the office, who does that disproportionately benefit Giving the people who do the work, the opportunity to speak up, whether they are in an office or dialing in provides that platform.

281
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,800
And that access, I think anyone out here, who is a manager.

282
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,200
Like, like, I encourage you to take really take that to heart.

283
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,800
And think about, why do I feel like I need to be the one presenting this?

284
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,300
Why does, what does it say about my ego?

285
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,800
What does that say about my insecurities?

286
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:42,500
That I feel like I need to present on behalf of the work that my team has done and instead using it off And opportunity to elevate your team and Elevate the talent that you have.

287
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,500
Well, so sure I am strong Martinez.

288
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:52,700
Also, showed a strong and cohesive your team is, that's comes across really strongly for the great teams.

289
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,700
Great pie routines that were together.

290
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:07,500
So, let us actually take an audience question that was submitted during registration, which was beyond the it organization, what culture shifts are needed.

291
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,400
Within the rest of the organization to maximize the benefits of a cloud-based company.

292
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
Oh my heart.

293
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,800
There's it might I say my heart because it's something the whole we're always, were always wrestling with it.

294
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:30,500
We stir with in terms of like hiring and onboarding and education.

295
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:39,400
And so, when you think about the culture shift, you need the culture ships, you need, are you need everyone to be bought into the way you're working first and foremost.

296
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:46,600
And it sounds really simple but it's actually Quite interesting, the more you hire.

297
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:59,100
The more people you have to bring on board with the way that you're working, and I like it to like when event if we could all walk back in time to our in office days and remembering how like no one ever does our dishes in the kitchen, right?

298
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:12,800
And everyone's feeling the sink with their dishes and your poor office manager is like watching everyone's discussing dishes, but if you start teaching people, that part of your company culture is to do the dishes and it's part of your ritual as part of individual.

299
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,900
Ship and accountability.

300
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,200
And you start teaching people that when they come onto the team as new hires during onboarding.

301
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:42,500
I promise I am going somewhere with this as the, as your ratio changes and the more people you have, who have learned that as part of their new hire experienced, the that drives the culture shift because you suddenly, you have more people who know that it's their own personal responsibility to do their own dishes, then you do people who are used to somebody coming in and doing it for them and it's the same with any culture.

302
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,400
That you need to be a successful cloud based company.

303
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:58,200
The more people you have who are bought in to the idea of the ritual, the Norms that are part of your culture, the less work you individually, have to do.

304
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:15,300
And there's a lot of work that ours like dish doing work, the like the documentation the handoffs, the pre reads before the meetings the remembering to make At the meeting is happening at a rotating inclusive.

305
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:31,000
Time the taking note of whose in the room and who's not in the room, the virtual room, all of those things are things that it's really, really easy to get lazy about and it's really, really easy to revert back to the way you have been working for 10 years, 15 years.

306
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:44,600
However, many years before you transition into working hybrid or working fully remote, and the truth is that the in-office behaviors and Norms are not directly preferable one-to-one with working.

307
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:54,500
That sort of individual administrative burden that you take on like needing to show up in a different.

308
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:14,700
Like that's very different from like the culture shift of like we all say hi at the beginning of the day like yes that's nice but that's not what makes up the experience of being a part of your team sculpture and all of that other stuff is about individual responsibility and buy in to the way of working that you're trying to work.

309
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,300
Boy stur, folks.

310
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,600
It's everyone's job.

311
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,400
I know my coworkers are listening.

312
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,700
Justin, do you want to add?

313
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:37,100
I am curious mean at an organization that has so much Legacy right in his has certainly been in office historically how I guess what advice do you have in terms of driving that culture shift?

314
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,500
So who questioned culture is so important?

315
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:54,000
I think one when you're a larger more established culture, there's a reason why you have been sohrab us for so long and it's taking the tenants.

316
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:02,700
You know, I think about when I am back in the day, when I used to play basketball, you know, you have your pivot fit, you got one pivot foot of what made you, what makes you so strong.

317
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,100
In our case, it's out, purpose around improving education.

318
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,500
It's our commitment to high quality.

319
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,700
Be content and Trust in the education industry.

320
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:20,400
But then pivoting accordingly and that pivoting requires that's the part that requires a culture shift at times.

321
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:38,300
And so for us, it's allowing our teams to experiment allowing and whether that is like different models, working with different types of vendors, different types of employment, type of ways, whether it's contractors Freelancers, which you hadn't traditionally done.

322
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:50,400
Whether that is different types of people with different types of background and allowing the team's only to work faster.

323
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:59,300
But also it's okay to fail as long as there's a reason and there's a vision of why we're trying to get to a certain location.

324
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:05,700
So that has been as we improve the culture just being okay with saying okay things aren't going to work.

325
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,200
Tools aren't going to work, but we're going to keep trying.

326
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,900
Going to get better and better whilst we keep our pivot foot.

327
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:16,000
I want, what makes us successful company over the last 130 years.

328
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:24,200
So let us take one more audience question and then I will get to some of our others that we had too many questions for the time allotted today.

329
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:33,800
But maybe from Joe what do L most often get wrong when it comes to managing remote teams, and we're off.

330
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,400
Do you want to take that one first?

331
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,800
Yeah absolutely.

332
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,000
I think you have also break down leaders.

333
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,300
I think this is of transformation just makes the people leaders.

334
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,200
The HR leaders such kind of the Agent of Change.

335
00:45:47,500 --> 00:46:03,200
Julie that have to get into the business if more than ever because those culture shift that we talk about and kind of moving away from the supply chain type of thinking, that, that Justin mentioned before is really important.

336
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:09,900
But when you think about it, it's been great in us forever like essentially, like ever since the factories, right?

337
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,900
We are used to, like, coming in the morning, doing work synchronously, living at night.

338
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,200
And that's, that's our starting point still today.

339
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,000
So what Leaders with leaders?

340
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:26,200
I think that the shift that's happening is power to the edges.

341
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:42,900
I can you truly Empower a team to drive results and to own that result And that is a significant change from the way decisions have been made and organization have been designed.

342
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:57,300
But it's also the way to be not as to be much less commoditizing as we used to write like people, leave commoditized position communities jobs leaders, that argument sizing them, effectively.

343
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,900
And want to join the places that give them the power of choosing.

344
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,800
The problems that they care about to actually driving the an actual impact that matters to them.

345
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:17,100
So being able in the hard part about this with leaders that it's actually hard to remember, what are the outcomes that you care about?

346
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:24,500
When you ask yourself today, like, can I depict the vision very clearly to my team of what success looks like?

347
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:28,100
So in six months from now by the end of the year, It's actually hard to do.

348
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:33,400
It's hard to do in simple words like I found, I find that you got to push.

349
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,600
You got to push on that and really think about it.

350
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:45,900
But once you have it, and it's Crystal Clear people find within themselves, unbelievable power to actually achieve it and drive towards it.

351
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:52,000
So I would say, l, capturing their vision and powering their teams toward an outcome that they can depict.

352
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,700
Clearly is a big transformation.

353
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,600
Way that we manage.

354
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,000
I suddenly saw a friend of mine and I certainly think wrap your.

355
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:16,300
I, the role of the manager is much higher and what I see, sometimes leaders getting wrong, it's coming because you have to get this balance, right?

356
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,200
One of being, not taking for granted as a manager.

357
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,500
What the goals of the team said.

358
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:26,100
As you said, rat flag into one sentence, what is that?

359
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:26,600
Your goal?

360
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,000
Your team for the next six months and how are you?

361
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Breaking it down and making sure all People just join your team and going in and out aligning to it.

362
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,300
So that's really important.

363
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:40,000
But it also what's really important is to give them autonomy, right?

364
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,200
And I think you mentioned it, right?

365
00:48:42,200 --> 00:49:21,500
Like people have what's so amazing about hybrid and remote is, you know, now I have teams where my team can pick up their kids, they can work other times they want, but you have to have trust that we have agreed to that mission and now just you can work out when that work is going to be done, and we have all agreed and you just Were it and so not you have seen some managers getting a little bit to control it controls controlling, so they want to control all the way from the start, all the end and the challenge really is course, sending the vision setting, the execution path, but then also empowering your team to fit in their schedule in their lives and getting the work done.

366
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:35,800
And if you have the right people that will always deliver well If I could add just one very quick thing to, this also is, it's very easy to overlook the emotional relationship, building component of management.

367
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:46,600
When you are remote, when you're in the office and you see each other physically, or you're sitting down the same conference room, you can, you can feel the energy and know maybe this is like very briefly.

368
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:54,200
If Me by like you can feel the energy that the other person is bringing into the room a lot more naturally easier when you're in person.

369
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:16,400
And, so I think it's something that I struggle with personally, as a manager is remembering to take that time to connect human to human with the person that you're managing, whether that's a social check-in your meeting, or pinging them on slack to see how they're doing or using a mental wellbeing, check in tool, or whatever way it is, remembering to keep those human connections going.

370
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,200
As you, it's very easy for me as a manager.

371
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,500
I will just only take accountability for myself.

372
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:29,700
It's very easy for me to get focused on the work and execution and saying, okay, we're aligned go off and do your thing.

373
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,000
I am going to go off and do my thing.

374
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:31,700
Let us come back.

375
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,600
We have shared goals.

376
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:38,600
This is all great, but then you miss that human connection element.

377
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:48,300
And if that doesn't come naturally to you, or it's something that you may be leaned heavily on, you know, running into each other in the company kitchen about Out.

378
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:57,000
You have to, again, be like very intentional about how and where, and when you Foster those connections such a great reminder.

379
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,600
I think that's a good segue, you know, hybrid work cloud-based teams, right?

380
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:10,100
They take different shape and different people based on where they are in their own life, experience, experience them differently.

381
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:22,800
So I know one of the concerns about this new model of work has been for Gen Z and weather early kind of Skill employees are getting the mentorship and training and upskilling that they need.

382
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,000
How do you think we solve for that?

383
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,100
Could I talk about intentionality again?

384
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:41,300
All right — functionality again, I know Justin is passionate about this topic so maybe over to adjustable I really I worried we worry about it.

385
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:56,900
A lot, you know, I think about personally, my experiences when I was younger as a graduate you learn a lot on the job and mostly mimicking.

386
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:57,400
Right?

387
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,600
You don't know what you're doing.

388
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,600
You're mimicking people.

389
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,200
You're mimicking.

390
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,500
How they prepare.

391
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,500
You see the other side and The Human Side of them, right?

392
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:17,100
You see them nervous before a meeting you just observe and watch and the work that other people put through put in.

393
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,000
And you can ask questions very freely bit more freely at those times.

394
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:32,500
And so we it is very fun of mine for us because Typically we have worked with highly skilled team staying.

395
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:33,900
Yes, you have.

396
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,100
We must have a common goal.

397
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:40,300
We must have a shared understanding, but typically they know how to problem.

398
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:59,800
Solve they know what they're doing when you're at least, when I started at work, I had no idea what I was doing and so for many years and for you know, when we go into this remote world it's and to When he came and ran from show, you would say the same thing.

399
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:09,800
It's 10:00 in tashjian, intentionality about putting a frame of the picture or these being addressed.

400
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:26,900
So, a practical example for that, you know, we're putting more mentorship programs, particularly for new starters and really I wouldn't call forcing it but making sure that we're checking in and seeing the feedback we're getting from my interns or a fresh grad.

401
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,300
Adds.

402
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:43,700
Secondly, we're bringing fresh Senna and turns much closer together, more often than we normally would have done, and we know we want them to share their experiences and much more cross collaborative way more often as well.

403
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,800
And I think thoroughly, it's just empathy, right?

404
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,200
Many of us have been in, you know where leaders we have been organizations as well.

405
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,900
We feel confident, our work Trails, we feel confident.

406
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,600
Coughing about switching between jobs and having that empathy around.

407
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:10,500
That's how I felt like when I was a fresh bread Jew, a tour when I was a fresh into and that's the off that Azul and I have given all this task.

408
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,400
Do you remember when you were 18 and you got given tasks and how you felt?

409
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:23,100
And now imagine you're at home by yourself and how that would have felt and making a follow-up Zoom call and saying, hey, how are you feeling?

410
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,700
Did you understand every thing?

411
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,900
It's okay, let us go.

412
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,300
Do it again and just being very empathetic to gen Z's because they're not going too necessarily.

413
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:40,400
It's not cool to talk about these things or say that loud, especially when you're just starting, just starting an organization.

414
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,200
We're off to do you want to jump in?

415
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:44,800
I mean, you.

416
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:52,300
You see right what's happening across so many different organizations ride from large organizations to small organizations.

417
00:54:52,800 --> 00:55:03,500
And, so I would love to hear, you know what lessons you're learning from all of those different organizations in terms of what they're doing and how they're deploying cloud-based teams.

418
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:12,500
Yeah, we have had the benefit of seeing hundreds of teams and deploying and it's absolutely right.

419
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,000
What Kim and Justin was what we're saying before.

420
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:36,300
There's this Mission focus and there's trust that are really key drivers and when and there's the surprising thing is like You can actually today like assemble some of the world's best product Builders to help team up with you on the most important outcome.

421
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:49,600
So there's literally we live in a world that is becoming more and more democratized that has provides much more access turns out really how skilled people are looking for the type of challenges that actually matters.

422
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,200
If you think you're doing something that can matter that's it.

423
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:53,900
Here you go.

424
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,200
You can actually do it because now the boundaries Of the four kind of logical.

425
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:13,200
Walls of the company are dissolving for the better and that's what the cloud has brought us with cloud computing and is now bringing us with teams and the whole stack of the company as a whole, becoming wider can move faster.

426
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,300
Power goes to the edges, creates a ton Ami and creates intention ality.

427
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:29,700
And I agree that's such a key word because If in the past, you know, culture kind of happened in the office, we thought we had it down but really we don't know.

428
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:41,000
We have to think it through and it presents this kind of New Foundation that helps address some of the problems that we have always struggled with their gen Z kind of upscaling.

429
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,300
And the asking problem, General has always been an issue.

430
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:55,700
Except when you have strong teams that are cross-functional, that bring diversity of skill, set of backgrounds where Talked about how that's how you can solve really big problems.

431
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:11,500
What A diversity, can also come at different levels of experience because sometimes if you have a team of really strong people, you can also have someone that ask the more basic questions and turns out the most basic questions may be very helpful so that you are getting stuck and don't take things for granted.

432
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,200
You may have taken for granted for a very long time.

433
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:41,900
So thinking deeply about our team's by identifying the core missions and outcomes within the organization and looking at the teams that Can drive those outcomes, helps structure the cloud-based companies and the fourth thing in companies to go into a new level of pace, a new level of potential of outcomes and driving products, and revenue streams and access to customers that were just impractical before that.

434
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,200
Well, and we didn't talk about this much today, but it's still a downturn going on.

435
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:52,700
And a lot of uncertainty in the, in the economic Times that we're in and iCloud is done.

436
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,600
Computers, you don't actually have to commit.

437
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,900
The way you had to commit with buyings bunch of servers and putting them in your office.

438
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:27,100
You can benefit from the flexibility that cloud-based everything bring you including cloud-based teams so that you can reduce overhead, increase your ability to be agile and Nimble and build with the capabilities that enable you to not just survive in those very crazy times, but actually find ways to is to move like and thrive in the way that no one could before.

439
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,200
So sadly we only have a few minutes left.

440
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:47,200
So maybe in closing, let us get back to some tactics to leave people with, so hoping each of you can share two things leaders can do today to accelerate their success with cloud-based teams.

441
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,700
Who wants to start?

442
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,800
I will start us off.

443
00:58:54,100 --> 00:59:11,100
So two things leaders can do one is get very clear on what your culture means because knowing what your culture looks like in practice will help you identify how you need to communicate how you need to work together.

444
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:15,200
How you what behaviors, you reward, but behaviors, you correct.

445
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,500
And that only becomes more important when you are fully.

446
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,300
Did hybrid just hybrid in the cloud?

447
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:34,500
And the second piece of advice is communicated early often in multiple locations multiple times a day.

448
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,500
You can you, you know, you're communicating too much.

449
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:44,000
When people tell you to stop telling you something and that will very rarely ever happen.

450
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,300
Cool.

451
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:45,900
Justin.

452
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,400
Sorry, not much time.

453
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,200
Left to things rapid fire.

454
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:58,500
OK, my two things that, you know, it's up to lead us to model the way and I will put the keyword of this session intentionality.

455
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:20,000
If I think, what ref mentioned a lot around diversity, there's no excuse not to work with different types of vendors, like, 18 stuff to bring diversity opulent and really realistic, you watch need done quickly and you as a leader have, Tim all the way and slowly build trust.

456
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,300
New methods work.

457
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:31,400
I think we had a little technical challenge there, but intentionality model the way Ralph over to you to close us out.

458
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,000
Yeah, I think intentionality definitely key word.

459
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I would say experimentation empowering teams like today.

460
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,500
Think about the missions and describe the outcomes.

461
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:47,200
You're trying to drive for your end of the queue for, for H1 next year.

462
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,300
And try to ask you the question, what is the right team for the job?

463
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,200
And now you have all kinds of ways to assemble this team, you can bring diversity of skill.

464
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:02,400
Set of abilities, of seniority of backgrounds, obviously, and many more and you can build in and you can keep exploring.

465
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:10,200
Ring new models for company building, that may change the game for you and your organization.

466
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,300
Very cool.

467
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,100
Well, thank you so much.

468
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,500
This has been amazing.

469
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,600
I wish we had more time to continue the conversation but please connect with the speakers.

470
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:29,800
I think all of their LinkedIn are in the chat and I know they'd all be happy to continue the conversation with you have a wonderful day.

471
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,100

Hey everyone.

I love looking at all your locations extremely distributed audience so that's a lot of fun.

42
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,700
I am here in Johannesburg.

43
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,100
We finally have rains celebrating that Latakia.

44
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:44,400
And I am VP of people at remote, we have gone through significant scaling in the last two years, and I am celebrating my two year anniversary at remote in December.

45
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,200
Hand it over T Rodrigo.

46
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,300
Hey Rodrigo, I am tuning in from Southern California where it's nice and sunny outside.

47
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,700
I work for a company at coat called torch.

48
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:08,900
People success manager over here were a remote first company where we really served to fuel professional growth through the power of trusted relationships and really on the for employees democratize access to coaching.

49
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,800
And then for companies really provide some powerful analytics on the back end to help produce like Roi.

50
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,200
So excited to be here today.

51
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
Awesome, thanks Rodrigo.

52
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,800
Laura amazing, thank you so much.

53
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,200
I am Laura the VP of marketing here at Loom I am joining from Colorado about 20 minutes, west of Denver's right?

54
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,000
At the foothills of the mountains, and Loom is a video communication platform for work.

55
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,400
So we help our connectedness among teams while also feeling a reduction in meeting by allowing teams to communicate via video messaging.

56
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,300
Love it.

57
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,800
All right, well before we jump into this discussion, I would like to pull up this Gallup stat that I had found.

58
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,100
So Katie, if you don't mind pulling that, you know, having the best friend at work is increased employees.

59
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,700
Workplace, net promoter scores during this post pandemic.

60
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:10,900
And so as you can see in 2021 2022 having that best friend at work a lot of folks, strongly agree that it can make a big difference.

61
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:18,500
This is in retention in having a thriving employee experience and communication, commitment, and ultimately outcomes.

62
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:33,000
And so, what I love about this discussion, Katie you can pull that down right now, we will Jump Right In what I love about this is we're not just talking about having a bestie at work, but there's actually productivity.

63
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,900
We're seeing that there're results from these surveys that Gallup has conducted in business outcomes.

64
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,900
It's in having these type of productive relationships.

65
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,500
So, I would love to unpack this conversation a little bit more with each of you.

66
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:56,900
How are you seeing the importance of building and maintaining strong workplace, relationships through the employee life cycle?

67
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,600
I will start Gina if that's if it helps the panel yet, I would love to hear from Laura and Rodrigo on this topic as well.

68
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,200
I think, for me, social connection is so much more, especially in a remote in hybrid environment, right?

69
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:22,600
And we also, remote first, I didn't mention that earlier, but like our name, we are absolutely remote first in more than 75 countries with more than 900 employees.

70
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,900
And I think that social connection leads to the ultimate as Of belonging.

71
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:38,299
And if you cannot be friends with people at work, or if you don't have that type of connection, it's really difficult to trust someone, if you don't really know them.

72
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:45,800
And if you don't actually have any interest and connection with them, so to me, it really starts on that.

73
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:53,200
It starts about the impact can really impact your culture, how you work day to day, how teams connect with each other?

74
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:02,200
I think behind that comes a lot of intentionality and will Speak a lot more about that in today's store but Katie a little bit from Laura's.

75
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,100
Well, yeah.

76
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:13,000
And I think that friends really hold you accountable and unintentionally kind of hold up a mirror of the value and the caliber of work that you're driving and producing.

77
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:27,700
So when you see your friends or at the very least, people that you empathize with or trust doing really great work, it inspires you and it also kind of gives you a template in a framework to do, your best work as well and at the end of the day, we have probably an easier time letting a business.

78
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,000
We have a harder time letting our friends down or the people that are relying in depending upon us.

79
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,800
And I think that's one of the Crux is for why it drives value from a business perspective.

80
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:44,400
But also friendships, just make us happier because we spend so much of our time at work on these little Zoom boxes and screens.

81
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,400
It's so important to also have fun and not just always kind of be grind in through it.

82
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,800
So right on, I guess the only thing I would add to that is I think that one of the most important things about friendships is that they had meaning to work.

83
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:13,000
I think working sometimes be a grind in regards to the tasks that you have but doing them alongside of people that you respect the you trust and then you build a sense of purpose with really adds meaning to the things that you do.

84
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:36,000
It allows you to once you build trust with people, you're able to come alongside each other because you know each other because you can see where your spread thin You need help where and specifically like, where one person might have a specific skill set, that needs to be highlighted and in turn things, that they're not good at taking off their plate, so that you can actually have the right, players on the team, on the field, doing the right things.

85
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,800
Yeah, that's how much of that scheana.

86
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:49,200
Now that Rodrigo mentioned that if you think about the world of remote work, hybrid companies in person companies, communication is usually at the core of everything.

87
00:10:49,300 --> 00:11:01,200
If you have great relationships with people at a social level and at a friendship level, the how, and the way you will communicate is just so different from you would with someone you don't know, right?

88
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,800
And so, it does actually unblock the communication gap, a little bit as well.

89
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,100
This is someone gets to know me, they will know.

90
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
How I talk.

91
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,200
Why you certain slang?

92
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,100
Living out here in Johannesburg?

93
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:27,800
And so it does actually, I think it does take a few barriers away when it comes to communication cultural differences because you take the time to get to know each other and so that can have a huge impact on asynchronous, communication and positive intent.

94
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:36,000
Because with friends, you're going to have that positive intent on a way higher scale than which you would with someone you absolutely just don't know.

95
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,500
So those Things come into play.

96
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,500
I think as well.

97
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:58,700
I think that positive intent thread is interesting and you know, at some point I would like to pull that a little bit more because I think there's so much misunderstanding that can happen while we're just seeing each other on slack as emojis or oh that person didn't respond to me within 5 minutes of my chat.

98
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,100
Like, are they upset with me?

99
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,900
You know, there's a lot of miscommunication that I feel can happen very easily as we're working in this remote circumstance.

100
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:20,400
So I guess across in thing about that life cycle, employee life, Cycle again, and each of you are our leading teams and hiring folks onboarding off-boarding folks right across that entire life cycle.

101
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,200
What are the key opportunities across and employees lifecycle Journey?

102
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,100
Do you see where you can help to as a manager?

103
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Build those moments of trust and encouraging building?

104
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,100
The right kind of relationships To me and Haley starts on the day you make an offer.

105
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:52,400
The moment you say yes to someone onboarding actually spots, it doesn't start in the day you start because there's such a nearly like a runner-up towards day one.

106
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:10,500
And so taking of a little bit of pressure Away by scheduling a, welcome call having an onboarding buddy, or if you have a cohort or something that intentionality is needs to be there for someone to feel, welcome and excited, and they cannot Pressure on them to schedule on day one.

107
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,400
If you say to someone, you need to schedule 5 coffee Chats on your first day.

108
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:34,100
Chances are they not going to schedule any because they weren't no way to start but if you take that pressure away and set them up for that first day before they join it, kind of sets them up for success, and they feel very comfortable you know to enter that first day I never start with a question about like so how's your first day been?

109
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,200
So tell me about leading up to day one like what's been happening?

110
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,400
In your life.

111
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:50,100
How is your, you know, how is your family, taking your friends, taking the news, and immediately start to get to know things outside of work, there might drop a pet name, you know, Etc.

112
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,600
And so I think it starts date.

113
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,000
It's also the hardest time because right?

114
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:03,700
It's like first day of school, first day of University College, whatever the case may be, is the hottest time but also the best time to start introducing that.

115
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:14,000
I completely agree and I think we talked about this too when we were catching up before even coming on here live but an onboarding buddy I think is so important as well.

116
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:25,800
Just it can be somebody that like isn't maybe going to work with them every single day to like you really want a pair like these cultural ads so you can bring life into people's work immediately.

117
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,100
So it's not just somebody that's going to be like telling them how to fill out a Google doc or create a template but somebody that can also answer those like where's the bathroom?

118
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,800
Jen's that they're not going to feel comfortable asking their manager, especially in a remote workplace because that would be super weird.

119
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:45,000
But like, you need people that can kind of feed off of each other build on each other and can teach them the language.

120
00:14:45,000 --> 00:15:04,100
Because any new company that you start at, you really are relearning, how to work relearning, how to communicate, everybody uses slack slightly differently, you might be in Threads or you might be in a lot of channels or everybody might just respond 121 and having somebody that can kind of show them the ropes and that way is how you really start to build an ingrained cultural.

121
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,500
Culture.

122
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,900
It's thinking about all the little things not just how work gets done, specifically from a project perspective.

123
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:20,500
I also think to your point Gina talking about off-boarding is also really important especially when you think about wanting to retain more people.

124
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:27,500
So if you have somebody that's leaving and you really didn't want them to you don't want to just like shun them or like ignore it.

125
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:37,600
This is like a really important time to build connections, Foster, ongoing relationships, and ideally, make sure that person is Champion and a cheerleader for you and your org from the sidelines.

126
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,100
Because friendships don't stop.

127
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,700
When you disconnect from your company.

128
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:48,700
Zoom, you want to build connections that are going to be Everlasting and Tech, or your industry is probably a pretty small town so to speak.

129
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,500
And those friendships and connections can only help our you and your future career.

130
00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:01,200
Wherever you, may go next, as well as continuing to drive insights, and valuable institutional knowledge for your company after that person has departed.

131
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,900
That's so good and huge.

132
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:12,000
On the off-boarding side I think is managers it's so easy to kind of fall under you, like, you don't know what to do.

133
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:21,200
And so it just kind of like an after it becomes an afterthought, a lot of times but really securing that off-boarding and celebrating even the transition.

134
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,300
And the decision of the person transitioning, I think is a huge win.

135
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Do you know, the only thing that I would vote add is I think that the other major point that relationship, screw, Credibly important is transition points.

136
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:59,100
You think about when someone gets promoted when someone moves into a different apartment we put all this emphasis on onboarding but it's almost like the way I have seen a frame sometimes like in boarding to a we put as much intentionality into helps helping someone transition into something bigger, something new like the first time someone manages people like those are big scary things which they're jumping into something new.

137
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:07,099
And so really being intentional about those times to really, really I think sometimes are one of the most I overlooked points in the life cycle of an employee.

138
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,000
So good.

139
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,200
I am actually going to pull in a question here.

140
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,900
I am seeing thank you everyone for dropping in some of these questions in queue.

141
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,700
A, let us actually pull in that first question from Riya.

142
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,200
Are there specific initiatives and programs?

143
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,099
You'd suggest organizations Implement to enable more work.

144
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,900
Friendships both in person and virtually.

145
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,000
So, I know we're getting a little bit in the, in, maybe a tactical idea here of initiatives.

146
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:45,900
But as we're talking about that employee life, All, what are some ideas recommendations that you have in these initiatives and programs?

147
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,100
I think a very simple one in the world of people is just leaving space in a budget for meetups.

148
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,000
So whether that is local International like whatever budget you have.

149
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:12,200
I mean we are in a year of sustainability and efficiency a lot of tech companies are, and so I know that people budgets aren't very stretchy but living space like whether that's 60, 100, 200 dollars for meeting up and having a meal together doing something fun together.

150
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:22,000
I have seen folks go on Hikes together, go, I had an experience with a remote We used our own budget to do hot air ballooning when they visited South Africa.

151
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,700
And it was such a cool experience, and it made me realize that budget.

152
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,900
I am not 100% sure.

153
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:34,100
I would have been able to commit to that amount in that sort of stage of my career when it happened.

154
00:18:34,100 --> 00:19:02,900
And, so I just think it's so important to make Financial space in your budget for it, like tactically and it up, it doesn't have to be a lot of money, so that's a nice in person initiative, but also gets very Tribute teams together in smaller locations especially if you're not doing a company-wide Meetup but there's so many other beautiful tools like take a child, take, you know, tools to get together virtually as well.

155
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:16,600
I sometimes laugh, when we get this question because it's like easy for all of us to say like we're VP is, were people leaders like making space intentionally for social interaction, we can do without the fear of any backlash.

156
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:38,000
I think that a lot of the times ice needs or first-time managers or people that are just more Junior in the org, don't feel like they have the space or the, okay, or the go-ahead to be able to just have a team virtual happy hour or, like, have a competition of who had the best Halloween costume and so being able to Set those examples and encourage the teams to set up those two.

157
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,400
That time is really, really important.

158
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:52,800
You can't just assume the team leads know that they can do that or that I seized conspiracy had that from the ground up like you do have to lead, by example, and you should remember to like clearly articulate that to your team's to give them the space.

159
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh that's yeah.

160
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:12,800
I think the only thing I would add to that is I think sometimes there's always the issue of like what we do, but I think sometimes the most important thing is to recognize why we do it and that's why I like one of the things that we have really found important is giving people opportunity to serve together and what comes about from that.

161
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,300
Like, for example, I got to brag on one of my co-workers.

162
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:33,900
Renee she launched kind of welcome like a culture team at our company, they call them culture Champs and, you know, they talk about Ways that they can celebrate, you know, hello is goodbyes, you know, big a big event, you know, but the bigger part of it, yes, those do things that produces things in the company.

163
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,200
But the biggest thing that happens is what happens among the team itself.

164
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,000
Once they are serving together, once they are doing things together, that is where the bond really is happening.

165
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,300
Is the way that they bond with each other?

166
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:54,000
So, the more that you can facilitate initiatives like that, that usually ends up being kind of just such a fertile ground for people to build friendships and really build development and develop.

167
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,600
You know, trust among each other.

168
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,700
That's powerful.

169
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:22,600
So there's a lot of lead by example that I am hearing there's some over communicating as managers as leaders that we need to do to make sure that our individual contributors are managers are all knowing that they have permission to be able to gather and come up with activities of gathering is there like a sweet spot number of in-person impromptu.

170
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,700
Gatherings that you have seen work, you know.

171
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
Like what's the right?

172
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:32,000
Cadence because you know some folks they're going to do a company Gathering maybe once a year.

173
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,900
Maybe there's some leadership, only Gatherings that happen throughout the quarters.

174
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,800
But is there a Cadence that you're seeing employees really responding?

175
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,000
Well to, you know, is there like an excess amount in a given quarter?

176
00:21:47,300 --> 00:22:04,900
We should have at least these amounts of asynchronous opportunities to meet along with maybe some virtual You know, I don't know if happy hours are still in but having social Gatherings virtually, like, what are you seeing as working and not working?

177
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:14,200
Nadia, I am so interested in here if you have a magic number on this one, but I feel like for me it's like a programmatic thing.

178
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:26,600
So anytime if I can feel the team is really stressed, or we have just done or in the middle of a really big project or work is starting to feel like all work, no, play kind of thing, even though that's the hardest time too.

179
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,100
Stop work for a social interaction.

180
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:38,000
I often think that's the most important time to remind people to come together to build friendships that have fun to talk about how hard it is.

181
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,200
Like it.

182
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:45,700
All these things don't have to just be like manifested positivity, like sometimes it is just being able to be like this is tough right now.

183
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:55,100
Like now let us have a virtual beer and getting to gather town or something like that just breaks it up and acknowledges what's really happening from a programmatic perspective?

184
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,600
I think it's like identifying those moments.

185
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,000
Pants as they happen is just as important as having things pre-planned.

186
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:11,400
I think, for me, social connection is also sometimes and especially if you want to build that deep connection, you really need to look at that team size.

187
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:24,400
Because if you're doing it, company-wide really hard, how people show up in front of people, they don't know, at 900 employees is, much harder than looking in team like five to 10 people.

188
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,400
And, so I really like doing something socially with the people team.

189
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,000
If I And twice a month.

190
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,600
If I can't once a month of yeast, that Cadence just works really well for us.

191
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Interesting fact, is our people meetings that Weekly at a stage was social first, and meet and work second, and that was our weekly.

192
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:53,800
People meeting everything else was soft, async we became better and better at solving hard problems.

193
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:00,600
Asynchronously, wherever (else) than doing it on a zoo call or virtually together that together.

194
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:07,700
Time became this fun card weight over the top, you know, opportunity and it never sat with me.

195
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:15,000
I realized that if I become a single source of failure to create social connection, I need to make sure the whole team is responsible for it.

196
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So we have to rotate the ownership of it, everyone in the team.

197
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,900
And if there's someone that truly doesn't want to do it, absolutely, they can reach out and go.

198
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,900
I need to skip.

199
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,600
This is way too much for me.

200
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:34,800
This is not something I am comfortable with and that works as well but I think we have created is Through the creative things people come up with a my brain space.

201
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:53,300
In terms of creativity has a limit, I have a lot of things to think about in one day, but the things my, you know, the people team came up with was so incredible and so fun, we lost week, we did a picture to play who's in our people, enablement team, and she asked for a picture of your fridge.

202
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,500
And you know, we did this like live meet.

203
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,700
I have been guess, like, who's very just that there was a name for it.

204
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,500
I can't remember the game, but it was like a nap.

205
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:09,600
It was so good and you know looking at people's fridges working at a remote company, our team is distributed in more than 10 countries just the people team.

206
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:21,600
It's really hard to get together but it created this like super weird connection about oh my gosh we use the same butter or, and I am on the other side of the world and so that devil of connection was really fun.

207
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:28,800
Also, how we crossed guest people that are similar and just realizing, oh my goodness, this person.

208
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,600
And this person did have some of the fridges We focus that.

209
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:40,600
So I think it's really about that lightness and doing it regularly, but the size of the group matters, meetups at a company.

210
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,000
This size in 75 countries is really difficult.

211
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It takes a year to organize it.

212
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,100
There's always inequity experiences, right?

213
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,100
Someone's going to have to fly for more than twenty-four, five hours.

214
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:59,500
And usually it's the crowd from Africa, the crowd from Asia, and a pack in Australia, New Zealand and that stuff.

215
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:06,100
And, so I think the pandemic halted a lot of in-person M, I would certainly like to see more of them.

216
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:20,400
I think the only thing that I would add to that is that aside from kind of the in-person Gatherings and stuff like that is the importance of just finding small ways to incorporate it into the rhythms of our everyday life.

217
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:30,000
Like I mean one of the things that we do for a lot of our teams is basically whoever's birthday it is they rotate like someone figures out like what's the favorite color?

218
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:41,800
Like what some favorite things, and then we just all come that day dress in a favorite color or like you know having a virtual background just little things like that are kind of Moving into the fabric of everything that we do usually ends up being really meaningful as well.

219
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,200
These are great ideas, Samantha and chats drop an idea.

220
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,700
We did something similar where on our Global employees screen, share Google Street View.

221
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,200
Yes.

222
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,100
And walk through neighborhoods.

223
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,100
Love that really good one.

224
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah, that's great.

225
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,200
Yeah.

226
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,900
If any of you have any other ideas that's working, please drop it in chat.

227
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,300
Thank you all for sharing these.

228
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:13,800
Yeah, these are ideas that I am like taking notes on, and we're going to figure out how to implement them with our team like today.

229
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:24,200
You know, going back to the point, Laura, you were talking about intentionality communication, like we need as Leaders to be examples to do this.

230
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:30,000
How are each of you intentionally championing friendships at work today?

231
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,100
Like, what is this?

232
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:36,000
Look like in your day-to-day in your month to month and your quarter?

233
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:47,700
You know I do think it is a lot of what we have talked about already like it is setting up and making space for it so it is making sure that all of your team meetings aren't just business down to business.

234
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,800
Like, you have to set aside space to have fun.

235
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,100
It is onboarding buddies.

236
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,100
It is celebrating Transitions and promotions and whatever it might be.

237
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:04,300
And making sure that everybody feels comfortable with that, it's all of the ideas we have had in the chat and then also it's allowing your team, the space to like, decide what they want to do themselves.

238
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:13,300
So, one of the things that we actually do is a quarterly quarter day here at Loom, so each of the sub departments to keep the team's a little bit smaller to Nadia's Point.

239
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:26,800
Get Pick a Friday that they come in for a quarter of the day, just to spend time together, socially, purely social, and then they sign off for the rest of the day and get to go live their lives and do whatever they want with their own friends or people in their lives, or whatever it might be.

240
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:33,800
And I think that's been a really great way to make space, not just for friendships at work, but friendships outside of work.

241
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:41,900
So you're consistently connecting with people around you in your life, without always having to be plugged in and on and responding to the millions of questions.

242
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,000
And I think that things like that are really important.

243
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,100
Similarly, there are people that I try to Champion when I see them doing really well for building up culture.

244
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,100
So if somebody drops like, hey, this is what I am listening to on Spotify.

245
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,600
In our marketing team chat, I will always send them a DM.

246
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,200
That's like thank you so much for like being such an advocate for building a culture here at Loom.

247
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,000
That's incredibly important.

248
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,800
I would love to see you continue doing that and almost always those people start building on one another.

249
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:20,300
And when one person is doing in that in the chat and it's not coming from a leadership perspective, because that always is, Like forced sometimes fun but it when it's like the ICS and the people that are creating this from the ground up, that's really.

250
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:26,000
When you start to see to Nadia's Point, like all of the creative ideas that you never would have thought of before coming to life.

251
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:35,200
So it is like making sure that you're praising people for being cultural Advocates, the same way you praise people for doing a really good job on a project hoof.

252
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,700
That's huge, you're talking about what you celebrate, what you encourage, what you don't as leader.

253
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:46,200
I think that's huge in indicating and just guiding the direction of the culture.

254
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,600
Any other thoughts Nadia Rodrigo.

255
00:29:49,800 --> 00:30:02,800
I love doing exactly that they're in a public, thanks Channel because not only are you like celebrating the person but all of a sudden, everyone else sees it and it's interesting how those things do manifest, because someone else use it.

256
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,300
And they like, yes, I needed that today.

257
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:19,500
I needed to see your French Bulldogs, like, do something really weird in a single call or, you know, I needed to see your kids like cycling or whatever the whatever you're into and I think it's like is a great space for it.

258
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,900
Formal communication.

259
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,600
I think the pandemic blood alliance you know so much.

260
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,900
We became formal communication.

261
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,800
And so if you don't make space for that thank you.

262
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:37,900
Like thank you so much for posting that amazing, you know, update or Spotify playlist or video or whatever.

263
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,400
And what I also like is we have an IRL channel.

264
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:55,300
So in real life looking at that is also manifesting something the amount of people that are clicking an emoji and saying, Like wow, I wish I was there is manifesting ideas of who should I meet up with?

265
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,900
How can I use my budget?

266
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:07,700
Like I need to connect with people, and so I am seeing interesting requests about, can I use my meter budget to do something virtually because I am not near anyone.

267
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,100
And so that's what other ideas for people in my seat to go.

268
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,400
Oh my goodness, there's some unfair Equity yet.

269
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,200
We need to figure out how to meet that person's needs.

270
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,700
And, so I think yeah is about Public thanking but I love that idea.

271
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:29,100
Laura, the only this one thing I will add about this connection ID.

272
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,600
So one-on-ones, this is not just about manages any.

273
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,000
I see you can do this as well.

274
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,900
Anyone and one that you start, if you start that with a question about.

275
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,100
So, Gina, let us say, your dog is, like, Luna and I go Gina.

276
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:53,300
How's Luna doing you mentioned, you know, Luna refused to go out for a walk last week, all of a sudden you're going to remember Amber that I remembered your pet's name and that they refused to go out for a walk.

277
00:31:53,300 --> 00:32:01,800
And it was so significant to you when you shared it with me, that, that, that builds, that one-on-one connection with leaders, and Isis, and peers.

278
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,900
And so at all levels, you start really manifesting connection.

279
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:18,300
And I think that's often missing in the world of Zoom not that product, the environment infrastructure just because everyone hates an agenda or like, you know, starts a DM with.

280
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,300
So what have your priorities In this week?

281
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,200
And we can all stare care of that and David until later in the course.

282
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,500
So to me, that's really important.

283
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,100
It's also that one-on-one time.

284
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
I love that video.

285
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,800
Paul told me, I will see you will see me around a message about something he purchased, or something.

286
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,500
He's kid did like a random photo of his kid to doing something.

287
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,900
You know, very random, very extreme, very cute.

288
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,700
And to me, I think that relationship at all levels is necessary.

289
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,000
It's just, it's not supposed to be just a joke.

290
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:56,300
It is supposed to be everyone that has that social connection with each other so good.

291
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,300
Yeah.

292
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:11,700
I think one of the things especially for companies that have gone from an in office setting to having to be remote or hybrid, I think we can easily fall into the Trap of feeling like we have to recreate the in office environment, and we kind of just have to come to terms with the fact that's not possible.

293
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,300
I mean there's a reason why I like you know Mark Zuckerberg is spending billions of dollars.

294
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:28,800
Drinking the metaverse was like we got to leave that to him, but we I think that there are ways in which we can look at the outcomes that come from in-person interactions and reverse engineer it from there and kind of building.

295
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,400
This s*** is around that, you know, like I think about like what happens oftentimes.

296
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,600
It's like if you're an in-person setting, what really happens is self-disclosure you end up being vulnerable.

297
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,600
You end up sharing your story and from that comes connection from that comes belonging from, that comes building a sense of trust.

298
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:53,400
And so, we have really leaned into creating avenues for people to Are their narratives because that doesn't always happen very naturally in setting.

299
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,500
So like one fun thing that we did is we launched this thing called me to Torchy.

300
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,900
Oh, we're basically we just do an interview, like it's really funny like basically it's like a 10-minute interview.

301
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:11,500
We asked him questions, you know, ranging from kind of like what kind of coffee they have in the morning to like who their best friend was in junior high to my personal favorite is I ask them.

302
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,600
You know if you were given a year-long sabbatical what would you do with that time?

303
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,100
And then we do a bunch of different settings.

304
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,000
We found ways to do it live during our Person retrieve.

305
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:27,000
We just did one that we just recorded, and we just dropped it in the, in the general Channel and it's interesting.

306
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:33,100
Basically, it's once you create that content where people are able to put out their story out there.

307
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:40,000
People build connections based on that, you know, like one of the people that we did a me to torture with was a gal cat.

308
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:46,900
And in doing that, I found out that she is a child of an immigrant and you and she was raised by immigrants and then that's my story too.

309
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,199
So we end up having a whole hour long conversation.

310
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,300
Just on that.

311
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,400
And that wouldn't have been something that we would have like, naturally.

312
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,100
Like that doesn't.

313
00:34:53,100 --> 00:35:02,700
Exactly come up in conversation, naturally, you know, and so providing Avenues to where people can intentionally share their stories really, really proves powerful and just making that stuff happen naturally.

314
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
That's so good.

315
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:19,000
The storytelling aspect are there any just tactical ideas in how you can facilitate you know, within your team Gathering of the stories and then sharing of them?

316
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,800
We have done like a trivia session.

317
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,200
We're starting Nadia.

318
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,400
Oh, we have done like a trivia session where I will DM the people on my team in the background and ask them random things.

319
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,000
Like, what is one weird thing that you have about food or opinion?

320
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:56,400
You have about food or tell me one embarrassing story from your childhood or tell me the moment that you're the most proud of and then I will put them all on a screen and everyone will try to like match who they think it is in the chat and then the person will reveal themselves afterwards and Give us more context about the story or the moment or whatever it might be.

321
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:08,000
And that's been a really fun and funny way to like, learn more about people's lives, without having them feel like they're a talking head, would just, like, spewing a story at somebody for five minutes kind of thing.

322
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,800
It adds, like some freshness to how they're sharing.

323
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,000
Love that.

324
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,200
Nadia did you have a?

325
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:27,300
Yeah I think it will hand is even a really nice time for storytelling and specifically stories that are meaningful to that person it can be about anything.

326
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:39,100
And, so I am actually considering implementing storytelling it remote in Q4 where instead of having like all hands and another update, we so good with a sink updates at remote.

327
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:44,500
I would love to leave a bit of space with someone can just share something that's happened this year.

328
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:57,900
And the outcome or the impact on them and again, we can bring different trains, we can bring different subjects, we can bring the fun side of it in but you know has remote work had a meaningful impact on your life has remote.

329
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:03,100
The company had a meaning for you impact on your life and so you start building a connection with someone else.

330
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,500
Who's going to listen to that story and go my goodness?

331
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,200
I can relate.

332
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,500
I have to set up a coffee chat.

333
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:14,700
This person exactly like Rodrigo said he found that connection with someone that I didn't know existed and that was accidental.

334
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:26,600
All right, and so in a remote company you need to find a way to set up accidental connection and that's a great way to do so, you know, two things I would throw in on that.

335
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,900
I think one of the things that becomes really, really important in.

336
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:40,300
This is to make room for different temperaments because like we have had a very intentionally look for ways for introverts to be able to, you know, engage with this you know, because obviously we're going to do an in-person interview.

337
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,900
Like I remember when I was talking to folks to do them at all Retreat, you know, one Was a great candidate for.

338
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,400
It's like, there's no way I am going to be standing in front of 160 people.

339
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,300
That I have never met telling my story and that really.

340
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,200
So that's why we end up also doing ones that are written out and put them out in the newsletter.

341
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,500
So like really making, you know, avenues for different folks on that.

342
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,800
One thing that our company did that was incredibly powerful.

343
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,500
We just had our in-person Retreat and Utah in our CEO.

344
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:14,600
I am sorry one of our co-founders LED this really it was kind of like life story Workshop.

345
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,400
To where people were able to sit with their, with their story, reflect and kind of create chapters to their story.

346
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,500
And then there was three different sessions that they did ten minutes.

347
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,400
Each the first one was going over a high point.

348
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:31,700
Second one was going over a turning point that it was going over a low point, and they were just able to share with each other on that.

349
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,400
But I think the most important thing about that one is that it was modeled by the top.

350
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,300
Are you know, a co-founder was able to share his story first?

351
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:47,600
So he was able to say hey here's what it looks like and secondly Like you was a really able to model like guardrails.

352
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:55,900
If you will like you went through this whole thing about kind of like the scale of vulnerability, you know like one to ten, you know, here's under, sharing here's oversharing, here's kind of where you want to be in the middle.

353
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,900
So creating those buffers.

354
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:05,900
And really that modeling really, really went a long way to people feeling comfortable, sharing their story and really engaging and it was incredible.

355
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,600
The kind of connections that were built by people.

356
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:14,700
The level of self-reflection that happen and kind of just, it was really exciting and, you know, and we're looking at ways to do that.

357
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,800
We as well because you know in person thing is a little difficult.

358
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
So yeah, that was one thing that came up for us.

359
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:27,700
What I am hearing is the theme of just humanizing one another that's like yeah, it's the bottom line.

360
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:34,300
Like, I think we have missed that when we were in person and just always in the office you know, 23 years ago.

361
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:47,300
And now as we're trying to adjust to figure out how to work asynchronously, a lot of those human, just basic components, get lost in the interactions.

362
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:53,300
And so being intentional and I think articulating and In those things out is so important.

363
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,900
And I am hearing a lot of that lead, by example that over communication.

364
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:05,100
It almost feels like you have to over communicate, even ten times more than you did when we worked in person.

365
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:05,800
You know.

366
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,100
So yes, thank you for sharing those ideas.

367
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,600
I want to jump right into some of these Q&A questions.

368
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,700
We have one, that's been upvoted from Dan mohel.

369
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:24,400
Katie, if you don't mind, putting that on stage, I have read push back to calling workmates family, it can get toxic, we're all family.

370
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:31,500
We work late while making business decisions like replacing people, how do we balance the idea of friends?

371
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,400
While remaining professional great question.

372
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,500
Anyone.

373
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,100
Yeah, I don't think work is.

374
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,800
I don't think your family work with you.

375
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:51,900
You're not going to off-board a family member, you're not going to have a very Frank or difficult discussion with them, or maybe you would, but I think it's harder to do it with someone family.

376
00:40:51,900 --> 00:41:02,100
And with, I think when you call someone family, it does blur the lines of the relationship boundaries were really important at work.

377
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:19,100
I have met people and work that I am absolutely best friends with To the state, whether we work at the same company anymore, not and I think those relationships to time and how much I shared in the beginning, versus how much I would share with them in my life stage now is very, very different, right?

378
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:32,900
But I think it's about the our boundaries and I think what you're sharing and that vulnerability, I love that God real story that Rodriguez s*** about storytelling with God, rails, and reflecting and showing up for that.

379
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,400
You can write a guideline of, you know how friendships at work.

380
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,100
Work.

381
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,500
You can open source it for amazing other companies like all of us.

382
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,800
And then we can, you know, all share that experience.

383
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,200
But I think it's important to have guardrails and place.

384
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:52,300
And I don't think you work with your family, unless you really do unless you're a small start-up and have a bunch of having rivers, but I think it is.

385
00:41:52,800 --> 00:42:00,700
These are your colleagues and your friends and there's a difference, I love looking at the comments and Sandra.

386
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,600
I think you hit the nail on the head to where the imagery of Team.

387
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,900
Oftentimes, it's so much better than family because yeah, like Lee like you're, you know, for lack of better term.

388
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,700
You're stuck with them like it's a, it's a permanent relationship.

389
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,400
When you think about the imagery of team, it's all about.

390
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:31,000
Do you have the right people on the field and there're times to where someone is the right person on the field for a season but things change and now and then someone else actually becomes a better fit for that and having that framework to where everyone has the Viewpoint of what's best for the team.

391
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,800
What's going to produce us winning?

392
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,000
Then it doesn't become as personal, you know, like maybe I am for a season.

393
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,200
I was right person for this position, but then things changed and I had to move to another position.

394
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,000
So having the image of Team feels a lot more healthy than the imagery of family.

395
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,400
I completely agree with that and was going to use like a really similar metaphor to talking through it.

396
00:42:52,400 --> 00:43:12,600
But I think that it is so important to understand that, like, when you are part of a business, ultimately the businesses survival and the, what's best for the business is the only thing that matters and that like, sucks to hear, especially in a community like a Station where we are talking about humanizing things and it is important to bring human elements to work.

397
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,200
But at the end of the day you are all there so that this business can survive and so it can hopefully Thrive.

398
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:34,400
And unfortunately when we look at the macroeconomics today, when we look at what's happening in the world, the perspective of what businesses needed, three months ago, one year ago are all incredibly different, and we're seeing a lot of really hard change happen to companies right now and that's not personal.

399
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,700
That's not you excommunicate somebody from I am your family, it really is just you have to take people out of it.

400
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,500
When you are making really, really difficult business decisions.

401
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:50,500
And when you're making decisions about your family, you can't take people out of it because people are at the Crux of it, and that's the core difference.

402
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:56,300
Now, what I will say is like that gets harder and harder As you move up in your career when you are.

403
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:05,800
And I see I actually think it's okay to have like your fam of people that Empower you, that are your peers at work because you're not making decisions about their well-being.

404
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,200
How long?

405
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,300
They're Be staying at the company how well they're going to do or delivering performance reviews.

406
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,200
Having hard conversations or having to have the ultimate hardest conversations about exiting a business.

407
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:27,800
I think it's okay to like rely on your peers and I do think a lot of those friendships transcend, the business, a lot of the times and you're making decisions that impact those friendships and that work group.

408
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:36,200
Now, that's should stay at like a peer level, sometimes those things change, people get promoted and then, unfortunately, that will rupture change the friendship.

409
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,900
And Some kind of meaningful way, but that's kind of the game that you're playing.

410
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,400
When you are building friendships at work.

411
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,100
It does just look quite different from building, friendships from somebody.

412
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,300
You met at your yoga class or whatever?

413
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,000
It might be, there are different.

414
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,000
There're different steaks.

415
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:53,800
Very good.

416
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,500
Clarifications yeah.

417
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,000
Wow, I am like taking all these mental notes here.

418
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,500
I will be able to re watching the recording and definitely jotting down the notes.

419
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,500
We have got another question here from Hamza.

420
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:16,200
How do we mitigate or prevent biases unconscious implicit bias when they are healthy friendships at work?

421
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,300
That's such a meaningful question and it's so hard.

422
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:34,700
I think it's really hard in the role of managers and any one of the people team because if you have that framed in another team, how you need to make decisions about that has to remain unbiased.

423
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:44,300
You have got to keep that intact and I it's never ever easy but very often when I need to make really difficult decisions.

424
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,600
I put everything aside and have a good fact.

425
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,500
Because that is going to tell me what's really going on.

426
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:57,600
So if someone is underperforming, and we have provided feedback and there are a friends of mine, we are going to have a hard conversation.

427
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:03,500
Because factually there's a problem, and so I think that's also leads back to the family comment.

428
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,600
It's much harder to do that with family.

429
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,400
It's way easier to do that in a team setting.

430
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,800
And so, it is really about the dynamic of again, in Oro, City saying, you know, it's about the business.

431
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,800
I see it in three ways.

432
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:25,200
Actually, it's about the business, it's about the customers but the people do't work for the business and it doesn't work for the customer and it doesn't work for the rest of the people.

433
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:34,000
There's a problem and so that often helps remove the bias Factor just because you need to look at it from those three angles and not from any other ankle.

434
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:43,700
But yeah, it can be really difficult if you really close to someone, especially during the stage of the economy and for what companies are going through right now.

435
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,500
It's also super important always to like trust yourself.

436
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:56,100
Trust your instincts, look at the facts, but sometimes when you do know, there is a bias involved, you cannot just trust yourself.

437
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:13,100
Even if you think your objectively looking at the facts, I often think that there are times when it's really important to bring in a trusted Confidant or trusted Confidant who maybe are closer or have other contacts or other perspectives that are not skewed by your own personal biases, whatever that might be, that could be friendship.

438
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,400
That could be recency bias.

439
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:31,600
How recently, You started working with this person, whatever that might be you might need to get other qualitative opinions that are equally as important as the quantitative before making some kind of decision or whether that be positive or negative for somebody that you have a perceived friendship at work.

440
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:43,800
Now, the only thing that I would add to that too, is the importance of feedback loops, you know, be they Anonymous be, they, you know, providing a really safe place where people can come tell you directly.

441
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:50,500
Well I think that with that too is to everyone's Point making sure that we understand that.

442
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:56,300
That doesn't, that information doesn't may not necessarily control where we go, but it does provide context for it.

443
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,500
It's a data point.

444
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:04,300
It's something that we need to take in and self-reflect about and let that be, you know, add to the conversation that we're having in situations.

445
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,000
This is great.

446
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,300
All right, I am going to keep going through these questions.

447
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:21,000
We have one from Sarah and this is touching a question that we may have sort of answered earlier, but what are some of the top ways to facilitate bonding?

448
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:29,800
So if you were to identify, here's the top one, two, three things that are working right now, with my team, what are those things?

449
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:42,900
I will start, I think one to me is accessibility rodrigue or touched on it when it comes to introverts.

450
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,900
We have a whole world of difference at this stage, right?

451
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,800
No matter where you work.

452
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,300
There's a complete world of difference.

453
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,200
And so was that difference comes nearer, diversity.

454
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,200
Introverts and extroverts.

455
00:48:54,200 --> 00:49:02,500
It comes so many cultural differences that some folks might be comfortable with, and completely uncomfortable with, or not even normal in their cultural country.

456
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:15,500
And so on, I think it's really important that you have a fiery nicely documented process or I would lean into documentation have a guideline on how to do social connection.

457
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:22,400
One to create accessibility for all these amazing people, we have got V RF remote.

458
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,200
Not a lot of people enjoy it, but we do engineers really do enjoy it.

459
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:31,800
But they also have folks in our growth marketing team that really enjoys it and in the people team and another team's.

460
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,400
So I do see that as a completely different.

461
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:40,800
Bonding opportunity, they live in their Avatar and that's how they connect and bond, and they know each other's avatars.

462
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,800
And so making space for accessibility for those different groups and different individuals in your organization and different cultures.

463
00:49:48,100 --> 00:50:00,800
I think is incredibly important and my third one, I am going to lean in to say go lead by example, you have got a shot for that sharing being vulnerable at executive leadership level manager level.

464
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,900
And then with your peers, Yeah, I love that.

465
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:14,900
The only thing you didn't say they're Nadia that you have said before that I think is also equally important is remembering the personal details.

466
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:22,900
Like I really do think it is so important that if someone tells you something personal about your life like actually make an effort too intentionally.

467
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,600
Remember the pet's name, the partner's name, how many siblings?

468
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,600
They have whatever it is that they felt like sharing.

469
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,900
That's often an extreme moment of vulnerability at work.

470
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,600
So like don't take that for granted.

471
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,600
Absolutely.

472
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:42,700
I would also say like really setting the precedent of encouraging people to take it off of slack.

473
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,500
I think like we had a previous place.

474
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,700
I worked, we talked about like level one and level two conversations to we're level one.

475
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,700
It's just what happens every day like, you know, just back and forth.

476
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,800
And really it's anytime you have a communication that's not necessarily up for interpretation.

477
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:10,500
But anytime that goes above that hop on a call, you know, do a quick like, you know, Zoom meeting, you know, do use those funny little like chat features that Have in slack, you know, just because if you look at the statistics, I mean only 7% of communication actually happens.

478
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,100
Be of the words that are said, the rest of it is all tone and body language.

479
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:21,600
And so in the absence information we fill in the blanks and so really encouraging people to hop on those calls is really, really helpful.

480
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,000
And then, the other thing is really weaving it into the day-to-day.

481
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,700
Those finding those small ways for it to happen, and not relying on the big ways solely.

482
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:46,700
You know whether it's like, we're Going about, you know, in everyone saying remembering those details for when it comes to birthdays, you know, doing those virtual backgrounds, like those small ways, add up quite a bit and especially if they're kind of happened again and again, and again in the fabric of the day.

483
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,600
So good, thank you, Dan mohel.

484
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,800
Has another question here, work-life balance question.

485
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:01,300
How do L Foster friendships, while not cutting into personal time?

486
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,700
This is what the idea I said, earlier, about forced fun.

487
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,800
I feel like and naughty.

488
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,000
I think I always knew this to you, I am so sorry.

489
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,500
Lord, I want you to always do not talk.

490
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,100
We always want to talk at the same time.

491
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,200
No, I prefer.

492
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,000
It is.

493
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:23,100
You go with this and I agree, so I am going to give yes, I think.

494
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:30,300
All right, and then we will hand it back to you because I am sure you're going to add on to it too, but I think the idea of forced fun is really difficult.

495
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:38,400
Like if you're forcing your team to join a happy hour during the time that they're usually putting their kids to better bed or trying to make dinner or something like that.

496
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:45,200
That's when you start showing that you're not making fun accessible and you're not making friendships accessible to these people.

497
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,900
We have to be thoughtful about cultivating relationships at work.

498
00:52:49,100 --> 00:53:00,100
During work hours and understanding that it's just as important to build space for culture and cultural and connection to be happening as it is for them to get projects done during work hours.

499
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:15,000
So you're making time for social behaviors, should not happen on the weekends or when these people have already set their, like, I am I don't take meetings during these hours types of things like you have to think about prioritizing these hours, while these folks are at work, how do I do natya?

500
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,400
Really, really well.

501
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,400
And like time zone inclusivity is a thing, right?

502
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:34,100
So exactly what you said, if, if you distribute a teams are hard and the one day I tend to stay away from for social activities, especially considering I have a lot of folks in a pack at remote is Friday's?

503
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,300
Just because if you're doing something on a Friday, you are eating into someone's weekend.

504
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,300
And that someone could be 10% of your organization.

505
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,000
It could be one.

506
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,100
It doesn't matter.

507
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,500
So I agree.

508
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:53,800
I think what it comes to time zones and this, like, not cutting into personal time, it is about sharing the load.

509
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
If you join a company that is this distributed where I am at, you have got to understand.

510
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
There will be times when you have got to lean in, but there has to be times when the other person is going to lean into.

511
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,300
And that I share that feeling about social connection as well.

512
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:17,400
So maybe this week, we have a social time for very earlier mayor, Ed back overlap but next this week we're going to have a man.

513
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,400
Erica saw the lab.

514
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:29,800
So I think it is a little bit about sharing the experience and knowing that it is going to be different part of the future of work, but time zone inclusivity is so important.

515
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,500
Scheduling something at someone's 6 AM is going to be awful.

516
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,500
They are not going to show up excited and ready for a beard happy hour.

517
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,100
So they'd much rather have a coffee.

518
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,400
So yeah, I agree.

519
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,300
Yeah.

520
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,200
You know, I have actually always struggled with that term work-life balance.

521
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,200
I have always found it.

522
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:56,600
Much healthier to view it as a work-life rhythm, because balance.

523
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,300
Always, you know, it communicates.

524
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,400
Everything is always the same.

525
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,400
Everything is always static and that isn't true.

526
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,300
You know, it's like you think about, like, what makes a song?

527
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:03,900
Good.

528
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,900
Sometimes it goes fast, sometimes they go-slow.

529
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:23,500
But that's actually what makes it that rhythm is, what makes it, you know, a good song and understanding those rhythms of our life, like we have had again like As everyone's, you know, alluded to like my on my team were across like a bunch of different time zones, and we have to understand everyone's rhythms.

530
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:30,000
I remember when I was joining the team, it was right as I was about to become a new father for the first time.

531
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:37,400
And I was talking to one of my co-workers and I remember when she was asking me how I felt about it and, you know, said a bunch of stuff in somewhere in there.

532
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:43,200
I said, I just want to make sure it doesn't disrupt my work, and she said, hey, stop right there because that's the wrong way to view it.

533
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:48,000
It's like, because we really have come to see that It's just all continuous like it's all part of the same thing.

534
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,800
There's going to be times when your kiddo is going to cry and you need to get up and you know go be with your kid over there, going to just jump in the middle of a meeting.

535
00:55:55,100 --> 00:56:01,100
And having that Grace in awareness of each other's Rhythm, has proved Monumental and how we engage with each other.

536
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:03,900
Wow.

537
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,700
So rich.

538
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:09,100
I feel like we could continue talking for another hour, but believe it or not.

539
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,900
We have 5 minutes left with our time together.

540
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:22,100
And the questions have come through All the insights have that have been shared are so amazing, you know, one question that I still have that.

541
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,300
I just quickly wanted to go around with is are there any tools?

542
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,400
Are there any processes?

543
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:41,400
We have touched a lot of different ideas here, but are there any tactical tools that you see teams can start using today to be able to build productive, strong relationships?

544
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,600
I think we have said a lot of them and I do think a lot of them are like the obvious ones, like it's like Zoom.

545
00:56:50,600 --> 00:57:00,700
Like, do take things off slack to Rodrigo's Point earlier, like bring your body language and your face and how you're trying to communicate things, especially if it could be easily.

546
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:07,200
Misinterpreted, if you're delivering hard news, if it's something that requires like decision-making, like, don't have that.

547
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,200
Be an asynchronous communication like think about other ways that you can personalize it shames.

548
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:22,800
Self promotion of loom once again, but I do think that bringing like your face and your body language and your tone to what you're saying is super, super important, and we tend to get really lost in slack.

549
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,800
A lot of the time.

550
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:29,400
I also think there are fantastic tools to Nadia's point about creating these channels where you're giving shoutouts.

551
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:42,200
There are tools like bonus lie that exists, where every person at your company gets, you know, ten to twenty dollars a month, and they're able to give those dollars out as think use or congratulations or celebrating people.

552
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:53,700
Apple, it's a fantastic way to build and drive culture and its way that your tangibly making more money or like getting bonuses for doing good deeds or for connecting with people or for helping out a pier.

553
00:57:53,900 --> 00:58:03,100
And I think that not only helps Inspire like connection like these moments of recognition for folks but it also just creates a more collaborative and inclusive work environment.

554
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,900
We love bonus lie, we use it as well and Loom.

555
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:12,400
Yeah, I think to Laura's point we have mentioned a ton.

556
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,200
I know when that we use a lot is whisk.

557
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:28,700
It's like a social network that specifically tailored around work, but one of the things I keep coming back to is like I am reminded of like, you know, when the space race was first happening to the Moon, you know, like they had to solve the problem of, how do you write in you know, zero gravity, you know, in the u.s.

558
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:34,300
Spent like millions of dollars and thousands of man-hours building a pen that can write a 0?

559
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:41,700
In the Russians, just use the pencil and sometimes like the simplest approach is the easiest, you know, and it's right in front of our face.

560
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:59,000
Be, they emojis be, they virtual backgrounds be they everything that we have talked about today don't feel the need to always have to rely on that Silver, Bullet of Technology when you know because that oftentimes the Vols money and involves time and it's okay to, you know, to use the products that you have.

561
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,200
And yes, Laura, that's actually how I fell in love with loom.

562
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,200
Is that same thing?

563
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,200
Sad.

564
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:16,500
Say I will add one thing that's going to nearly take this on a different straight but just like a thought the more integration and automation you do no matter what team you have.

565
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:21,300
People team like any team that's doing tactical, operational administrative work.

566
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:26,900
If you can use the right Tech tools to integrate and automate those stuff so that no one is sitting and doing data.

567
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,800
Capturing, there is so much more time for engagement.

568
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,100
I find that especially in the people team.

569
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:47,600
So what I find is, if I do that and get rid of like uman data, capturing very heavy, administrative tasks, my team can have space to be more creative and show up for Theory engaging conversations.

570
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,800
But this is not just the people team, it's across the whole book.

571
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:57,000
So I love HR, Tech and integrating an automating stuff, and leaning on my Engineers for help.

572
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:06,900
Love it and I think Laura you summed it and chat, you can't automate human connection, it's got to be manual, it's got to be intentional.

573
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,900
So with that, we're going to wrap up our time.

574
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,000
Thank you so much.

575
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:19,300
Nadia Laura Rodrigo, for sharing your time, your insights, your presence with us today.

576
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:25,500
Thank you everybody who attended in chat, your engagement, you have been present with us as well.

577
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:34,300
And though, we're all virtual I can feel the connection with each one of you and it's very special so have a wonderful rest of your day.

578
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:42,300
You know check out we have got a couple of other Spotlight interviews that we're going to be doing over the next few weeks.

579
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:48,300
And we have got Alex from first base Brooke from Loom and Mattea from tight form.

580
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:55,700
And we're going to dive deep actually into their stories and journeys of how they got to doing what they do in B2B marketing.

581
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:03,200
And also here, there Their expertise and wisdom in what they're learning is working with not working in their practices.

582
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:10,200
So with that thank you all so much and I look forward to seeing you at our next event.

583
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,100
Alright, have a wonderful rest of your week.

584
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:12,600
Bye.

1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,300
Kanikapila in the old Hawaiian way.

2
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:40,900
We do it from the mountain, to the ocean, from my Windward, to the leeward from now, I will do lives.

3
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,900
From now on, we will do the leaves.

4
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,700
Go Grandma's house on that.

5
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,700
We can clean your.

6
00:00:50,700 --> 00:01:10,500
If we don't know where my God, oh my God, from the mountain, to the ocean from my window.

7
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:25,000

As we're diving into Alex's Journey, his story and ultimately what?

21
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:22,400
All of us are curious about is the LinkedIn phenomena that first space had where they were able to get their first 100 customers just through Linkedin as their sole marketing channel alone within 18 months.

Absolutely.

30
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:57,300
So we had to have the Aloha Island Vibes because, you know, I am actually out here in Hawaii right now, and I am in Ewa Beach because my husband's from here, but I am from La.

31
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:06,500
So I am still learning about the Aloha Spirit and the pigeon accent, and even how I pronounce Hawaii.

32
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,000
Like it's with a like a V pronunciation.

33
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
Write the W?

34
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:11,800
Yeah.

35
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,700
If you're strictly speaking.

36
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,100
Yeah, be Hawaii.

37
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,600
Actually have a lot Hawaii.

38
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:23,100
Like, if you see it spelled out there's like a little accent kind of apostrophe after the first.

39
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,200
I so but you know, people argue, no say it, the normal way.

40
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,800
Awesome.

41
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:40,500
Well, test is when you're driving down the highway in your life, What's kalanianaole you like the all the, all the syllable vowels, right?

42
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,500
Totally.

43
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
I butcher all the names.

44
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:51,000
So still learning over here but you're from Hawaii, and we have a quick little poll that Katie in The Green Room.

45
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,600
Our producer.

46
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,200
Thank you for pulling that up.

47
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:06,600
How many of you have visited, Hope Hawaii, feel free to drop in about they're not yet or yes you have Gone ahead and drop your votes.

48
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,600
All right.

49
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,100
Oh, here we go.

50
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Awesome.

51
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,300
So we have got a good chunk of folks who have Vince of Hawaii and also a good number who haven't yet.

52
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,200
So we're kind of even here.

53
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,800
I mean with that Alex, you actually grew up in Hawaii what part?

54
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,200
So I grew up in a hunter Lulu which is, so I am a city boy in Hawaii terms.

55
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,500
Yeah, for sure we got the tunes.

56
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,600
I was looking all the landscape shots as I was kind of putting me in my feels because it's yeah, it's a beautiful place.

57
00:06:47,700 --> 00:07:02,300
It is and you actually went to Punahou which is a private high school here on Oahu and I had to throw Obama's face on it because Obama went to Punahou, right?

58
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,100
Yeah, right.

59
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,800
He was in the class before my older brother who also want to go home.

60
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,400
So I mean, I never crossed paths with my brother did, but he was not obviously was not famous.

61
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,300
Then he was known as Barry at school.

62
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,100
So you know, he's just like another kid, totally it's.

63
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:27,000
But when you were going through school you know I guess it had he been known, yet I guess not yet, right?

64
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:33,400
Totally, not totally not yeah, we're looking at now is the love as an Alum though.

65
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,800
Is it a big deal to be a Punahou Alum and like Obama went there as well?

66
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:52,200
You know, it's funny for sure that I think the school super proud of that as you would be, you know, it's funny because our class, my graduating class.

67
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,700
But now has another celebrity that they're kind of attached to from the clouds, which is carry out.

68
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,100
Another was one of the judges on Dad's.

69
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:09,400
So it was like, wow, these little sort of celebrity connection that I take precedence in a particular class.

70
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,300
Super fun.

71
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,000
All right.

72
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,300
Well, I would love to dive into three parts for this time together.

73
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,600
And, you know, first diving into thank you for sharing the little bit of the Aloha.

74
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:48,700
But diving into your background, your story, your journey about all of this, you know, you're a Serial startup marketing leader and so you know, just walking through a little bit of that journey and then going into the big question that we have around how first base was To get its first 100 paying customers will go into that through Linkedin as an engine.

75
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,500
And then finally, we'd love to wrap it up with just some sort of point of encouragement for the group that we have here.

76
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:07,400
So let us start with your story and if you could just track back and walk us through first of all, like you got to be a little crazy To Be A Serial startup leader.

77
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:17,200
I mean you have been through multiple vc-backed startups building the marketing Ian, can you walk us through a little bit of your Tech background?

78
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,800
Yeah, sure.

79
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,900
I mean, I think, you know, I stumbled into startups relatively early in my career, you know, you know.

80
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:35,800
And as a marketer one of the things you know, I think about it as I didn't start a, I didn't start out intending to go into marketing per se was a little bit journey to get into that.

81
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:56,200
I was actually in the field, you know, Solutions engineer and then kind of morphed into and then I kind of Not that I wanted to be kind of in the morning, the center of things and there was doing like tactical marketing and then, but I will end in a start-up where I ended up owning a product line that I had to kind of do everything for, you know.

82
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,900
And, you know, went through an acquisition.

83
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,600
It was my first sort of, like, eye-opener of like, oh my gosh, you know, this happens in startups, right?

84
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:27,000
And, you know, and from there, I think, you know, journeying through a product management, a little bit of segments of product management, and then I Think I got a taste of the marketing side because I started owning product marketing, you know, and then it just sort of dawned on me that I really, really liked that aspect of the work I was doing.

85
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,500
I mean, not putting on product management enjoyed this, my stent in it but it's a very, very, very process-oriented thing and you know it has its own world.

86
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,700
I love the fact that you know, you know.

87
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,300
And I was already at that point doing startups, right?

88
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,100
And experience all the ups and downs.

89
00:10:46,500 --> 00:11:01,200
That you have in startups like a start-up start an emotional rollercoaster, basically, right at the marketing, part of that, what was fascinating for me is saying, like, Okay, well, how do you actually boot up the connection to, to the market, right?

90
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,500
And in, and I start off in B, to B and B to B is itself.

91
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:12,500
A very to be startups, are a particular, kind of marketing as anyone who does it know.

92
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:25,300
It's As much there's as much intuition as data because your sample set of what you're dealing with and customers like your daily with maybe dozens and then hundreds and that, you know, you're not dealing with like okay.

93
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,300
We have a, you know, a million people interacting with the brand, right?

94
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:45,900
So it's I think that sort of intuition and content and how to create that connection to the market was really fascinating for me, especially because in a start-up environment, usually start Founders or Like you know, how do we do this?

95
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:57,600
It's the it's often times at least known discipline for Founders because they tend to come from a technical background and that's one of the joys and challenges of being a B2B marketer and start out, right?

96
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,800
That's right on.

97
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,800
Can you walk us through some of the journey?

98
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:13,400
Like, well, we're different tech companies that you have had the opportunity to work with and, you know, just even to describe a little bit of, like the engines that you have had.

99
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,100
You build over time?

100
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,200
Yeah, I mean, I first kind of marketing leadership get came in a company called package design.

101
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:34,200
It was started by a Serial entrepreneur and, you know, it was is one of those situations where there's probably like, you know, like 20 people I have started at multiple companies that pretty small, right?

102
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,100
First marketer kind of walking in the door.

103
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:48,400
Maybe there's a few things written by an enterprising salesperson or someone else that sort of thing or you know someone else who owns And marketing, but it was like, we need someone to go do this and yeah.

104
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,700
So this was a while ago.

105
00:12:50,700 --> 00:13:01,900
So marketing Tech was very nascent, you know, Mark has exploded as we know and there's like a bazillion tools to choose from now and everything, you know.

106
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:13,400
But, you know, in the sort of the naissance of that flick, how do we actually just got to be a be effective online with web, with SEO, you know, just the, the foundation's is where I started with that.

107
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:20,500
They first automation stack, I went to an Israeli startup called quali actually.

108
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:34,300
We rebranded I came there to go from that first start up, and we grew up and then basically went to an Israeli startup called quali and had a really fun time there, but it was a kind of company that was reaped.

109
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:45,500
It was pivoting, you know, so it wasn't, there was a little bit of marketing at that, but they need to completely redo the positioning, The Branding, the message, They were shifting into a different market.

110
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:55,700
So that was an interesting, one against River, you know, my job was like to get them from that, you know, from The Old Company to a new identity, a new brand, new growth market.

111
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,500
So that was a journey there.

112
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:58,900
I did.

113
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:07,400
It start up called kentico, which was in the kind of monitoring space of quality was sort of in the devops space can take was sort of in the monitoring.

114
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:22,100
I did a couple of monitoring things, cantik was one where there was this huge analytics engine, Again, you know, new technology, sort of new approach to an old problem, kind of thing and again, very, very little existed there.

115
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,000
I was the first marketer in the door, you know, building.

116
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You know, it's like one of those things where you have got like five or seven arms, mostly basically contractors as agencies and doing all this stuff for you, you know, trying to build out a tech stack and then growing a staff from there.

117
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,400
From there.

118
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,300
I actually took a little bit of a sideways John into a later stage.

119
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,200
Build out as a head of product marketing company called thousand eyes, where they were kind of trying to get from that.

120
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:58,700
Let us say 30 40 to 100 journeys, and they needed to redo their go-to market around, you know what's the cross?

121
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,800
The chasm message, and the content of the thought leadership and building that all out.

122
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:11,000
So we built a big research, go to market research arm that really, you know, to engage market with the data we have and stuff like that.

123
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So what through an acquisition there?

124
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:30,600
To a little small tiny Australian startup called sineva that wanted to wear the founders were, you know, had built a really cool product and you know, focus on remote work actually, which is sort of the dotted line to how I got to first base because I started get interested in the space.

125
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,800
And that, you know, they had an outcome in mind which was they want to plug into larger tech companies.

126
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:50,200
So, the job there was a go to market and really grab some share, get some mind share your proof of the product, you know, build a pipeline and at join another company, which happens so Palo Alto.

127
00:15:50,200 --> 00:16:03,300
They were acquired by, we required by Palo Alto networks and then from there, you know, I did a stint at a company called pack of fabric which is like a newfangled Telco likes is totally automated Telco because I knew one of the co-founders there.

128
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,800
So again full stack, build them almost all these things.

129
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,000
It was a complete from the ground stack, build out, you know, and demand, gen nothing, no programs, no stack.

130
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,800
No nothing, right?

131
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Very little content and then kind of try to grow that.

132
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:46,200
And first base is sort of is an interesting case where you know as you know hinted by the title of this, the company had actually grown a lot through an incredible organic sort of social presence of the founder which I think is really fascinating to look at and learn from as I look at it and have an I came in again to kind of build the Systemic stuff of marketing, right?

133
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,500
From the ground up.

134
00:16:48,500 --> 00:17:09,700
So that's, I mean that those are kind of like my journey points, you know, in as fast as a nutshells, I could put him Incredible Journey and like, wow, major props and respect because there's probably a lot of Battle Scars and stories that you have for being able to Journey with so many companies.

135
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,300
So many different.

136
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:29,100
Founders, what are some of the like if Looking back at that Journey, you know if you were to pull out one or two nuggets of the things that really worked, when it when you're talking about like your stack, like this is the one, two, three Tech stacks that I always build.

137
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:39,700
And these are the layers of foundation that I always start with like, what works and then what didn't work maybe if you'd give us you know, a nugget of each of those, that would be great.

138
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,200
Sure.

139
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:57,300
I think the foundational Foundation to The stack is, is the message, you know, the message is the thing that drives, you know where you want to take your brand identity, its understanding, you know, getting to a really clear sense of what's our distinctive.

140
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,700
And what is it that?

141
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:04,100
We because I think it's sort of like marketing is about connecting, right?

142
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:24,600
And a B2B buyers, not just a Persona, they're a person and their that I think the foundation is empathic connection to the audience and to the problems, a B2B startup has a problem to solve and you have to often times.

143
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,600
If you're innovating, you have to unpack that problem for people.

144
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,400
Because if there hasn't been a solution probably, they have just suppress awareness of the problem.

145
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,100
It's there.

146
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,200
It might be very painful, but they haven't really impacted.

147
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:46,300
So if you can unpack that then that's the Foundational thing that allows your message and your mechanics to create a connection.

148
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:57,200
You know, people we want to be felt seen, you know, as a buyer I want to feel seen like you get what I am going through and you're speaking to my needs, right?

149
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
So that's the real foundation.

150
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,400
And then, you know, on top of that is then is I am just a huge believer that, you know.

151
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,700
Okay?

152
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:14,400
So text acts and stuff like that are all about your data, you know, Know your data is Destiny and marketing, right?

153
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:24,700
So like building a really clean hygienic sort of data set knowing what the value and relative like cost of that data is important, right?

154
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:36,700
Knowing whether or not you can find your audience, Sofia with, sufficiently targeted way because ultimately marketing is, you know, enables commercial things to happen, like in this, you know, opportunities and Pipeline and stuff like that.

155
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:53,500
Right is, is sort of like is always taking an Ouch what works for me is always making sure that the way I think about the data and how we identify our potential buyers is a strong fit sometimes that you can just get that out of off the shelf.

156
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,500
You know, whatever.

157
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:04,600
And sometimes you can't and some which case you have to be willing to go there and enrich and think about the metadata that will help you Target and connect to the right people.

158
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,100
You know.

159
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,800
So the because the rest of the stack is really, you know whether whatever choose your automation sweet.

160
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:23,700
You know, I have kind of been on a Marketo sort of Journey for a little while so that's kind of the way I tend to build but it's like that's your journey in terms of the stack Stacks can work for whatever your purpose is, right?

161
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:35,300
But it's really about making sure the data is a good fit so you can deliver that empathic connection and open people's minds to the possibility.

162
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,400
That their problem is something that can be solved.

163
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:52,100
And if you're the one who's communicating about it, effectively and connecting with them, then they're going to say, well I think I am going to give mentally speaking this brand, a chance to tell me how to solve it right the rest of the mechanics.

164
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,100
I mean, let us face it.

165
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,300
How many ways can you communicate?

166
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,000
With people, they haven't changed.

167
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,700
All right, you know, you have email, you have various platform, kind of things, you know, experiences like this.

168
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,100
Right in person things phone calls, right?

169
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:14,300
Let us just, you know, I mean, in B2B you're not sending a lot of text messages, you know, typically, right?

170
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:24,300
So like your mechanics are very similar that automation Stacks are commercial choices your data and how you curate that.

171
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,600
Data at the right cost and volume and, and targeted.

172
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Sort of is the key anyway, that was a long dissertation, but that's I think those are some of the key things I think for success in B2B marketing.

173
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,500
That's great.

174
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,200
And so, when you say data, if you could get a little tactical, are you talking about?

175
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,800
Just the key, insights and attributes on the buyer and their behavior.

176
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Like what kind of data points are you immediately setting up your Tech stack to Capture?

177
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,200
So I want to know the ICP from a sales point of view, right?

178
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:16,300
Whoo-hoo constitutes the best Prospect, you know, the partnership with sales is super important because the pipeline of service to sales is like you're doing marketing engagement, other engagement, you set meetings through SD or bdr teams Etc.

179
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,900
What's the ICP really mean?

180
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,400
What are the points of insight or qualification or Discovery, right?

181
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,500
That really matter those The thing is, I am going to draw drawn, and so I want to do a really good brainstorm there might be.

182
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,000
For example, if you have technical qualifiers, right?

183
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,900
They have to have these conditions in their environment.

184
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,900
Technically speaking to sell your product, they have to have theirs from a graphic size of company, all those sorts of thing.

185
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,000
What's the zone, right?

186
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,900
You want to be in.

187
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:51,400
There are, you know what title classes and B2B, oftentimes, you're dealing with title classes, and then there are sorts of like propensity to buy indicators their keywords.

188
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,900
You can find there are other things like that, right?

189
00:22:53,900 --> 00:23:04,700
So, and some of those things, again, are collected commercially by, you know, big databases companies, like, Zoom info or others, or whatever, and some of them are just not, and you just have to go and get it right.

190
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:23,900
There're different ways to do that, but part of it is also the calculation of targeting and going finding data to go after an audience that you have profiled as it were based on, you know, data that would indicate they could benefit from your solution and would be open to it.

191
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,300
Says the venue based right?

192
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:39,200
Like hey, if you go to conference, you have you are sort of targeting but you're also having a certain amount of Randomness right to like, people come with interest in all sorts of reasons to various venues.

193
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:54,100
So the balance of how much but you're going to pay a lot for certain kinds of datasets engaged more or less engaged datasets versus you might pay a lot less to discover although you have to go and engage it.

194
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:02,900
So that balance because marketing is economics to as like you have a finite amount of money to spend to reach the market, right?

195
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,100
I don't know.

196
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,000
That's at least some of how I think about it.

197
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:12,000
Any do not dues like, is there something clearly that you have learned through failure?

198
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,300
I don't really believe in content syndication.

199
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,100
Hmm.

200
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,200
And here's why because a lot of (Kit) because content in syndication, it's in of itself.

201
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,100
But I think now they're all sorts of places where people consuming things that you subscribe to this.

202
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,200
Whatever thing you know you go to the site over and over to consume stuff.

203
00:24:32,700 --> 00:25:02,800
How much brand awareness do you really have when you can when you consume a piece of interesting content from that site that you have been visiting over and over again very low right clutch often times the price you pay for that can be pretty high you know I mean because like the brand awareness and that the link to a solution, you know, is Important because often times when you're trying to communicate, it's just those little small degrees of awareness that makes someone more like this segment.

204
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,400
I am going to actually read this email or mmm.

205
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,800
I am gonna actually, you know, right?

206
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,100
You know, like consider a conversation.

207
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,300
It's we're dealing with in because so much of the buyer journey is hidden right today?

208
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:22,900
Much of the buyer journey is become more digital and more invisible for a variety of reasons.

209
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,800
Privacy reasons.

210
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,900
Also, Two things.

211
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:37,000
So, your brand awareness points and how much you are paying to get those, that mental awareness, and thought leadership awareness, that degree advances over time.

212
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,200
Many cases ways you don't see It's good.

213
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:41,800
Okay.

214
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,200
All right.

215
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,500
Due to time and this is this has been rich.

216
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,900
I hope folks can still stay beyond our 30 minute Mark here.

217
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,600
This is our first one, give us Grace on.

218
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,400
They're just such Rich content to be able to discuss here.

219
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,800
Let us jump into the LinkedIn.

220
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,600
Yeah, I beg, you know, I think this is like the burning question that we all have.

221
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:16,000
How did you guys get 100 paying customers Within In months of literally only Chris, herds LinkedIn profile.

222
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I mean, he's got, is it up to 60,000 followers?

223
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,400
Now?

224
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:28,900
So as long as 50 feet between 55 and 60, I think now and just to give some do, like he's also very active on Twitter and is about the same number of followers there.

225
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,700
So I think there's a combo effect, you know, there're different objects, audiences, that lurk different places.

226
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:43,100
And I think the, you know, the lessons I take away is that You know, he took what I was.

227
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:51,600
What I am going to say is a cultural thought leadership angle, he was not, flogging the service, right?

228
00:26:51,700 --> 00:27:07,400
He was speaking to a big felt need and I think that the thing that's the important lesson there is that your you have a corporate brand and a corporate brand, has a communicate at a business level of value, right?

229
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,300
Corporate Brands need to take business value, thought leadership.

230
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:27,100
But in Social, you're really dealing often times with a different level felt need, which is about the things that are driving those the needs and the felt sort of problems or the challenges in the environment, you know.

231
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:34,600
So I think one of the lessons from what I saw see you know that Chris has done is he really aimed at that higher level?

232
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,300
What I would say?

233
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,600
Cultural thought leadership.

234
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,200
Hmm.

235
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:44,100
Now in the remote work space, you know, pandemic the Of work, all that kind of stuff was a big ferment, right?

236
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:50,200
But there maybe you know it's but whatever the field you're in.

237
00:27:50,400 --> 00:28:05,600
I think that social impact really comes from taking that Higher Culture, maybe it's a tech culture angle, maybe it's in this case is about future of work and things like that is very broad, but I think the big lesson is that it can't be about you.

238
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,100
It has to be about what's having a big impact of what.

239
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:18,300
What is a point of view, you know, that adds value to people's lives or ORS, helps direct of way of thinking.

240
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,100
So, Chris has taken a very, very assertive.

241
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,400
Very assertive stance.

242
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:24,900
On.

243
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:39,800
A lot of things he's been willing to put his kind of ego online and say this is what's going to happen, you know, you won't be if you don't Embrace remote work, as a company, you're just going to be less competitive remote work.

244
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,900
Oriented companies are going to be the more successful.

245
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,900
This is akin to e-commerce.

246
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:54,400
He's taking he's making these sort of level of claims and that is a so that's a stance that Doesn't really have anything to persuade doing with first base.

247
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:08,000
And I think that's really important lesson, you know, that's really interesting, and he's very like he's willing to push the bar of his perspective and even get angry, you know.

248
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,500
And I think that's, you know, it's a, it's one of those things where, you know, that does get attention.

249
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:29,800
But it's because it's pushing a, it's pushing the bounds of comfort without being, you know, may be disrespectful but it's saying there're some places where you To push the bounds of comfortable thinking, right about things.

250
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And that's something that I think is very effective.

251
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:44,000
You know in Social especially if you're not coming from the angle and you know like would you like to buy one of these kind of a no angle?

252
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,600
That's huge.

253
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,700
I mean, it seemed like Chris.

254
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,200
He also was able to just own his profile like you didn't have to.

255
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,400
There wasn't a marketing leader that came along his side and was Like hey you need to build your profile.

256
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Like he took his own initiative right?

257
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,300
As a Founder.

258
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:17,300
Yeah, I mean I think that's conviction, you know, I think as a founder or someone who's going to lead out on that, you know, you have to have a certain amount of ego strength, you have to have, you know, willingness to go out and not be perfect.

259
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,200
And you have to have a leave with a lot of conviction.

260
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,700
What do you really have?

261
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,300
You know, super strong conviction about that.

262
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,800
That is speaks to the zone of the world or fly fulfill traffic America.

263
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,700
Sorry I got my little one that just entered into the room.

264
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:43,100
This is what happens, remote work, folks is you know, that level of conviction comes through, right?

265
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,200
And I think that speaks to where people are at and that see, that's connection, right?

266
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,300
That's, that's a real connection, you know, your brand corporate brand cannot do that at the same level, you know?

267
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,900
No, it's good.

268
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:08,200
So okay so just speaking tactically here, you know, strip strategy and tactics of like okay if I have a B2B SAS brand where I want to elevate my LinkedIn.

269
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,200
What if I don't have a Founder?

270
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:21,200
Like Chris heard that, you know, has that sort of even the energy the strategy to put into LinkedIn.

271
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:21,700
Yeah.

272
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:39,500
Could it be another figure Within The organization that takes that sort of cultural Transcendent stance where they're not getting into buy, buy, buy my product, but like they're really taking a stance culture like can it be or does it need a come from a founder of a company?

273
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,500
I think what recent what needs to be happened?

274
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,400
Is the founder.

275
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:43,800
You know?

276
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:52,000
And yes I mean I haven't previously worked for a company where the founders has had this much sort of social presence.

277
00:31:52,500 --> 00:32:01,700
But I have worked in a space where You know, and I have worked with more techie products and sometimes those just aren't as favorable to the level of like culture thought leadership.

278
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:13,600
But I think the thing is that someone has to have some conviction and courage to go push at things and say, we're going to take some stance on something that's relevant to what we do.

279
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,400
And in service of what people need in our environment.

280
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:27,700
And maybe you have data, you know, for example, maybe you have data that, that if you actually like positioned in it, Shushes others in the industry.

281
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,500
You have to be willing to do have some controversy.

282
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
I mean, a very nerdy sense.

283
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,800
I will give an example for when I was a thousand eyes.

284
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,000
One of the things I saw, when I got there was here, we have got this amazing.

285
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,200
We have got this data about what's happening in these various Cloud applications and stuff, and one of the things realize there's a lot of Business Leaders.

286
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:50,000
It leaders are like, when something goes wrong with slack or whatever, it's like, nobody knows really why it's happening.

287
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,200
Because of course, if your slack, you're trying to fix that, but you're not going to say like are out all that like It's not your focus to go.

288
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,600
Analyze, what's happening like from an outside in perspective, so it's sort of like we had this data.

289
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:14,800
So like, let us go put it out there, you know, and that probably was and I fact I know that was uncomfortable for some applications and Cloud providers and such and, you know, we put our reports and stuff like that.

290
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:24,600
But are found when our co-founders had the conviction, this was the right thing to do because there was so much lack of understanding, you know.

291
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:51,600
So we went And I just built a program to kind of push that out there in a responsive way and that got a lot of coverage and attention and all that sort of thing and became some that we could stand on to say we're all about providing intelligence and visibility even though in some ways it might be uncomfortable to call out like hey yeah you know this part was the internet but this part might have been the provider sorry but it's just what we see, you know, it's very helpful.

292
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,500
It was very helpful.

293
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:58,000
People Express a lot of appreciation for but Others expressed that it was uncomfortable for them.

294
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:05,400
Our co-founder had the conviction that this was worth doing, and we're pushing hard at that you know.

295
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:19,300
So there's you know is there something like that you can contribute to the dialogue to the value of people's lives that will push the boundaries of the push of comfort a little bit to get at what's real.

296
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:28,100
So good about let that simmer with all of us because there's something really powerful about that.

297
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Thought, right there.

298
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,500
All right, we have got some questions coming in.

299
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:43,699
Let us pull up and questioned on to stage and if you don't mind answering this, what is the most effective LinkedIn marketing tactic you have used at first base?

300
00:34:44,800 --> 00:35:03,100
From know, I tend to believe that especially as a, if you're a startup, that's not very well-known yet.

301
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:13,900
And, and let us remember that every startup is not very well-known as much as you think like, well, you know, people already know as they don't write, even when you think they really know you, most people don't.

302
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,900
So, I think awareness you know it's like it's the you know the truism awareness that comes in before demand.

303
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,300
That one thing I really like from S cost point of view is doing per company.

304
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:35,100
Targeted awareness ads you know because creating and going Beyond just your narrow buyer.

305
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,900
You know going a little broader.

306
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:44,400
I really like that because I think that, you know, it creates brand awareness and it creates if you're proposing sort of problem.

307
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,800
That's You solved it creates an again awareness like oh this is something that we could solve again much of the time.

308
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,200
When doing something new, you have to sell the problem right before you ever get to sell the solution.

309
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:03,500
So I really like that as, you know, as a way and I have seen in other cases that it works from Prospect point of view.

310
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:12,200
It also really works in a pipeline point of view, you know, there's a lot of people when someone is considering a purchase that need to start becoming wearing of a brand to, you know.

311
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,000
So I really like that.

312
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,700
That's incredibly helpful.

313
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,900
We have got another question here from Justin.

314
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,300
How do you bridge the gap?

315
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,100
Between cultural messaging and corporate messaging.

316
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,100
Such a good question.

317
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,600
So I think you have to let them have breathing room between them, right?

318
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:40,000
Let your cultural message be it and then the then you're just doing breadcrumbs, basically, right?

319
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,600
You know, because your corporate messaging should also be value, added thought leadership.

320
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:55,100
In much, you know, you know, like how to, you know, in a sense you're trying to answer, how to solve a problem that you have that you might not be fully aware of, but we're going to help you understand, right?

321
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,900
That's the cultural thought leadership, the corporate thought leadership is business value thought leadership.

322
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:07,600
In both cases, there will be a lighter breadcrumb Trail to Brand hey you know, like from a cultural point of view, by the way.

323
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,800
This is what, you know, this is why we, you know, we do.

324
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,000
I start first base or this is my first base exists.

325
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,700
That's really you want to go.

326
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:25,200
I, in my opinion you want to A little more, just brand awareness kind of thing, corporate value, sort of business value, thought, leadership your bread crumbing from the solution topic 2.

327
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,200
Here's you know, and here's what, you know, this is what we solve, right?

328
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,700
Your cell, your kind of explaining the world of the problem and all that kind of stuff.

329
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,400
And then, you know, this is what we solve.

330
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,800
So they're your bread Crumb from both of them because people don't want to be like assaulted with a pitch.

331
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,800
They want to be, they want to gain knowledge and insight.

332
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:53,800
And all thought leadership, you have to do that primarily and then you breadcrumb down to if you want to know more, how to solve this, you know, dot here, you know.

333
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,100
So that's my thought about that.

334
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:12,000
I almost see like an Illustrated buyers Journey, kind of map that likes as you were like saying dotted line to Brand, everything has dotted line to brand, but these are like the levels of messaging that really good thought leadership piece, Alex.

335
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,100
Yeah, hopeful thought leadership dots to brand and Corporate value thought leadership dots to Solution.

336
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
That's my mother's whines.

337
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,200
That's good.

338
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,900
All right.

339
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,200
And we have got a question from Sal here.

340
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,400
What are the most effective SEO practices optimizing a marketing campaigns online?

341
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,100
Content?

342
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,800
SEO is all about content now, period, right?

343
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,400
I mean it's that's just the way it's going.

344
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,300
It's less and less about technical games.

345
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:52,800
There are things you can do to Ruin yourself, technically, just by being bad at constructing websites and stuff like that, but mostly that part's pretty straightforward.

346
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:03,000
Now, the most effective SEO practice is to is fundamentally to invest in Awareness targeting, their simple tools to do this, right?

347
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,300
You know, the SEO sort of analysis tools, there's a number of those.

348
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:12,600
And then, and really to do sound, SEO content analysis, fundamentally.

349
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,500
There is a way to write and this is It is a tricky way of it's not easy.

350
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:33,800
You have to make enough domain knowledge and writing flexibility to do this, but you have to Target things to rank and that is a competitive environment keyword environment, but you also have to have it has value.

351
00:39:34,600 --> 00:40:04,300
That's, you know, say you target then you get a Content analysis and then you have to be really good at writing in between that's How you will you know, that's how you win in my opinion and SEO is, is content optimization in a way, that doesn't lose value to the reader from a, you know, kind of like readability and, you know, I mean, consume ability point of view, I can't just be a pile of weird keywords, you know.

352
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,300
But you do have to pay attention to that.

353
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,400
There's a technical angle to SEO writing.

354
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:17,900
That's something I have learned through a lot of, experimentation over a number of companies, and investment in tools and agencies and all that kind of stuff.

355
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:31,300
So that's what, what are your key Tech stack tools that you go to, for SEO and even across the board across other channels, like what CRM?

356
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,600
You know, I mean, social tool, if you have anything like what's your go-to?

357
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:45,900
Well usually I mean You know, I like I said, sort of, I have been kind of building Marketo Salesforce tax for a while.

358
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,900
I mean, that's what's happened.

359
00:40:47,900 --> 00:41:07,300
I like to have in the flexibility in terms of the programmability, from automation, but without getting into true programming there and I, there are a few, there are a few tools that when one of them got deprecated, that, I mean, II think you should invest in a tool.

360
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,200
I think now.

361
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:20,000
If I am not mistaken, there might be what for drift that is a routing tool routing is really important intelligent routing and response to email.

362
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:29,800
Because like, I mean, these are like the fine details of like you send out an email, someone responds to it, who does it get routed to write an owner and sgr?

363
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,500
Someone else.

364
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,000
Whatever.

365
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,500
If there's an auto response, where does that come from?

366
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,500
If there's an auto response, where does that come from?

367
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,300
Right.

368
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,900
If you're sending from an alias, like you don't, you don't want all those things get messed up.

369
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,100
So like there's some nice routing tools.

370
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:45,500
I think that you that are really smart to invest in, you know.

371
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,300
I think there's gosh, you know, the thing too is like tools.

372
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,300
I think there's gosh, you know, the thing too is like tools.

373
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,800
Keep on like getting Consolidated.

374
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,800
Keep on like getting Consolidated.

375
00:41:52,800 --> 00:42:04,700
There was a tool that I really love that detected out of offices and, you know, noted other potential contacts, but I think that you two got bottles or something like that.

376
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,300
I think it called lead, no more Spike that, but I am not sure if they're independent anymore.

377
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:22,300
They're like the little oftentimes, like there's the big tools, and then there's a little, you know, sort of that nuanced things that you if that just prevents you from having to do a lots and lots of manual labor from SEO point of view.

378
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,700
I mean you can choose your semrush or other or sort of analytics tools.

379
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,300
I mean there's a number of those and in fact if you want Fidelity, get two of them.

380
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:40,200
You know and compare because they will have slightly different angles and you know and Gosh.

381
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:48,600
There's a really nice content optimization tool that I am blanking out on right now.

382
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,800
It's I am having a brain fade moment.

383
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,400
I know there's Jasper.

384
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,200
AI is something.

385
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,200
We have been looking into as far as content generation with AI.

386
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:08,300
Yeah, that's been interesting and then I am curious about like, like headlines to like is there a tool we use that co-head code, analyzer headline tool.

387
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,400
Do you guys use anything like that?

388
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:26,800
I mean, for topic subject lines, you know, at this stage not yet, I mean I like some of those tools I think the Part you know part of a lot of what I also get focused on.

389
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:41,700
It's just the technical enablement tools to check the biggest one of the biggest dangers is just like managing your Center reputation and like you know, your ability to get through today.

390
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:53,100
So you know, a combination of your MX toolbox and you know, some other things like that, that will analyze for like how will, you know, how will system see it?

391
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:08,700
You know, I think that's those are you know, kind of your sender reputation and your ability to actually get messages through deliverability and all that is one of the biggest obstacles that we have to overcome now as marketers, right?

392
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:19,100
So I think those, there's the class of tools that deal with that is something to just make sure that you have in your toolbox like don't neglect that, you know.

393
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,100
That's great.

394
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:32,400
Wow, there's so much like Rich information here and it looks like we have answered the questions in queue an Alex.

395
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:41,800
Is there any last word of encouragement or advice that you would give to the broader B2B marketing community?

396
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:51,700
I mean in a start-up scenario I think just remember that.

397
00:44:52,900 --> 00:45:18,800
It's not uncommon that technical Founders for technical Founders in particular Market is the least understood discipline and always be an educator, you know keep hold onto your conviction, you know and you know you're going to have to devote a certain The energy to just be explaining and educating as to the why, why want to do things this way?

398
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,100
Why, why don't do things that way right?

399
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:33,100
You know things you know will work because that knowledge isn't necessarily something you can assume and most Founders want to learn but you just can't leave that Gap.

400
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:42,600
So I think but in an environment like and especially these days, you know, with all the turn, all the things happening, it could be easy to be discouraged, and two questions.

401
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:47,100
Some of your convictions especially this B2B as I said, you don't have massive amounts of data.

402
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:55,300
You, you're doing some things based on best practice and unobserved best practice and things like that, right, you know.

403
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,700
So just hold on to that and be encouraged like that.

404
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:08,200
That's has a lot of value and to lean into being, an educator and Communicator internally as much as externally is super important.

405
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:26,400
And then, you know, and I think that level of conviction and willingness To say like this is, this is the way to go and here's why and here's you know why we want to stick with this is its just super helpful, I think just for you know, kind of like almost like emotional health as a start-up and B2B marketer, right?

406
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:33,900
Like to not get so buffeted by all the, you know, things that demands and all that in the pressures.

407
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:44,500
But also just knowing that you have to You know, educate a lot so that you don't become misunderstood and what you're trying to deliver in the challenges of it.

408
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,000
Right?

409
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,200
Expectations and all that.

410
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,700
That's my big encouragement of one big, big lesson over time.

411
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:50,900
Is that?

412
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,800
Yeah, Market is just not well understood in B2B often times.

413
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,400
And so, part of our job is to be that, you know, educator internally.

414
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,800
And as we do it reinforces our convictions, right?

415
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,000
Helps us believe in what we're doing and like to follow that path.

416
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,900
We You know, obviously follow the data and all that kind of stuff too.

417
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,100
But I don't know.

418
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:19,300
That's that would be my encouragement is don't lean away from that like lean towards that and it's super helpful.

419
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,000
It's encouraging for yourself, right?

420
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,700
To believe in yourself in that way.

421
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,300
And it's helpful for others.

422
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,800
So you know, that would be my encouragement.

423
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,100

All right.

37
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, you know before we jump in, I don't know if you know Madison you noticed, but we had in our intro video a runner, he was a French Runner who is chasing that van really fun video there.

38
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,200
And your Runner is As well.

39
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
In fact, I heard you.

40
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,300
Do you have a half-marathon that you're running?

41
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,500
I do this Sunday will be my first half-marathon.

42
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,000
So I want to know, say I am a full Runner but I have gotten into running and it's been fun.

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,200
So half-marathon this weekend.

44
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,800
I am going on PTO soon.

45
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,700
So I have no complaints right now.

46
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,800
Excited for some first across off The Bucket List.

47
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,500
Nice.

48
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,400
And how long is a half-marathon 13.1 miles?

49
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,600
Wow, that's still Seems poof like quite a journey.

50
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:39,100
Yes, when I actually put it into perspective of like walking a mile versus running a mile and how many 13 is I regretted it.

51
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,300
But I had already signed up so couldn't turn back at that point.

52
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,300
Good for you, I look forward to hearing how that goes.

53
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:55,800
The other thing that I know about you is you're a movie buff and you know, trivia like no other.

So we actually have a fun poll that we're going to get on stage right?

55
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,100

Okay.

64
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,700

00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,700
What is the answer?

66
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,500
It is as the majority voted West Side Story.

67
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,400

68
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,700
Who?

69
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,200
Yes, Jordan.

70
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,400
I see in the chat, you mentioned.

71
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,000
LOL.

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,400
And one for about 5 seconds.

73
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,800
LOL.

74
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,600
And at the 2017 Oscars was announced as the winner.

75
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,400
Hold back.

76
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,800
And it was actually moonlight.

77
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,800
So that's honorable mention will give it as Jordan called out.

78
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:15,800
Nice.

79
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,700
Wow.

80
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,400
Okay.

81
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,800
Well that is some good stuff.

82
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:32,600
I know who to go to next time, you know if I am up there and money's on the line for a movie trivia Madison, I am giving you a call, I will be your phone a friend.

83
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,400
Thank you.

84
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:42,000
All right, well, we'd love to hear more about your journey and your story getting into demand generation.

85
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,800
Loom, can you walk me through you and I had a little dialogue?

86
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,300
Our to this and walk me through.

87
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,500
Like, when you just, you started your journey just getting into B2B marketing.

88
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,400
How do you re?

89
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,000
So I actually started in the fintech world as an account manager.

90
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,900
So really customer success focused and I started at Bloomberg and it was a great experience.

91
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:20,600
It was so amazing to be able to work at a big company that had clients all around the world, not only the us, and what I learned from that, Experience was I love to speaking with the customers was a B2B side of it.

92
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,200
So you know, how are people using your product?

93
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,700
What is it solving for?

94
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,400
How do you think of it?

95
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Internally verse how your customers are using?

96
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,000
It can be so different or it can have unique use cases that you never had thought of.

97
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,100
So I really loved working with customers and I had the opportunity to travel across the u.s.

98
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,900
And meet with them in their offices.

99
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:46,100
So back in the day, when people were traveling like crazy, I was always on the plane, I am racking up.

100
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,600
As Delta SkyMiles to meet with people and just like, how are you using Bloomberg?

101
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
What problems are you facing?

102
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,000
Not only that Bloomberg is solving for but like that's top of mind.

103
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,400
Like what are you worried about?

104
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,200
What's, what are you thinking through?

105
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:05,900
And then trying to figure out how as a complete partner, not just a vendor or a software, can we work to solve those?

106
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:14,700
So that's kind of where I started was more on the account management side and then I realized fintech Financial Services was great, but maybe not.

107
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,300
But kept me up at night and Was riveting to me.

108
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:26,100
So I moved into the more Tech space and I have tried to keep more marketing roles since then and more like marketing B2B SAS still, as kind of like through and through.

109
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:40,600
But started in a very different world compared to where I am today, I would say, wow, okay, so roots are really with the customer in stripping them, as an account manager, and getting the ins and outs there.

110
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,900
So then from Bloomberg, where did you go next and face?

111
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,700
So from Bloomberg, I knew I wanted to get into a more marketing rule but also a little bit more, like the more Tech space I wanted to try out.

112
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:03,200
So I moved still to a SAS B2B company but called Bounce X, which then up branded to wunderkind and I moved into a sales role.

113
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,800
So kind of instead of the post sale what about the pre-sale motion?

114
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,600
And I worked in both like a bdr and account executive fashion.

115
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,700
So very top of the funnel.

116
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,700
How are you understanding the market landscape?

117
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:26,800
And you're proud of your solution and how do you, how do you solve for the problem at hand and actually trying to gain that interest from people and start at the top of the funnel from a sales perspective.

118
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:35,200
So did that for about a year when I got to try to break through the noise of like, hey, this is how Wonder can help your company.

119
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:45,300
Worked with some great e-commerce Brands learned so much about the pre-sale cycle and what that looks like from initial conversations up until signing a contract and formalizing a partnership.

120
00:10:45,600 --> 00:11:00,600
But Realized once again I loved the customer and the prospect conversations but the selling aspect and that AE role wasn't necessarily what I found a lot of passion, so I made a pivot internally at one Dirk into their customer marketing team.

121
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:11,800
So really looking at customer advocacy and how do you do that through referral programs customer advisory boards events partner with our events, team case study is.

122
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,400
So how are you taking that customer voice and bring it to all the different channels which I just Fell in love with marketing from there?

123
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:25,400
So that's kind of the transition from Bloomberg to wunderkind and then from sales to my first quote, unquote, marketing title.

124
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,400
Wow.

125
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,200
And then from one organ.

126
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,500
Did you go to loo right after that?

127
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,400
Yeah, so from one Jerkins, one of my really good friends.

128
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,200
And also co-workers Kate, we work together at wunderkind.

129
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,900
She leads our Event Channel and it's just an absolute rock star.

130
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,800
And she was joining Loom, and she was like, hey, they are starting a strategic marketing.

131
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,900
And you would be a great fit.

132
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,700
You should apply and Kate and I have worked together and I adore her.

133
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,300
So I was like, sure.

134
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,000
I will take the call, we will see what it is.

135
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,200
And I fell in love with looms Mission.

136
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,400
I fell in love with the team from both the marketing and sales team at Loom, I was leadership was great.

137
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,300
That it was kind of great opportunity.

138
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:19,900
To not only further my career with a new industry and a new product, but also start strategic marketing from the ground up at a hyper growth startup, which I just Couldn't pass up the opportunity from every aspect, that's awesome.

139
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,000
And your collective experience working pretty much across the entire Prospect to customer Journey.

140
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,200
Gave you the experience and tools needed to really be successful.

141
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,800
So like coming in Tulum.

142
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,400
What were some of the key problems that you were solving for?

143
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:44,800
And, you know, then we can go into some of the revenue marketing questions that we have, and how you guys are solving for Revenue marketing.

144
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,200
But yeah, what were some of The initial problems.

145
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
And how did you go about tackling them?

146
00:12:49,900 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah, I think when I was looking at joining Loom and when this role was created, it was leading the Strategic marketing team was, which was going to be a net new function within Loom.

147
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:09,800
So it was also building it from the ground up and not necessarily a lot of problems, but a lot of opportunities that Loom was looking into finally like breaking into and growing out.

148
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,800
So, when you're looking at the Strategic marketing World from looms lens, we kind of break it up into new busy.

149
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Account-based marketing.

150
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,600
So how do you do, like, one too few and one-to-one campaigns to generate Pipeline?

151
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:30,800
And then from the customer marketing perspective, how can you have close alignment with your customer success team for renewals upsells expansion opportunities?

152
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,900
How do you create that customer advocacy?

153
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:45,800
So it was a really big, like, Boulder project of what does strategic marketing look like at Loom and getting to work with marketing, folks and colleagues and also sales and customer success to understand.

154
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,700
What does the moon look like today?

155
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:58,900
From a customer's perspective in the Enterprise world and how do we want to up level that and take it to a Next Level compared to necessarily like these are the gaps we're like hey these are the opportunities they're endless.

156
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
Where do we want to start?

157
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
And what's most impactful to start?

158
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,400
Oh, that's so good and interesting.

159
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,400
So then I have a question just going into your initial like even targeting.

160
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:17,900
You know, you said that you guys focused more on like an ABM type of strategy versus a one Many strategies or let us ?

161
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,800
Do you do both?

162
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,600
Like, is it more so a spear fishing game versus a Netflix?

163
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,400
So I think it depends on the channel of marketing you're looking at.

164
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:45,900
So when I was joining, I joined in the Strategic marketing role I and now head up, our demand generation team, so it kind of oversees both you have your one too many tactics but you also have your one, too, few in your one-to-one and it kind of depends on what is your goal outcome.

165
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:57,200
Um, so Loom is a product LED Growth Company, which means anyone who's listening right now, can go on lulu.com, sign up for free, try out the product, learn to use it, and then we also have an Enterprise offering.

166
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:05,900
So, if your org is looking at bringing on loom as a partner for asynchronous work in collaboration, that's the kind of side that the demand gen team focuses on.

167
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:15,900
So we do one too many campaigns like content, launches and webinars and conferences to get the loom name and brand out there and educate people on the shift to a sink.

168
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:31,600
Is work, but we also do some really high level one too few and 121 channels like executive dinners or an account-based marketing like campaign from a gifting perspective, so we get I think demand generation and my current role.

169
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,700
I love it because it's a really good balance of both.

170
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,800
Just depending on like who the audience is at hand.

171
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,500
Mmm, that's good.

172
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:46,600
And you know, one of the things I think is constantly keeping that pulse on the data that you're getting, you know, Across.

173
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,500
What are some of the key metrics that you're constantly?

174
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,400
Just keeping top of mine.

175
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,500
And you know, how are you measuring that and having those conversations with sales and customer success?

176
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:11,400
Yeah, I think we're looking at like the who were targeting, there's a couple of things but like, keeping the customers, keeping the customer Centric, which of course, is the topic of this.

177
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,300
But like who, what is the end goal of like, their current knowledge?

178
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:26,500
So we're in a great spot where we have a free and a business product, and we still want to continue to get people just using loom and on the mission of transforming, the way people work.

179
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:36,600
So when you're looking at that group of people, you really want to make sure you're nurturing them from like a thought, leadership, activation and usage, adoption perspective.

180
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:45,900
But then, when you look at what you'd consider, like your ideal customer profile for the Enterprise skew, which is where our demand generation is really focused on driving that.

181
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,600
Ripa sales from our sales lad and our prize offering perspective, you're looking at who is the right fit for us?

182
00:16:52,700 --> 00:17:03,600
Do are these topics like distributed work, hybrid work, top of mind for them and like making sure that your value prop is aligning with their business needs.

183
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,200
And that's kind of like what you're keeping a pulse.

184
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:15,900
I was like who's talking about async work, who's talking about looking on collaborating through different time zones and like that's the data you want to make sure you're staying on.

185
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,700
Above because it makes you a partner compared to just a line item, vendor or solution.

186
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,900
That's great.

187
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:33,100
There's actually a question that just popped in and I actually think it aligns very well to what her talking about here.

188
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:41,300
So I am going to pull it on stage, oops, sorry, Katie.

189
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,200
Katie is my producer.

190
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,800
They're all right.

191
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:53,300
So how do you prioritize your budget and resources between campaigns for your free product versus your Enterprise offering?

192
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,000
Great question.

193
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:05,600
Yeah and I will say if anyone has a full correct answer to this like let me know because this is how we're approaching it but there are so many different ways from Marketing perspective.

194
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:15,200
I am really fortunate to have great marketing Partners within looms marketing, departments such as like products marketing, growth marketing, our brand Team and then our comms team.

195
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:22,400
So, when you're looking across the different marketing channels, we all have different like key Focus areas while we're all leading up to the same goal.

196
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,200
So something like our product marketing team.

197
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:33,700
There's a few people on that team who are really focused on like creating products for a marketing products, like the free offering and our growth marketing.

198
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,500
Team is really focused on just sign up.

199
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,800
So across our free business, they're really focused on that, like, self-serve side.

200
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,400
When we're looking at like demand gen, so my team specifically, our number one, focus is going to be that Enterprise offering.

201
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:56,100
So majority of our budget and our time and our resources will go for our Enterprise offering with in helping our counterparts, that growth marketing who's focused on signups.

202
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,900
Because I always feel like you hear this flywheel of, like, you start.

203
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
Someone as a sign up.

204
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,200
They begin to use Loom.

205
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,500
They might switch companies.

206
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:03,800
Then they.

207
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,500
Common Enterprise client possibly, then you can in front of them.

208
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
So you're having that whole life cycle.

209
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:22,500
So our team focuses on our budgets and resources for the Enterprise offering and then different marketing functions and teams within Loom, like our product and growth team will focus more on like a sign ups for our freedom business.

210
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,100
So that's kind of how we break it up based off of teams and priorities.

211
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,200
Gotcha.

212
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:41,000
And, and okay, so here's another question because you mentioned a growth team and you guys are working on, demand, generation mainly, Jean Enterprises you mentioned, but I see sometimes growth getting intermixed with demand gen.

213
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:55,600
Yeah, how do you define, you know, even just from Madison's perspective, like, how are you defining the differentiation between demand generation and growth and how they work with the right teams to?

214
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,000
Yeah.

215
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,800
Comes so our head of growth marketing, Nick Lafferty is a phenomenal human being that.

216
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,200
I am so blessed to work with as well.

217
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,400
And when Looking at kind of like his world in my world.

218
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,900
Nick works with our product and growth team as well.

219
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,700
So they're focused on signups.

220
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:21,200
So how do we get more free and work signups and then my world is then when they're ready to graduate to our Enterprise offering, how do we engage those people?

221
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:29,600
So I couldn't necessarily do my job without their team focusing on signups and where you have that intersect is something like ads.

222
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:55,100
So if you're trying to run some ads on LinkedIn, that growth team would typically maybe take a lead on but there's a really specific Target list that we want to get in front of from an Enterprise offering how can Nick and I work together to launch at ad campaign both for a wider audience but also for a specific account list to get in front of them or when it's looking at launching new ads, and he really wants to integrate the customer voice.

223
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,000
How does he work with customer marketing?

224
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,700
Which is under my team to like, get those customer voices in those case studies to launch from an SEO or an ad perspective.

225
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,100
The way we Define it as they're really focus on those like free and business offerings.

226
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,100
And we're focused on graduating those to an Enterprise offering.

227
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,900
But there's so many cross-sectional areas in campaigns.

228
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,500
We both get to work on together which I think just makes the entire Loom message and voice.

229
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,100
One holistic company, compared to siloed, teams working for different goals.

230
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,300
That's good.

231
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,800
Wow.

232
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Okay, so going back to holistic.

233
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,600
This is where I think the term Revenue.

234
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Getting comes into play.

235
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,500
And how do you define revenue marketing?

236
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,800
They're seeing different things out there.

237
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:49,500
I have to, I have always seen different definitions and I think it's really interesting the way I have historically, like viewed.

238
00:21:49,500 --> 00:22:03,700
It is like, how are you using marketing tactics or campaigns events or programs to drive pipeline opportunity for whether that's however your business is set up?

239
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:10,500
How are you driving like marketing campaigns and efforts to drive pipeline or realized Revenue as a company?

240
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,000
And I think that looks different depending on every company structure.

241
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:23,500
But from looms perspective, we're looking at the revenue from demand General Revenue marketing, like really close alignment with your marketing and sales team to generate that.

242
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:32,200
So, I think Revenue marketing to me has a closer alignment with sales, then some other types of marketing at different companies.

243
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,200
Gotcha and describe that relationship with sales.

244
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,000
I know this is also another big topic that often, but how is it for you?

245
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,700
What's your philosophy on that partnership?

246
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,600
And you know what does that interaction look like for you on a daily on a weekly monthly basis?

247
00:22:50,300 --> 00:23:02,100
Yeah, I historically and even now say I think the thing I love about demand generation, strategic marketing is you get to work, so cross-functional across different companies.

248
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,100
I think I have always gravitated towards a customer marketing, strategic, marketing, or demand generation Rule.

249
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:17,900
And I think, when you're looking at the partnership between sales and marketing, the biggest thing for me is making sure that you have one unified goal across both teams.

250
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,500
So, like, how can you create a goal?

251
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:32,400
If it's pipeline, if it's close one Revenue, if it's signups that both teams are incentivized to work together or there's at least a flow of, if marketing hits their goals, it clearly translates.

252
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,900
Stu, how sales can then achieve their goals and I think that has been huge for me.

253
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:46,800
And at Loom, one of the reasons I came to loom, is the sales leaders and the sales team I was working with were just phenomenal, Advocates of marketing, and vice versa.

254
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:56,500
So I work with our sales team, they're probably some of my biggest stakeholders is making sure that we're helping them hit their closed, one Target.

255
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:07,900
And when we're launching campaigns from a one-to-many went too few one-to-one, we have their support, and we're Speaking, that's a message of we're going after the same targets, we're having a unified message.

256
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:15,700
My success is directly linked to your success and like, making sure that is like, in lockstep has been great.

257
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:21,600
But I think I talked to sometimes our sales and say yes to more than my actual like marketing counterparts at times.

258
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Wow.

259
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,900
So that the frequency is quite often.

260
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,800
And is it like a daily interaction on check-in?

261
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,200
You know each other's metrics and holding each other accountable?

262
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,600
We do.

263
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,200
So at Loom we have like a revenue leadership.

264
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,500
So from the go-to-market side of our business, we do weekly check-ins from a sales leadership and Market leadership.

265
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,800
I try to also meet with the leaders one-on-one every week, every other week, just to make sure we're in alignment.

266
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:56,200
And then on top of that, I think, like, throughout the day, there's plenty of things or ideas or hey, can you jump in this team meeting to explain this new campaign that's going live.

267
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,300
Our hey, we're thinking about investing into this conference or this ABM campaign.

268
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,300
Do you have some time to chat?

269
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,200
Through it.

270
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,100
So we're all in the same shared slack channel.

271
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,900
So we see what each other are posting.

272
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:16,000
We have sync time, check-ins, and then selfish plug is like, I use Luma lot to be like, hey this, these are my thoughts of the team's planner.

273
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,800
Hey, this is a campaign, I am going to run.

274
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,100
Can I get your eyes on and I send it over, and they send thoughts back?

275
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:31,200
So I would be shocked if there's a day I go without talking to anyone from sales, but we do have formal check-ins as much as just informal check-ins as well.

276
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,300
That's great.

277
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,000
And I love how you all are using your product asynchronously we use Loom.

278
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,300
Similarly, so we're making it.

279
00:25:40,600 --> 00:26:00,200
Yeah, it just helps when you, I think the thing with sales and marketing is you're just running a million miles a minute like very other teams and departments and personas as well, but, you know if someone's on a live call and that's the only time I am between a call, it's just hard to always, like, a line schedules with, like, calendar Tetris so looms.

280
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,100
When a great way to be like, hey, here's a campaign idea.

281
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,700
Let me, We have a second or like the salesman cake, here are some feedback of what's worked in our sales process.

282
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,200
Like feel free to take a look when you have some time, and then we can mold that into each other's work as well.

283
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,500
That's great.

284
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:24,700
So, as far as the key stakeholders across the company that you're in touch with regularly, are you in touch with the head of sales, the head of growth marketing, the head of customer success.

285
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,800
Like are those the key folks that you're working with Anna?

286
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,200
Yeah.

287
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,400
Even a weekly basis.

288
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,200
I would break it up kind of into like the Different departments.

289
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:50,200
So from the marketing perspective, Laura hard our VP of marketing very closely with her and the other marketing leaders which span across a growth marketing, our brand, our products, marketing, and our columns because we want to make sure that the message we're saying is Unified across all of our marketing channels.

290
00:26:50,200 --> 00:27:03,600
So meeting with them frequently weekly as well, and then from a sales perspective, looking at our head of customer success, our head of sales, but also the managers for our AES, the managers for our Those Dev teams as well.

291
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,600
And then, I think another benefit that I get to work closely with is our products team.

292
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,500
So when you're looking at something like your site and web forms, how can you experiment with our product?

293
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,700
How do we build Enterprise features and offering?

294
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,100
So then you also have the product team that I work closely with.

295
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,600
And then very fortunate that we have great exec team here at Loom.

296
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
So getting to work with them.

297
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,400
I like what's resonating with people different areas we want to test into marketing how they view.

298
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,800
Our Relations.

299
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,600
And then also using them to get it from the customer.

300
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:44,900
So how can we create more executive relationships and like, full Partnerships from a thought, leadership, a Solutions, a networking opportunities as well?

301
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,500
So looking at like a full partnership with people and bringing our execs into that as well, so good.

302
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,200
Okay, cool.

303
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,500
That's really helpful.

304
00:27:52,800 --> 00:28:25,700
If anyone has questions, feel free to drop them in QA Madison, I would love to move into the conversation that you and I had Before this time when we were talking about just the inundation of crowded in boxes and how, you know, we're in a funky time right now, with the recession with tech layoffs, taking place, you know, you see a lot of folks, missing forecasts especially this quarter, yet Revenue numbers are still higher than last year.

305
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:41,900
So it's kind of like this like a really funky time and so you know from a B2B marketing standpoint Fires and Prospects are inundated with emails, in particular, seems to be like that's like one of the go twos.

306
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,800
But I mean, I hundreds of emails a day and it's like, ah, you know, noise there.

307
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,400
You're now LinkedIn, massive Channel.

308
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,200
Like there're other channels, Facebook Tip, Top stuff.

309
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,700
You know what's working for you?

310
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,500
What, what, what's like some tea?

311
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:07,400
I don't know if you figured out your Bullet to get in front of, get through the noise, what's working?

312
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,300
What's not working?

313
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:17,900
You know, I think that's, I mean, I definitely feel it from both sides from like the consumer of getting lots of emails, then from the marketer trying to break through the noise.

314
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:32,500
And I think the thing we try to keep in mind, is every person consumes information differently, and I think you go back like elementary school and then you get learn to you get taught to learn different ways like Hands-On verse reading.

315
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,800
Denver's video.

316
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,100
And I think what we try to keep in mind is like, how can we continue to diversify our channels or hit multiple channels?

317
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:49,200
So you know, some people might still prefer email, but then we have to do that channel incredibly well because it is so crowded.

318
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,600
And then there might be another person whose like, hey you know what, something that's kind of hard to do.

319
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,100
Because we're distributed now, but like Direct Mail.

320
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,600
I am a huge fan of gifting and direct mail.

321
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,100
I think you break through the noise that way.

322
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:06,900
And I know personally, like, I check our Box every day I do, I am not expecting anything, but I love a letter, I love a package.

323
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,700
Like I will always look that way.

324
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,600
So how do you take what's under your marketing or sales per view?

325
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,900
And like, make sure you're hitting people through different channels at a respectable Cadence.

326
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,900
So how can you partner in email touch point?

327
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,900
And then maybe three to five days later.

328
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,700
Try a LinkedIn touch point and then see who's engaging from there.

329
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,500
Okay, both of those were myths.

330
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,300
Okay, let us try to introduce a direct mail piece or hey, email the Age, but they didn't click through?

331
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,600
How can we take email a step further?

332
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:46,600
You know, maybe we add a layer of personalization with like a specific landing page or an image, like really just evaluating everything on an ongoing basis.

333
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:54,300
So, you're partnering LinkedIn with in-person events with direct mail with gifting and then still doing email.

334
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:02,500
So I think for us it's just like how many channels can we use and continue to like keep a pulse on the learning.

335
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,400
So that if something is working, we can catch it.

336
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,300
If something's not working, we can pivot.

337
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,600
I think that's the name of the game is, like pivoting quickly, while still realizing like some things will work.

338
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,400
Let us test them.

339
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,700
Some things will test, and they won't work, and that's okay.

340
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,300
You learned.

341
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,500
Mmm, that's good.

342
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:24,400
And you mentioned the pulse not going back to your customer experience passion.

343
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,500
You know, you got to be tight with your customer.

344
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,800
You gotta know.

345
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,300
So how do you all do that?

346
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,100
Like, how do you keep that pulse?

347
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,500
Because it could get very, you know, how it is.

348
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,700
There's so many channels so many things to manage in marketing.

349
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,400
How do you keep your pulse?

350
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,500
Really close with your customer?

351
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,400
Yeah, I think that's whereas much as you can.

352
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:53,400
You create a holistic relationship with a customer compared to a transactional relationship.

353
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,900
Now, not everyone wants that at Time Square.

354
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,800
Like, hey, I need a solution and that's fine in.

355
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,500
Those can still be your strongest Advocates but are there ways?

356
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,900
As you can row, a relationship with the customer.

357
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,200
Are they hiring for their team?

358
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,300
Can you share that job posting with someone?

359
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:16,100
You might think it's good fit, your personal Network are they having issues with like figuring out how to onboard in a remote World?

360
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:28,500
Okay, can we share how we do that at Loom and how we have approached it is they looking to you know maybe they want to get into content more, do we have a case study, we could feature them in or do we have a blog post?

361
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,600
We could have them post and I think we have a phenomenal customer success team.

362
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:47,100
Here that is able to build those personal relationships and then when you take it, that next level is like, okay, how do we up level that to be a more thoughtful, istic partner than just that transactional like, hey here's our service.

363
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,500
You use our service, I will talk to you at renewals, which RCS?

364
00:32:50,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Tune does not do their phenomenal but sometimes you have to go that white glove service, a little bit above and beyond compared to other times, which takes more work, takes a little bit more creativity, but your point in turn.

365
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:08,500
Having your pulse on your customers and getting to use their voices tenfold every single time.

366
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,500
Mmm.

367
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:09,800
Okay.

368
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
That's interesting.

369
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,900
So, do you find yourself, aligning prioritizing, even a lot of strategy towards that custom Mark marketing angle.

370
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:28,400
Like, like when you have the prioritize across that Journey, where do you see is like really strategically important to focus on?

371
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,400
I think it depends on your company goals, as well.

372
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,800
Like We're how mature are you from a sales outside of the business, and I am.

373
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:37,800
Sorry.

374
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:47,800
There are some construction going on, if anyone can hear that but well at my previous role at wunderkind where I was specifically full-time in customer marketing.

375
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That was we were more mature company in terms of like our customer base.

376
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,100
We had so many Brands we had to show them love to.

377
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,200
So our primary focus was we had one clear buyer.

378
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,500
So how do we work with that fire to be like they're complete partner?

379
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:12,100
Through all things that they might worry about when you're looking at Loom, and we're still growing, our sales inside the business and our Enterprise offering you have to balance it with.

380
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:18,500
How do you get new customers versus how do you continue to love and nurture your existing customers?

381
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,100
But we will throw is like the same love.

382
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,600
You'd give to your existing customers.

383
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,800
You have to apply to your prospects because they could be that customer.

384
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:34,000
And the moment you start interacting with them from that first touch point with loom, that's going to set the stage for the Our customer lifecycle.

385
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,699
So how do you make sure from that first patch Point?

386
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:50,699
You're still giving them that white glove service or that flower that solution, that then will nurture them and continue to grow, through the sales cycle, through closing through becoming a customer and then the lifetime of renewals and expansions and partnership opportunities.

387
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,900
That's key it.

388
00:34:52,900 --> 00:35:04,000
And would you say like that's something I know you're passionate about is being able to align that thread line experience across Ross, all those touch points.

389
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,300
I mean, how challenging is that, though?

390
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
You know what I am saying?

391
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,300
Like, why?

392
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,600
I mean, you're looking at bandwidth to like in a world that's distributed at you can't get in person anymore.

393
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,800
You can always travel.

394
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,700
So I think it's like an ongoing question of, like, what is the right way to do it?

395
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,500
What's the most effective way to do it?

396
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:30,000
I think from My Lens it's just like being very thoughtful in your brand and how you want that to come across?

397
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,600
And that's where we work really closely with like Brand Team, visually our content team from the content we're putting out.

398
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,500
And like, how do you from the beginning?

399
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:50,200
Make sure that like, your brand voice is consistent through a webinar or piece of content or a one-pager follow-up, and that you become more of just, instead of just like a name, you're like, oh Loom.

400
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,900
I understand like they're, they have that logo.

401
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,100
They have like this, you at work messaging.

402
00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:00,700
They have those reduced meetings, the meetings canceled candle, like how do you become more of a moment?

403
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:15,000
No movement, then just Unnecessary, like, oh, I think I heard of loom weights, and that, then we will have that credibility, that will bring you throughout the entire life cycle, whether it's high level or 121 touch points.

404
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
That's great.

405
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:31,900
I am going to ask a more tactical question when it comes to Journey mapping and you know, just beginning to ideate shape and strategically identify the areas that you want to focus on.

406
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,800
Is there like a team?

407
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,700
Like do you guys work as a team to build out journey maps of your existing prospects?

408
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,900
And is that how you get alignment?

409
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:51,600
So that everybody is pretty streamlined or what's an Activity or thing that you guys do to be able to map that out.

410
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:05,200
I think when it comes to our Enterprise offering and working closely with our sales teams like our sales Dev leader and r8u leaders and just the head of sales as we do talk to you through.

411
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,700
Like okay, who are we targeting?

412
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,300
What's that account?

413
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,400
What does that Persona?

414
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,400
What is that customer profile, that's a right fit and then what is the message?

415
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Messaging that lands with them and then who's going to own that?

416
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,000
So what is that formal process of like, hey marketing will own these efforts.

417
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,400
This is where we will need support from the sales Dev team sales devil on these efforts.

418
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,100
Okay, we have alignment there now, what's the handoff process look?

419
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,200
Like, how involved is marketing from an open Ops perspective?

420
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,100
What's that Cadence?

421
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,600
Like, it's really mapping out.

422
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,400
How do we need this journey to look, internally from what we think and then who's going to own what?

423
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,000
And how does that all speak together?

424
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,800
And then when you're looking from a Smurf success perspective.

425
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,900
It's kind of similar.

426
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,700
It's okay.

427
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,900
What are the biggest?

428
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,500
What are the biggest issues?

429
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,700
Our customers are facing.

430
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,000
Do we not have, you know, executive relationships that are strong enough?

431
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,900
Do we have questions regarding use, cases and adoption?

432
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,300
Okay.

433
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:09,500
So what does that Journey look like with our head of onboarding Brittany and then our head of Cs like, what does that Journey look like from signing a contract to Renewal?

434
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,200
And what points do we need?

435
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,000
Touch points?

436
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,400
And that, how did marketing support that how will onboarding on that?

437
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,200
How will see s on that?

438
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:25,600
So it's really just like when you're looking at the life cycle, understanding who's going to own what and with what channels and then keeping those touch points on.

439
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,200
So be like, hey guys, this is where we're at with this.

440
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,700
Where are you at with that and keeping those lines of communication open?

441
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,500
That's really good.

442
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,300
Thank you for breaking that down.

443
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,800
I think that's helpful to hear.

444
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,700
I often think time like everyone does it a little bit differently, you know, hearing how you all aligned to it.

445
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,800
Far as creating objectives and like accountability.

446
00:38:49,800 --> 00:39:04,500
That way, is it also done in a similar fashion where you're aligning with each team head and determining where the priorities are for the business need and then coming up with objectives together.

447
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,500
Yeah, I would say it's a little bit of both.

448
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,100
So it's looking if you're looking at the revenue side of it.

449
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
So the go-to-market side, it's like, you know what?

450
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:18,900
Our goals for closed, one Revenue This quarter and, you know, how do we want to Pace towards a company?

451
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,700
Okay, so this is how much we need to close.

452
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,500
How much pipeline do you need to generate?

453
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,400
Because an ideal world, every deal you open closes to pipeline, but we obviously know things.

454
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:27,800
Come up.

455
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,900
Timing isn't perfect.

456
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,700
So you know what is our goal for closed?

457
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:38,200
One Revenue as a company, then how do we need pipeline generated and what does that pipeline ownership look like?

458
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:44,500
So, you know, looking at your typical like pipeline generating functions like a sales development team or a marketing team.

459
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,200
And this case Duration breaking those out into ownerships.

460
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,600
So then what we do is when we have our pipeline Target or our opportunity Target, you know, I bring that back to my team, and we say, OK, this is our goals.

461
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,000
How do we think we can hit this?

462
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,500
What campaigned, what events, what content can we create?

463
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:08,100
Launch and run that will help us get to those goals and then you bring that back to your cross-functional partners and say this is our cue for plan.

464
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,400
This is the calendar we're proposing.

465
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,300
Does this work in alignment with your guys's goals as well?

466
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,200
You know, can we get the brand support?

467
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,400
We For this the product marketing support the cam support.

468
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:28,100
And, you know if sales comes back with a very different calendar, okay, now, we know ahead of time, we have to both reset and like, figure out what that makes up was, but really just coming together.

469
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,200
Collectively then going to the experts in each area and saying, how do we hit this?

470
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:37,700
Then coming back together and be like, is everyone aligned on this calendar, to start great.

471
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,500
Let us run with it.

472
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,600
And then you those weekly check-ins really helped be like, hey, we're under pacing.

473
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
We're over pacing.

474
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:53,500
We need to Pivot But as much as is much pre understanding of like, this is what our goal is as an entire sales on motion.

475
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,600
Here's a the demand gen team thinks we can do in terms of achieving it.

476
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,900
And how does that align with it?

477
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:05,400
You guys are thinking or are there any red flags that either team needs to call out or get support on for this to work?

478
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,100
So that's a whole like pre-planning process and Alignment before you go into execution.

479
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,300
Exactly.

480
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:21,700
Because I think the worst thing you can do is silo that off to, okay, I have this pipeline goal.

481
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:37,400
I think this is what we will hit it, and I am just going to run in my race and do what I am doing without other input because, you know, you could be missing something huge, the alignment could be a little bit off, or if you don't have that cross functional support or understanding.

482
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:43,000
Like, you could be running all of these efforts which are great but then the follow-up falls through.

483
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:59,000
So I really make sure before Or anything is executed, you guys that you have buy-in and you have an understanding of the impact in why I think translates into a program success in smooth execution before you're even like Off to the Races.

484
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,600
That's good.

485
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,100
Wow.

486
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,500
Okay.

487
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,200
Rich.

488
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Insights that.

489
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:15,300
If it is anybody has any questions feel free to drop them otherwise we can move into you know, we here.

490
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:36,400
We're trying to create an environment where we can encourage one another as well, because B2B marketing is tough right now, you know, I mean, you called out like the market trends the cluttered in boxes, like now more than ever to you have so many other obstacles and new barriers of prejudice, but we used to have.

491
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,600
So, I mean, it's yeah, it's a tough world.

492
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,300
It is.

493
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,400
So with that Madison, do you have any words of encouragement?

494
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,900
It or advice to us.

495
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,400
It could be a tactical point of encouragement or general.

496
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,300
Feel free to share that.

497
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:08,300
Yeah, I think my professor and one of my mentors once said, it's when you're looking at like an obstacle or climbing a mountain, you know, you take it one step at a time and you can't do it alone.

498
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:18,900
And I have been incredibly fortunate to have so many great mentors and even just co-workers and friends who have I am willing to share insights and advice and thoughts exactly.

499
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,300
Like we're doing right now.

500
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:30,600
But like thing, my biggest piece of advice is just give that back if someone asks a question, if someone raises their hand, if someone wants to network, take that coffee chat.

501
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:41,900
Promote thought leadership, as much as like, each company has their own goal will make it a better community and will become smarter more efficient marketers if we're all willing to like work together.

502
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:48,900
So I think for myself it's like you take it step by step, so you Each challenge by each Challenge and take it for face value.

503
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,400
Do the best.

504
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,900
You can learn how to Pivot quickly but also be grateful for what you have learned in those moments.

505
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,900
And then you can't do it alone.

506
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:03,300
So, you know, reach out a helping hand because there will be a time when you will need help too.

507
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:14,800
So, just continue to give back and network and be willing to promote thought leadership, whether you think it's thought leadership or not, I guarantee you someone will find it useful or helpful.

508
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:23,000
So I am always wanted to be like a try to give it back as much as you can, because it means that much, and then they do it tenfold as well hoof.

509
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,900
Powerful, those are powerful words.

510
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:31,300
Madison, thank you so much for taking the time to share your wisdom.

And you're tuning in from where today?

21
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,400
I am from Seattle awesome.

22
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:43,800
And what's the weather like It's sunny, but deceivingly cold, and it's about 40 degrees, so Seattle will get you that way.

23
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,600
Yeah, absolutely.

24
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,100
But we will take it over the rain.

25
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,300
Okay, nice.

26
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,900
Nice, great.

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,600
Well, before we kick off into this really great breakdown of your story that we have got here outlined.

28
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,400
We wanted to play a quick little game to get to know you a little bit.

29
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,800
It's called two truths and a lie.

30
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,000
And basically, there are going to be three facts.

31
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,900
So let us go ahead and get that on stage.

32
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a quick poll, okay?

33
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,800
So of these two of them are the truth and one will be a lie.

34
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:30,200
So Mattea could you break down these troops and what of one of these?

35
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,700
It's a lie and folks, feel free to vote wherever you think the LIE is.

36
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,300
So what are these fun facts about?

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,600
My brothers, are the fifth generation of twins in my family.

38
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,600
I was a D1 athlete and my favorite food is hamburgers.

39
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,500
All right, go ahead and drop your votes.

40
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,700
Like D1 athlete?

41
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,400
Hmm.

42
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,300
And twit fifth generation of twins.

43
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,300
That's like, I don't know.

44
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,300
Hamburgers.

45
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,300
I love hamburgers.

46
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,700
Hmm.

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,800
All right.

48
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,900
Okay, so votes are in All right, Mattea, reveal of these?

49
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,000
Which one is the LIE?

50
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,600
My favorite food is not hamburgers.

51
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,300
I have been a vegetarian my entire life, so definitely out of the question.

52
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,900
But someone put in the chat and no cheese, I love cheese, so I am not vegan, but yeah, I was a D1 athlete.

53
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:45,300
I played tennis University of Dayton and my brothers are the fifth generation of twins in my family.

54
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,600
It actually didn't skip a generation either, so pretty crazy.

55
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,700
Wow, that is crazy.

56
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,100
And how long do you were a D1 athlete?

57
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,000
We're at again.

58
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
University of Dayton in Ohio.

59
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,600
Wow.

60
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,900
Very cool.

61
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Tennis head-to-head.

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:14,400
I don't think got, I think, you'd totally slam me in that and I would not want to make very cool.

63
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:22,600
Well Mattea, tell us a little bit about your journey getting into partner management.

64
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,200
And, you know, I would love to hear a little bit of your story getting into Tech as well.

65
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,600
Well.

66
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,700
Yeah, definitely.

67
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:40,900
So I majored in entrepreneurship and Supply Chain management when I was at Dayton and then I went directly into a sales role.

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,400
After college, my dad has been in sales pretty much his entire career.

69
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:56,100
So, followed in his footsteps and I worked at AWS started in their sales internship program and then into a full-time role.

70
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:28,900
So, had a couple years there where I was helping on the inbound sales team and then on the outbound sales team and then I transitioned into an account manager role, Amazon's on the other side, not on the cloud services anymore, where I was working with our vendors in Latin America for Amazon Explorer, which is a virtual travel experience, and it happened to launch kind of right around covid, even though it wasn't really a covid play.

71
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,300
Say, and so I was in that role for a bit working with folks in Latin America that were providing those travel experiences which is wow.

72
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,400
Okay, so describe that a little bit.

73
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,900
Because we're yeah, we're in the events world as well.

74
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:55,300
So you all were providing virtual experiences like what kind of experiences Yeah, so, in Buried.

75
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:04,000
So you can have a shopping experience if you wanted to go to local shops in Argentina, and they would send you a pair of earrings.

76
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You could have that or you could have one of my vendors in.

77
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:20,600
My favorite experience was visiting a rescue ranch in Costa Rica where you got to see like toucans loss of all these animals up close.

78
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,500
So I was yeah, it was pretty cool.

79
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,000
Well, unfortunately, they're they have shut down.

80
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,200
I think a couple weeks ago but yeah, the time being it was yeah various thought.

81
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,500
They tried something out.

82
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,100
Yeah.

83
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,900
And you said yeah, an experience to we did after.

84
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:54,800
So after you mention that Katie and I were just like, so curious about this, we went on AWS, we're like whoa, they actually do offer these virtual experiences there was like a tour in Israel and a Sorry and all these things.

85
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:03,200
So we signed up for one just to try it out and it was an amazing, just whole rundown with this with the Safari.

86
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Dude, that walked us through different animals that he brought up to the camera.

87
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,500
There were like these exotic animals, it was really fun.

88
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:20,100
So very cool experiment by AWS and you know, unfortunate that it had to get shut down.

89
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:30,900
But so you were reading that and were you managing and identifying and getting all of the different vendors and partners that would be part of this program.

90
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,600
Yeah, so it was an interesting time because it happened all around covid.

91
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:45,400
A lot of travel companies were starting to go out of business or looking for ways to make up that Revenue that they weren't getting within person travel.

92
00:09:45,400 --> 00:10:06,100
And so it was a very, I would say easy way for us to get involved with them in the beginning, because they wanted to diversify how they were making revenue and oh, well, we can off, we can solve our tour guides, you can pay them, they can offer these experiences like they would Good in person and have them on Amazon.

93
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,000
So, Gotcha.

94
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,600
Wow.

95
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,100
So interesting was that hard to identify them or like, how would you go about demon find?

96
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,400
Yeah, somebody that gives you a tour and Israel, or how do you find?

97
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,700
Yeah.

98
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:30,600
Most of them were major tour companies and then a lot of them have individual hosts, that do the experience.

99
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,800
And so we started with a bigger ones, and then scaled down to smaller tour companies as well.

100
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,900
Because some were just not built for the virtual experience environment.

101
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:52,600
Like getting them, they had to get a phone, download our app and go through training with our team and everything and it was somewhere just not built for that.

102
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,400
So It was a Rancher.

103
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,900
All right.

104
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,300
Okay.

105
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:04,800
So then fast-forward you're working with AWS managing these incredible epic experiences and then.

106
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,300
And then what Yeah, and then I joined type Forum, which is where I am now as a partner manager.

107
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:22,200
And I kind of wanted to switch out of a sales role and go more into business development Partnerships because I think that's kind of the way of the future of selling.

108
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:36,400
And luckily I have had a really good team of mentors to coach me through the process of Partnerships and kind of get me up to speed because I was coming from a sales back.

109
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,800
Round, but a lot of (Mike) my skills were really transferable, I think.

110
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,800
How long have you been with typeform?

111
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,300
In this.

112
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,500
Just over a year now.

113
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,100
Yeah, yes.

114
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,500
Okay, so break it down a little bit because Partnerships, you know, there're Partnerships and marketing, there're Partnerships and product.

115
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
There's so many different types of Partnerships.

116
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,200
How do you define it with the role that you're in at tight form?

117
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,200
Yeah, that's a good question.

118
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,900
I think Partnerships could sit under sales.

119
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,600
They can send or Business Development.

120
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,800
They can sit under product depending on the type of partnership.

121
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,100
We're under business development, but we work with all of those cross-functional teams.

122
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,300
So we have, I would say two major types of Partnerships out type form.

123
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,700
We have our Tech integration Partners.

124
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:33,300
So, for example, HubSpot you can build a type form and then push your responses in top spot.

125
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,400
Or we have our referral Partners.

126
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,300
So marketing agencies that we work with that refer typeform to their clients.

127
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,900
Those are our two main partner types.

128
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,600
We have you know affiliate style like a few others.

129
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,700
But those are our main focus.

130
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,100
Gotcha.

131
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,600
Okay.

132
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,900
And then, where is your main focus?

133
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
It's a great, it's a great question.

134
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:06,200
I would say, mainly on our marketing agency referral Partners, it's who I work most closely with gotcha.

135
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,500
Okay, so can you walk us through what, what's a day in the life?

136
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,000
Like are you identifying agencies talking to them?

137
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,500
And then ultimately what does a win-win look like?

138
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:30,300
Yeah, definitely, so most of our partners right now come in organically, they love type warm, and they want to be a partner.

139
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:42,900
So they apply on our landing page, we get them review the application, put them into our partner relationship management tool which is partner stack, and then we will work with them and have like an onboarding call work.

140
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,800
With them to get up to speed and different enablement material certified.

141
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,900
And then from there, that's when they're referring clients.

142
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,700
It's to type form, and then we're sharing leads to them because they will go up on our directory.

143
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:08,500
And so for example, if someone needs help with their typeform, they can go on our directory and find a certified partner to work with and get that started on their own.

144
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,100
Gotcha.

145
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:18,300
So, when, when you're trying to get a win-win going, what does, what does that look like for you?

146
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,400
And also for the partner?

147
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:35,900
Yeah, definitely I think the most important thing about Partnerships and if you don't take anything else away from this entire conversation is that it has to be mutually beneficial and it has to be a win-win for both us and for the partner, otherwise, it's not going to be successful.

148
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:44,400
And so, you know, kind of what we look for in a good partner is having a shared ideal customer profile or ICP.

149
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:53,300
If we don't have that it's not going to be successful and then also an overlap in our Text, a core ecosystem is also really helpful.

150
00:14:53,300 --> 00:15:10,700
So if we have an agency, that is also certified in HubSpot, for example, and type form, then were continually growing that customer base, and it's kind of win-win for all types of Partners and that's the ideal situation.

151
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,400
Gotcha.

152
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,000
Okay, that, that's interesting.

153
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:29,800
And at a given time, are you meeting to manage like X number of relationships, you know, and how do you do that well, especially remotely and, or do you go in person and meet with some of these Partners sometimes?

154
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,900
Or, I mean, how, how do you all keep the relationship?

155
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,900
Good.

156
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Yeah, I think it's a tricky question and something that everyone's figuring out in the remote environment.

157
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,200
I have actually been I think over 90% of my time.

158
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,800
Working has been remote and building relationships.

159
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,500
Pretty much through a little square on the screen.

160
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:05,900
So I think the biggest thing for us is Obviously developing a personal relationship and figuring out little things that you can take away from a call with someone really listening.

161
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:17,500
You know maybe it's something personal to not related to the deal or what you're working on but you can pull that into the next conversation and just show that you're a human being and you care about them.

162
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:41,500
But also automating our program where possible and so obviously, for getting a lot of inbound interest into our program, we still want our partners to feel You know, like they have this personal connection, but we can use tools like type form where it feels like a more genuine connection and video, ask is our other tool and so, it's a synchronous video.

163
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,100
And we have right now.

164
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,900
We have a welcome video to all of our partners and it's basically me on the screen, so they don't just get an email.

165
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,800
Hey, what's up?

166
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,200
They get me on the screen and it's talking them through the program, what to expect and it's just definitely a more personal way to do it.

167
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:10,000
And so, if you can find But always to do that for Automation and it helps you scale the program because obviously, we can't have a one-to-one relationship with every single partner that we have.

168
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,300
There're certain ones that will get that, and then certain ones, that it will be more automated that makes sense.

169
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:18,900
Wow, that's interesting.

170
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:36,200
So you have got this process dialed in, and we touched that a little bit about your process in starting the Bishop all the way through to nurturing it and then continuing to maintain the win-wins and the checkpoints along the way to know.

171
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,700
Okay, this is a good partner to keep, or this is probably a partner that we should probably part ways with.

172
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,800
So, could you just walk through that process?

173
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:55,300
Like, you know, once the request comes through, then you started to touch like the video intro do, does everybody get that?

174
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,400
Like, just walk us through that, that experience.

175
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,500
Yeah, so first is figuring out.

176
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Is this going to be a beneficial relationship for both parties because you can have a pretty simple process there?

177
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,700
If it's not just walk away, no hard feelings.

178
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,800
But if it is then we would kind of go through.

179
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,200
They would join our program, they get the video, Welcome, everyone does get that.

180
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:29,400
And then we have time set with me and my colleagues so that they can put a face to the name of who's messaging them when I have questions.

181
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,700
And stuff like that.

182
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:42,500
But I would say as far as the process goes for ass off identifying if it's a win-win second is building off of our current ecosystem, kind of smarter not harder approach.

183
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:57,300
So you know, we have our Tech partners, and we want to make sure that we're utilizing them and creating a better relationship and that's how we get a lot of our agencies and then Third.

184
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:05,300
It would be building the personal relationship where we can identify which partner is really fit under our ideal partner profile.

185
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:16,700
Because there are some that we get that apply that might not be exactly what we think is going to be the best, but they will still get in our program, they will get all the resources and information that they need.

186
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,700
And then the ones that we think will be really successful will develop that personal relationship with kind of that give to get mentality.

187
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:36,900
And then really creating an open line of communication, so making sure that they get product updates, and they are in the know of what's going on.

188
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,500
And they feel like they're really an extension of our team, pretty much as how we want them to feel.

189
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,100
And then I would say the last piece of that is continuously asking for feedback.

190
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:54,200
So we can improve the program and implementing changes where Hospital.

191
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,200
Gotcha, thank you so much for breaking that down, A-Z, that could be your white paper.

192
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,000
You just turn on Partner management.

193
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,400
This from Matea Matias, key Magical elements that make partnership successful remotely.

194
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,100
Yeah, so that's interesting.

195
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:26,100
Now, as far as the agencies that come through, are they already customers a type form or are they folks are just interested in Snoring?

196
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,300
It's a mixed bag.

197
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:37,300
I would say, probably 60% of them actually, probably 80% of them, at least have a free plan with us.

198
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,900
So they were familiar with type form.

199
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,200
And that's how they found us.

200
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:46,000
They love the product, and they really want to be a partner, which is awesome for us.

201
00:20:46,000 --> 00:21:03,100
And it's a really easy way to start that relationship when you don't have to explain you know the solution that your product solves But then the ones that don't, they're usually from us reaching out, so they might have hurt.

202
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,000
Usually they have heard of type form, but they might not use the tool yet.

203
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,800
Gotcha.

204
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,500
Okay.

205
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,100
So do you guys take both?

206
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:24,600
Like almost like an AVM approach in identifying, certain accounts that you want to partner with along with, you have got sort of that product lead, growth motion of folks, just coming.

207
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,500
To you asking to be partners.

208
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,000
So is it a mix of both?

209
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:36,700
Yeah, I would say for a long time, it's just been in Bound which has been a great way to grow the program.

210
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,000
Just because we have that organic interest, and we have a pretty small and mighty team over here.

211
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,900
So it's nice to have, you know, that organic growth coming in.

212
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:55,100
But now we're starting to be a little bit more strategic on the types of partners that we want to add as well as what's organically coming in.

213
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,500
And for typeform, like what would that?

214
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,500
What's your ideal partner?

215
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:18,500
Yeah, so for our referral partner, it's pretty much a digital marketing agency or digital experience agency and a lot of times they already use our ecosystem Partners.

216
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:25,700
So HubSpot slack MailChimp, they are very well versed in that Tech stack.

217
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,700
And yeah, I would say mostly that inbound marketing.

218
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,500
They do branding design.

219
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
Web design.

220
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,100
That's pretty much our ideal partner profile.

221
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,000
And they're mostly agencies.

222
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,300
They're not necessarily.

223
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,400
Yeah, they're always okay, gotcha, very interesting.

224
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,800
Wow.

225
00:22:49,800 --> 00:23:03,900
Okay so quick question here on like key outcomes of success so when you're looking your in a journey with the partner and you're like oh this is like exactly what we want to see happen.

226
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,000
What does that look like for you all?

227
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:37,200
Yeah, I think the key the major key outcome is sustainable growth for us and for them like if they're growing their client base because now they offer type form or refer type form to their clients and their certified in it, and they know how to use it, and they know the ins and outs, and they can be a champion for us and that grows their client base while also growing our client base, because we're getting more lie.

228
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,800
Needs more clients that are interested in type form because they work with that agency.

229
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:51,800
And also they are getting more leads from us to by being honored being on our directory being a certified partner.

230
00:23:51,900 --> 00:24:02,200
I think it's comes back to the win-win, and we look for just that sustainable growth instead of just oh, they referred one big client, which is great.

231
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:08,600
But we want to see like, repeatable, motions, and beautiful clients.

232
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,700
That's good.

233
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,600
And you mentioned earlier an ecosystem.

234
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,300
Partners.

235
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,400
And you were saying, like, MailChimp and HubSpot.

236
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:22,200
All these others is that a different type of partnership, relationship versus the agency relationships that you have like, went what is it?

237
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,900
How do you define your ecosystem partners?

238
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:33,300
Yeah, I think ecosystem is kind of buzz word thrown around in insides for now.

239
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:38,700
But basically, our ecosystem, I think it includes are all of our partner type.

240
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:44,800
So if you think of it like a circle type forms in the middle, for our Circle, not for everyone else's.

241
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,500
But we have, you know, HubSpot MailChimp on there, and then we have our marketing agencies on there.

242
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,800
We have our Affiliates on there, so that's that kind of encompasses the entire ecosystem.

243
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:02,900
And then when I think of our Tech stack or figure Partners like that, HubSpot MailChimp, etc.

244
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,500
Those are our integration Partners.

245
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:16,800
So the partnership is much different because they're not exact, it's more about because we integrate with HubSpot.

246
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:25,300
A lot of their clients want to use type form or vice versa because they're using type form, and they see, oh, I can actually add this into my CRM.

247
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,200
That's awesome.

248
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,900
And so it kind of goes both ways like that.

249
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:37,200
Instead of a direct referral model, it's more of like an influence model that makes sense.

250
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,500
Gotcha.

251
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,800
Yeah, that makes sense.

252
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,500
Wow, that's interesting.

253
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:50,000
So your team needs to strategically be aligned on all the different types of partners that you all are managing.

254
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,500
What is that even look like for your team's alignment?

255
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,900
You know you got different folks that are managing different types of Partnerships.

256
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,000
Do you guys all aligned on goals together and meet on a weekly stand up?

257
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,600
Like how does that work remotely?

258
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,200
Yeah definitely.

259
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:15,200
I would say We're really lucky because we're all on the same team even though we manage different types of Partnerships.

260
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,400
So we work really closely together and there's, we're a pretty lean team.

261
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:30,500
So we're in touch at least obviously once a week when we go over when or what everyone's working on and what people should know about.

262
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:42,400
But we're also trying to go forward work a lot more closely together because for example, if we have a new product features, Launch with one of those Tech Partners.

263
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:49,100
How do we get an agency involved as maybe as a spotlight story, for example?

264
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:58,000
And so there's a lot more that can be done with using the different partner types and making a bigger Splash per se on that.

265
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,400
Very nice.

266
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,300
Alright, if anybody has questions for Mattea, feel free to drop them in Q&A.

267
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:28,500
Otherwise, you know, I think for those that are interested in getting into partnership like how where do you start I think that you can come from a lot of different backgrounds because the skill set is transferable.

268
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:53,700
Obviously sales is a pretty natural fit, but say if you worked in product before you'd be a great fit for our product level Partnerships because a lot more of that is more technical base or if you're like a customer success manager, for example, you could switch into Partnerships because you're working with a customer To deliver on an outcome together.

269
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,800
And that's really similar to partnership.

270
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,900
So I don't think it's, I think it's similar, but different.

271
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,900
And if you can apply your skills, I mean, we're all of us are learning every day.

272
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:10,000
And, so I have been lucky to learn from my co-workers a lot that have had more experience in Partnerships.

273
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:18,700
But if you can just bring your transferable skills and interpersonal skills, I think a lot of different people could go into Partnerships.

274
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,700
That's great.

275
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:31,600
Yeah, so basically like if you're if you have got a background in, go to market or even in product management, it could be a really good get path.

276
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:41,100
If you're interested in getting into Partnerships, all right, we have a question that is popped on what was your best partnership and why?

277
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,200
That's a good question.

278
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,700
I would say.

279
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:59,200
I don't want to say exactly who are what it is, because I don't want other ones of our partners to be sad or offended.

280
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:20,600
But I would say, the reason why it's great, and one of our best is because there's an open line of communication and the relationship, I mean Partnerships take time and so developing that if you have an open line of communication and you're sharing, when's, you're sharing things that are working things that aren't working.

281
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,600
Being and you're constantly changing and developing off of that.

282
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,800
There's a lot of partners that aren't as open with the communication.

283
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,300
I think that's the biggest thing.

284
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,500
Hmm.

285
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,700
Gotcha.

286
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:34,900
Yeah.

287
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,300
Maintaining.

288
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,800
That Communications both ways.

289
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,400
It's not just yeah, on your side.

290
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,200
It's also on their side as well.

291
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Yeah, it looks like we have another question from Brielle.

292
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,100
What are the main types of Partnerships?

293
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:59,900
If you had to categorize at a high level, and do you take a different strategy for each inbound versus outbound?

294
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,200
That's a good question.

295
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:11,700
I think the main types of Partnerships depend on the company and where you're at and your stage of growth.

296
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:18,600
But overall, I would say Tech partners are or product Partnerships or integration Partners.

297
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:31,700
That's all pretty much synonymous for the same thing and then referral Partnerships and affiliate Partnerships or kind of the main three and four.

298
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,000
Taking a different strategy for each.

299
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,400
I would say that again, depends on where you are in your stage of growth.

300
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:51,100
So for us in the beginning of starting our program, we realize that a lot of our customers using type form where agencies and so that was a perfect way to get started and bringing them in as partners.

301
00:30:51,400 --> 00:31:01,800
Whereas now that we have grown a lot more we can identify what is our, you know, best partner type look like and how do we get more of those and it becomes more of an outbound?

302
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,100
Sound strategy but in the beginning, it was more inbound.

303
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:14,700
So I think it depends on where you're at in the journey and it's hard to know what your ideal partner type is until you get started.

304
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:23,600
You can say, you know, do research and say, I think it's going to be this type of company and get really specific and then you start working with those types of companies.

305
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,600
You don't you realize it's not ideal.

306
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,900
So then you have to Pivot and go to a different partner time.

307
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,700
So I think casting a wide net.

308
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:39,700
When you're first starting out is probably the best way to do it and then over time realizing what is the best partner type and focusing in on that?

309
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,900
And going more of an outbound strategy.

310
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:45,900
That's great.

311
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,200
All right.

312
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,000
Angela's got a question.

313
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,700
How do you manage Outreach to new potential partners and then how do you prioritize who to approach?

314
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,400
Yeah.

315
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:09,800
So I think that being methodical with your Outreach is the most important, instead of, you know, kind of doing a mass blast on LinkedIn.

316
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,700
Like, I think we have all received those messages and you realize it wasn't just meant for you.

317
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,100
So I think focusing in, on obviously understanding who their target audiences and making sure that's the same as yours.

318
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,600
Because then, you can say, I really do think this is going to be a positive.

319
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,400
Relationship.

320
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,500
And we're going to grow, because we have the same types of customer.

321
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:51,200
And so, you will get more of your time working with us, and we will get more working with you and prioritizing who to approach is kind of, if you are able to see customer overlap, like in tools like crossbeam and reveal, those are ways to prioritize, kind of whom to work with.

322
00:32:51,200 --> 00:33:03,000
You can see how much overlap you have, but if you don't have that, You kind of just have to do trial and error and see what works best and who's the most responsive?

323
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:08,900
And what types of partners are providing the best relationship?

324
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,300
That's great.

325
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:21,100
So you mentioned crossbeam as a tool that you used to identify strategically partners that are using type form a 10, our customers.

326
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,800
Yep.

327
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:32,500
Yeah, so you can share your overlap with a potential partner and you can see what your overlap is and Prospects.

328
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,700
You can see what it is and paying customers.

329
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,800
You can kind of see that full picture which definitely helps prioritize.

330
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:54,800
I know it's a way that we have prioritized our Integrations and kind of what product level work goes into it as well, because we can see, you know, once the we want To get the biggest bang for our efforts.

331
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,700
Oh, because it takes a lot of work.

332
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,200
Yeah, to have to get these Partnerships.

333
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,500
I mean, the process you walked us through, you know, that takes some work to get done.

334
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:12,400
So it makes sense that you guys want to be very strategic with where you place your resources time and efforts.

335
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,400
Awesome.

336
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,000
Okay, here's another question from Angela.

337
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,500
Do you manage referral reward programs?

338
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:27,199
If so, do you use any tools to manage those programs and awarding perks to your Partnerships?

339
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,000
Yeah.

340
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,800
So it's a great question.

341
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:43,600
We do have a referral reward programs, it's a rev-share model with those agencies that I spoke about, and we managed that all through partner stack which is a partner or CRM tool.

342
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:58,200
And so they will see their rewards referrals, they will see click signups, and they will also get our we have a certification program that also lives in partner stack so it's a way for us to kind of how's everything?

343
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,700
And if we wanted to email a bunch of our partners all at once, we can do that.

344
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,800
Also, through Partner stock That's great.

345
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,200
So then go piggybacking off of Angela's question.

346
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:19,100
As far as your Tech stack of what helps you get, your day-to-day work done, how would you map that out?

347
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,800
Yeah, I would say I use partner sock, the most for sure, and then type form.

348
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:37,800
We use a lot for our or like, for applications for working with cross-functional teams for, you know, our sales, team needs, a partner to get involved to close a deal.

349
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,900
They submitted type form to us and that, and then we connect that with slack.

350
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:48,700
So I think there's a lot of productivity hacks and you could almost have an entire session on that.

351
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,000
I love learning more productivity hacks and all about automation that you can use.

352
00:35:54,300 --> 00:36:01,300
And, so I would say, partner stack, typeform, slack, those are the most that I personally use.

353
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:12,500
I know on the other side of our Partnerships team, they use crossbeam a lot and seeing overlap more for their Partnerships make sense, okay?

354
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,300
Great.

355
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,200
And then as far as slack, do you create slack groups for each of your partners?

356
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,000
Or how do you manage communication with Partners in Slack?

357
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,700
That's a great question.

358
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:36,000
We have I think it depends on we try and stay away from it unless that's exactly how the partner wants to communicate.

359
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:44,000
The reason being is you don't want to have a million slack messages from your partner is just Vic.

360
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,200
A lot of times they will ask a question where it will build, you know resolve it on their own as well.

361
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,900
So we encourage them to reach out to us on Partner stack.

362
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,300
Messaging because it's just easier.

363
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,100
And that's where all their referrals and information is.

364
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:08,000
So it's one platform, but we do, you know, make exceptions for a certain Partners if that's kind of the only way to communicate with them.

365
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Then we will make it work but That's great.

366
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:24,500
It's always, you know, these details of how you work together, how we work to the community that can either like make or break these experiences and ultimately the productivity.

367
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,900
So that's why I ask those kind of questions.

368
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:40,700
Yeah, and I think, I mean, I think traditional ways of communicating are kind of being thrown out the window now and it's all what works best for a partner or for yourself and your own productivity.

369
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:52,900
So I think it's just Being flexible on what people like to do, some people don't like to get on Zoom or like, some people are video shy, and they prefer to go over email, you know?

370
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,000
You just have to be flexible.

371
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:09,100
So with that, we would love to wrap up with a point of advice or any encouragement that you have for the overall B2B Tech Community.

372
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:15,600
This morning, we heard the news about meta Letting Go almost 11,000 employees.

373
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:26,000
Salesforce, there's a lot of these lip layoffs, taking place left and right and it's just a hard time to see your friends and fellow colleagues go through all of this.

374
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,700
So you know, just being mindful of what's happening today.

375
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:40,100
And then also just, you know, with the best practices that we're all learning they today, is there anything that you would offer out there as advice or encouragement?

376
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:51,300
Yeah, I would say, as far as the layoffs and everything going on in the tech world, that can be kind of nerve-racking to see everything that's going on.

377
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:57,000
But you are not defined by your job, you know, you bring a lot of skills to the table.

378
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,500
So even if you are laid off, you know, there's a lot of opportunities out there.

379
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,300
There are areas of tech that are still growing a ton.

380
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:12,300
And, so I would say just kind of keep your head up and it's not you.

381
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,100
It's your fault and yeah, keep pushing forward.

382
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,000
And see, where can you go from here?

383
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,100
That's awesome.

384
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,100
Alright well thank you so much Mattea, really appreciate your time.

32
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:38,300

34
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,000
Awesome.

35
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,800
I handed over to you, Emily.

36
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,000
Hi, everyone.

37
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,100
I am Emily.

38
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,000
I am a technical marketing manager.

39
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,400
Over a troll Works where an account based platform focused on helping our customers deliver or in find and deliver.

40
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,300
Their most high-quality leads, I have been a troll works for about three years and super excited to chat with you all today.

41
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,800
Thanks, Emily.

42
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,600
Daniel.

43
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:15,100
Oh, hey, sorry, I am having some technical difficulties here but hopefully everybody can hear me.

44
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,500
I head up the SDR team here at roll.

45
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,600
Works been doing it for it.

46
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,900
Would take about 15 or so years and just love the space.

47
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,200
I have been with companies like Marketo, semantics Aruba Networks and so forth.

48
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,800
So very happy to be here and To be with this amazing panel.

49
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,900
Thanks, Daniel asuman.

50
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,800
Hey, Gina Suman CEO and co-founder of Marco equally excited to be here.

51
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
As part of the panel.

52
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:55,800
Similar to what Brian said, what we're building at Marco is really centered around, making the human kind of connection through experiences more accessible.

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,200
So, so excited to be here Great, thank you all.

54
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Alright, so, you know, in this age of big data and automation, it's so important.

55
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,400
I mean, even more than that, let us layer on what's Happening across Tech with layoffs and recession uncertainty.

56
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,600
So, even more.

57
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:28,300
So, in the sea of emails ads calls, it's like, I feel like every B2B marketer is completely Reinventing how they approach marketing with tighter budgets and being a lot smarter.

58
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,500
Smarter and more performance data driven.

59
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:42,900
So human centricity across the customer journey is going to stand out over the others and you know, how we're defining human to human marketing.

60
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:54,000
And I would love to hear each of your definitions to this too, but it's a way you can see and interact with your customers as human first and customers second.

61
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,300
So let us unpack this a little more how to each of you.

62
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,500
Human to human experiences.

63
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,300
In go-to-market across each of your relative areas of responsibility.

64
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,300
I can hop in here.

65
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,300
So I think I was thinking about how to answer this question.

66
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,800
And first of all, in my opinion, how you think about like marketing or sales?

67
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:28,400
Just generally is helpful and so to us, you know, marketing and sales is really educating customers and then kind of selling your offering ultimately.

68
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,600
But a lot of people talk about sales and marketing really is being able to find customer pain.

69
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,900
And so they're not going to folks are going to listen to you as customers and purchase from you.

70
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,799
If you don't really Understand their problems.

71
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:51,500
So for us I think you're much more likely to find that pain if you come at it from a human angle so you actually have empathy for your customers and I think you mentioned a couple of themes.

72
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,900
One is like big data and how do you kind of Leverage that but also, how do you be human at the same time?

73
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,000
And I think those aren't mutually exclusive to us, right?

74
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:18,700
So you can still have a robust kind of data me, analytics, and use those to measure kind of how ethicacy of your marketing programs but still show up as a human still listen to your Various still use that to inform how you show up in individual interactions, as well as how that manifests in your overall brand and your value proposition.

75
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,200
So yeah, I think fundamentally, you know, having that as part of how you view marketing is a function to us is super important.

76
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,200
Little bit duplicative to that is, it's all about the connections.

77
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:49,700
You create with the people you're speaking to and, you know, in an age of video that has completely turned our Outreach upside down, the human connection is much harder to make without walking through the hallways and sitting in a conference room with your clients and Prospects.

78
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,700
So finding new ways to make those connections is vital to the growth of, you know, marketing and sales organizations.

79
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,400
So having I am these new opportunities to do.

80
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,100
So, through companies like mine.

81
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,500
It's a do.

82
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:11,000
So, and Marco and roll words, these are just things you have to have in your Tech stack in order to create these connections moving forward.

83
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,500
So it's all to me and to us, it's know so it's all about.

84
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,500
What is that human connection mean and how do you get there quickly?

85
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:27,900
For me, for me, from a marketing perspective, I really do think about human to human experiences.

86
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:35,600
Like I think all of you said is as finding those pain points that your customers are having and really providing them with those actionable Solutions.

87
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,700
And then I am also thinking about how we can get really focused on the Right audience for those programs.

88
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:49,200
So using all the data at our fingertips, thinking about how I can make my programs be more one-to-one or one too few?

89
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Even if they are one of the few, how can I make them feel more one-to-one?

90
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:04,700
So part of that is just getting really focused on who has the highest likelihood of buying right now who's raising their hands wanting to talk to sales and then really tightening up that messaging.

91
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,900
So you know what your audience cares about?

92
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:13,400
You're not throwing out 20 different messages at once and just hoping one sticks were able to deliver the right message every time.

93
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,900
Yeah, that's something that I just wanted to Echo.

94
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,000
You know what Emily said, right?

95
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,100
We tend to talk about, you know, being empathetic, being personalized and so forth in our Outreach.

96
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,700
But like before you even get to that point, right?

97
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:39,700
I think you need to take a, you know, broader, you know, look at things and really think about it from a 30,000 foot view what that really means, right?

98
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,700
So for us it's really taking that customer Obsession that everybody.

99
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,900
It's about its one of those buzzwords and operationalizing it, right?

100
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,000
So what I mean by that is you know Emily talked about this, right?

101
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,300
Reaching out to the right people with the topic that they care about, at that time, right?

102
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:04,400
So we have Technologies today that are available to help us get a lot more focused, you know.

103
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,200
So we're not, you know, spraying and praying sort of speak, right?

104
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,300
Or even in a situation where you try and personalize the message, but it's not the right message at that time.

105
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,000
It's a miss, right?

106
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:33,600
So as much as you want to do that, you know, good work of, you know, getting into the weeds personalizing really looking up, you know, someone's background or doing research on the company, you got to step back a little bit and just make sure is this the right company and the right person to reach out to at this point, right?

107
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,200
Because that's going to be a huge, huge piece of it.

108
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:44,700
The other thing that I like to think about that, we do really well here internally, you know a troll works, is it?

109
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,800
Not just about the handoff these days, right?

110
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,500
It's a lot about the cross functional overlap, right?

111
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,600
It may be a situation, Emily, what?

112
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,200
Then I will talk about this later where, you know, there is an initial hand off, but then it gets Revisited, right?

113
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,600
Like she's just going to jump in afterwards then nasty.

114
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,900
Our team is going to jump in and so forth, right?

115
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:13,100
So you really got to think through this in terms of the human to human component, from operational perspective as well.

116
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,700
And not just coach people.

117
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:21,100
People to talk about, you know, specific items that, you know, or messaging that's going to be relevant.

118
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,100
Yeah.

119
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,600
Oh, go ahead, jump in.

120
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:32,900
No, I was just going to say I think it's sometimes helpful to giving anecdotes for some of these things we can't talk about it.

121
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,400
Conceptually.

122
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,100
So give one which is what we something we were doing with internally with their team.

123
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:44,300
So Marco helps companies build culture through event so that could be virtual personal TD Retreat.

124
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:58,700
And one of the things we do, and we're trying to operationalize to delete danilo's point is we did a retreat for a company went well but then now we're operationalizing kind of pre and post sale kind of conversations and Vague.

125
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:28,000
And I joined one yesterday with a great company and mental health space and learned a lot from a human who was a customer and a happy customer but then walked away with their from the conversation with the head of sales saying, oh these are you know various things we did clarify within our offering or improve and this is how we're going to sell again, but that's almost like a nice knock-on effect but really the important thing was we were able to form a human connection and really View.

126
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:36,800
Do the relationship as a partnership versus just kind of transactional sale, which I think is really helpful, particularly, we're fairly early stage, right?

127
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:51,000
So for us, getting feedback from customers is truly, I mean, I think it is always a gift, but it's particularly more so a gift as you're, as you're really kind of iterating on the product in the offering to us, that to me, that's a good example.

128
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:58,000
And then I attended an event yesterday with a company called Mutiny, which is basically they optimize your landing pages with kind of AI.

129
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,100
Really cool company.

130
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:06,300
And one of the individuals there have looked into me and, you know, looked into what Market was, and that sort of thing.

131
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,100
And, and we had a good conversation.

132
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,500
And then we both talked about how we might build work together, help each other, and so that, but I will remember that person, right?

133
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
And kind of their story.

134
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,800
And so, at the end of the day, we are all human rights.

135
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,400
All of us on this call and all the folks listening.

136
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,800
So, I think that's important to keep in mind, especially in a time when things can be quite stressful.

137
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:41,600
And you're kind of Doom scrolling on the news and Twitter and then just sometimes reminding yourself that like the person on the other side of the conversation is in kind of row in a spreadsheet that you're trying to optimize, but they're human being is helpful.

138
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:53,500
Yeah, and I want to Echo that, right because a lot of times, you know, what happens is people you know really fixate on the short-term, right?

139
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:53,700
Sure.

140
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,600
We all have a quarter.

141
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,200
We need a head, right?

142
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,000
It's cute for we got a closed business.

143
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
CL from a Str perspective.

144
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,400
How do we build that pipeline, right?

145
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:11,600
And see that immediacy but, you know, to your point sumon on this one, you got to think about, you know, building that relationship.

146
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,800
You got to think about the long game and a lot of people on the collar like, well, that doesn't help me right now.

147
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
Yeah, it doesn't.

148
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:28,000
But it will come around right, and so I always, you know, talk about this from an SD, our perspective, it's not just about book in the meeting right now.

149
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:35,400
Oh, it's about, you know, incorporating, you know, the nurture piece of it into the equation.

150
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,400
It's not just the responsibility of the marketing team to do that.

151
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,300
You got to do that from a sales perspective.

152
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:49,000
You got to do that from a Str perspective, you know, so much spot on man with building that relationship.

153
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
That's, that's, that's what it's about.

154
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,900
That's really powerful.

155
00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:06,700
What you're beginning to describe, especially with the I meant the one team alignment between sales and marketing to really make that human touch authentic and meaningful across the funnel.

156
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:23,000
I would love to double-click a little bit more into the strategies like a cross across a process, but before we go into strategies and tactics, you know, we were talking a little bit about some of the vital qualities of human-to-human marketing.

157
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,400
So just continuing to unravel a little bit more of that.

158
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:33,900
Meaning like, okay, so we're talking about being human and yeah, it's like, duh, we should know what that's like.

159
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,100
But what is that?

160
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,700
What are some of the key qualities that you all are seeing?

161
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,800
That's translating over into the work that you do?

162
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,000
I think the human to human interactions.

163
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,100
Are obviously their personalized, transparent authentic, but at the same time, something really important.

164
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,000
There's their also really timely.

165
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:14,100
So, as marketers and the salespeople, we have so many data at our fingertips, that we can use to really Target somebody with the right message at the right time, the right buying Persona, so I Rovers freezing, our own product to define journey stages, basically, buying stages that I work with Noah, and his team on defining.

166
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,100
It's kind of two-way street.

167
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,700
There were able to get a really clear picture by a combined combining data from our CRM.

168
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,000
So that's like sales engagement or marketing.

169
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,800
Automation platform, more of those like form fills campaign responses, intent data and then website engagement to get a really clear picture of where somebody's at in their buying journey.

170
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:44,400
And from there, we can really zero in on, you know, the people that are sales ready, raising their hands and from the marketing side we're going after those folks with air cover.

171
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:56,900
Odds, nurture, emails Etc but then from the sales side, Nolan has teams using that information to really reach out to those people at the right time and were able to identify what message is going to work right for them.

172
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:10,100
And then even create Dynamic campaigns that can change the offer or message depending on when the final stage changes to really, just support the sales team and stay top of Mind against competition.

173
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,800
Yeah, just to add to that, just very basic things that are really important.

174
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,600
It's, you know, I think the know who you're talking to piece really helps create that experience.

175
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:37,100
If you know, you're going to be speaking to someone who is in a VM, why you talk, while you tell them how your use cases for sales of Client Services can benefit them, they don't care, right?

176
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,300
So if you create the conversation on what they care about, that's really important.

177
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,900
And that alone will create this personal Human Experience because now you're having a conversation about what they really care about.

178
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,700
Sometimes you just miss the basics.

179
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,900
Hmm.

180
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,900
So can we dive into some of the tools?

181
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,100
Like what our strategy and tools that you're starting to touch it?

182
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:11,000
Emily, you know, cross funnel, but what are some key strategies and tools that, and we can start from even at the awareness part of the funnel and let us make our way all the way through.

183
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:19,200
So just from that initial touch point because there was a recent Forrester stat that said that it requires close to 27.

184
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,700
All touch points for the average B2B buyer.

185
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,400
These days post pandemic.

186
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,200
It might even be more than that.

187
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,400
And majority of that exploration of the buyer is taking place so low and that's how they want it.

188
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,400
So how are we making that experience human?

189
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:48,900
Well, I mean, I am a little passionate around this, you know, in and I get a little irritated by the stats.

190
00:20:49,100 --> 00:21:02,300
You know, because I will be honest, you know, you hear these stats and it's, you know, and what happens, you know, you have the SDR is that are basically adopting that, right?

191
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:12,700
And you got Str teams that are like emulating that and, you know, quite honestly, you know, Actuated and reinforcing that narrative, right?

192
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:23,700
Because will hero, you got to have a sequence as, you know, 13, 14 touches, right and Outreach or salesloft, or, you know, whatever tool you're using out there.

193
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:36,300
And as opposed to figuring out a way to cut that amount of interaction down, we just actually create those sequences that long and just reinforce it, right?

194
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,300
And that's brutal.

195
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:46,000
Because if you're on the other end of it, It, you know, you're opting for more of a, you know, quantity than a quality approach, right?

196
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:53,100
And so, you know, the goodness is, in the details doubles, not in the details, it's a goodness.

197
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
That's in the details right now, like that.

198
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:08,400
Well, you know, that just to give a shot out to get O'Brien of the team out there at Sand, do, so we use the heck out of, so do, so I don't care what our budget is forced to do.

199
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,900
So if we're booking Things like let us get that budget as big as possible.

200
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,400
So Brian and closing some deals here for you.

201
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,400
But like, that's the approach you want to take, right?

202
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,900
Is it's not about throwing out a, you know, Amazon gift card.

203
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,300
Right?

204
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,400
It's about, you know, maybe doing a, you know, Wellness kit.

205
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,500
Emily can talk a little bit about that or you see somebody that you know, has you know pets.

206
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,200
You know you're doing a kit for, you know for dogs.

207
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I got three of them.

208
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:47,200
So if I am getting a Centos will gift, you know, that's pet-related got one of those lazy dogs, right next?

209
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,000
To me, sleep in a way as I am on a webinar, right?

210
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,400
So you just got to get more relevant with what you're actually putting out there, right?

211
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,800
And not taking the, you know, oh, it's sticking to take 27 touches.

212
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,000
Okay, well that maybe you know what we're doing.

213
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,700
Now, how do we get that?

214
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,300
Like 12 or a Right?

215
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:26,500
So that we're providing a lot more relevancy to what they're going to digest versus that, you know, mentality of like, I am going to choke you with so much information until you know, scream uncle and okay.

216
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,200
Sure you're going to.

217
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,900
You're going to hear back from me, right?

218
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,700
But it's going to be a no, right?

219
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,100
Or it's going to be a knock-down.

220
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,100
So I know I went off there a little bit, but I am just passionate about this.

221
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:52,100
Yeah, it's Really, really important to me that our team is providing value to the folks on the other end and be mindful of when do we get those replies?

222
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:58,100
Are we getting them on step 3, or is it 9:00, you know, and how do we get better?

223
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,100
So I will shut up and pass the someone else greens.

224
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,400
I think you missed the fine print on that survey.

225
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,100
It said, if you're doing things, the way you were 10 years ago, it's going to take you 27.

226
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,500
Right?

227
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,300
We need to change the way you're doing your Outreach, and lean on the new things that are in Market to help you get there.

228
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,600
So do so obviously being one of them.

229
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,400
So, thank you for the shout out but there are things you can be doing differently.

230
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,100
It's the stale organizations that are still happy.

231
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,600
That's trouble.

232
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,400
That's kind of funny.

233
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,500
So I sent an email to a we're doing it.

234
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,100
We do events for internal and external use cases.

235
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
So, we're doing ahead of community of that.

236
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:44,900
We will often sell to VCS or heads of community at companies, and they do a bunch of events to activate their Community as commercial interest and so forth.

237
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,100
But we're doing this really curated event with Robert.

238
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,000
Who's the founder of daybreaker?

239
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,800
It's amazing Community.

240
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,900
She's also an entrepreneur.

241
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:02,300
She wrote a book called The Long, which is about community building, and then we invited the head of Immunity who hadn't responded to a few emails of mine in a bit for this BC.

242
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,000
And she immediately goes, oh my gosh, this looks amazing.

243
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,100
I actually can't make it.

244
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,700
But thank you so much for the invite.

245
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:14,100
I am going to invite this, you know, had a couple of my people from my firm join unless definitely catch up as soon as possible.

246
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:21,600
So it's kind of interesting because, of course, we have certain sequences, and we're figuring out who to Target, but that resonated, right?

247
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,000
And so, it resonated because we thought about the actual format of what that what we're asking.

248
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,400
Yeah.

249
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:34,200
Ask given a skit, hopefully that experience should be providing value to them the same way.

250
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,500
I mean, Junior putting this together.

251
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:41,100
Hopefully folks, on this, on this call can get some value, and it's not just a one-way value Street.

252
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,200
You're asking, and receiving as well, but So good.

253
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:53,100
So what are some strategies and tactics that we have a sense?

254
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,200
Clearly not working.

255
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:05,600
So that's the inundation all of us are experiencing right now with emails ads and it's not really resonating, you know, but what is working.

256
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,800
So what have you all been doing it?

257
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:13,500
Like, are there any strategies or creative ideas that you're currently implementing?

258
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,400
That's really working?

259
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Well, I can touch on the wellness kit that Danilo mentioned.

260
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:25,900
So basically all of our reps have this Wellness kit has like chicken noodle soup.

261
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:33,900
Like all things kind of comfort related in this Wellness kit and all of our reps have access to some this, to their customers and their prospects.

262
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:45,800
But we initially launched this, it was because we were getting a lot of feedback from Danilo and his team that they were seeing open rates were down, reply rates were down, and we really needed to find a way.

263
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,900
To re-engage this audience.

264
00:26:48,600 --> 00:27:01,000
So we pulled our Target account list of all the people that had been not responding to emails but had responded to us in the past and basically acknowledged that it was, it was early winter.

265
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,200
A lot of people were under the weather understanding that when they kind of come back, they're probably going to have a really increased workload.

266
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,500
So what can we do to help them on both friends there?

267
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,800
So, we sent them this Wellness kit to help them kind of recover as they come back into work.

268
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:22,500
And then we're also pairing that with something helpful to help them, you know, hit the ground running once they come back into the office.

269
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,800
So we paired it with our AVM play generator.

270
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,600
Hello and his team were going out to customize and Prospects that way.

271
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,100
But then on the marketing side we were providing air cover ads with very, very simple.

272
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,500
Add to this audience with no CTA.

273
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,400
It just had some text on it.

274
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,800
That said, check your email from us, this actually increased open rates about 20% across this email program.

275
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:53,000
And then, after once, once the people started redeeming, we started targeting them with those a VM play generator ads.

276
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:04,200
We were able to see about an 11% redeemed opportunity, right on this, just by getting sales to open the or just by getting this gift, kind of opened the door for sales to really build those relationships.

277
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,400
Right on.

278
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,600
Stephen were even jumping?

279
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,400
No, I was purely saying that.

280
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,100
I think I love that.

281
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,000
That's a great idea.

282
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,400
That was the extent of my reaction but I can say some other stuff if you'd like.

283
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,700
I mean if you have got anything else to contribute to what's working for you all.

284
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,100
Yeah, it's interesting.

285
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,100
I guess so, you know, on this subject of tools for us.

286
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,800
So we are doing a lot of testing on paid marketing and growth rate.

287
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:42,400
And what we have realized is from our experiences, the interesting thing for us is even though we're beat to be part of what we do.

288
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,700
Feels consumer II.

289
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,500
Yeah, consumer-friendly in nature.

290
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:52,900
It's B2B to see the ultimate consumer is the employee or the Community member from the experiences events kind of standpoint.

291
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:03,600
So, some folks actually don't necessarily from a product experience perspective, actually, just want to shop as they would normally, on a Marketplace, like Airbnb experiences or whatever it is.

292
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:09,500
And then we have higher complexity products whether it's like a venue by outdoor Retreat or some newer.

293
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,200
He's spending a lot of money and it's more.

294
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:17,800
Flex where you really want to talk to someone and then it's like, how do we actually structure our lead flow?

295
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,800
And we only have so many people right?

296
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,100
Steph.

297
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,600
So then with that multi kind of variable equation we're thinking about.

298
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,000
Okay.

299
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,300
How do we how does that inform product roadmap around?

300
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,400
What should be what ought to be self cert?

301
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:47,100
And I think this applies for mobile view be SAS as well, which is okay, you know, how really there should be damned for eternity to perhaps, you know, learn as much as you can and then at the right moment, bringing that human because you may not want to have a certain interaction and you may want to.

302
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,100
I can actually mutiny is an example where they have a really great product.

303
00:29:51,100 --> 00:30:02,500
LED growth component, where you can actually literally redesign your website with beauty and so you can see the value of it and that I am like, oh gosh, I really want to talk to someone over there.

304
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:11,200
And so it's this interesting Dynamic around human centricity, doesn't have to mean also to nil.

305
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:23,400
Point, you know, let us just talk to people as much as we can and now I heard this buzzword called human to human interaction and how we were going to throw all our humans out to interact with many people as possible.

306
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,500
I think if you hear some of these buzzwords that I think it's the same way of like growth hacking.

307
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:33,600
People are right about growth hacking, and then they're like okay cool, we're gonna like create all these tests we're going to get all these customers.

308
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,800
I think it's really taking that phrase in understanding how it ought to apply to your customer.

309
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:49,900
So in our case, it's kind of like okay well Who do we, who should we talk to both from, you know, ability to solve their problems and bandwidth of our team.

310
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,900
And that's how we're prioritizing kind of sales interactions.

311
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,000
It?

312
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:02,100
Ultimately, when we build more product is features for the high complexity stuff within our business, it will also still serve up human interaction in the right time.

313
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:09,600
So we think about it in the context of not only sales and marketing but also product and other kind of areas of our business.

314
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,800
But one other thing to touch on, just following up on what Emily said.

315
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:30,000
And as you can see, you know, just from the examples that Emily share, and we're very spoiled here, we have got an amazing marketing team and it's just amazing partnership, right?

316
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,800
So it just goes back to what I was saying.

317
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:38,900
I think when we first started about, you know, the cross-functional team work, right?

318
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,600
The overlap, right?

319
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,500
So you No Emily shared.

320
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:50,400
You know, an example or two, there are a couple things that stand out to me, you know, is you know, the high engagers, right?

321
00:31:50,400 --> 00:32:04,600
So if we have, you know, folks that are out there, you know, and you can tell this through Outreach or salesloft, or any of these platforms who's clicking on your links who's opening and multiple times, and so forth.

322
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:11,100
So, you know, that those folks are interested, but there's something that's preventing them from, you know, replying to you.

323
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:19,900
And Aim, you know whether it's hey, we're not quite ready this quarter, or we may be, you know, there's a budget constraint.

324
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:25,500
I mean, that's your the climate that we're in, you know, today, for example.

325
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:41,400
But you know, we do a really, really good job of marketing providing that are cover and jumping in with additional channels to really unstuck those folks, right?

326
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:52,000
And so we will try a few different messages and depending on which message, they resonate, we kind of shift our mindset here to address that pain point.

327
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,800
Right?

328
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:58,100
Because, you know, typically you have that messaging that's like industry-focused, right?

329
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:04,000
You have messaging, that's, you know, related to a particular product or so forth, right?

330
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:10,800
But that's just doesn't cut it these days anymore, you got to go the Step Beyond and understand.

331
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,400
Okay.

332
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,700
Well, maybe it's dependent on the tech that they use, right?

333
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,800
Could that be a trigger for what you know, messaging we want to use, right?

334
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,600
So we have an amazing integration with HubSpot, for example, right?

335
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,000
That you know, we want to know if that's a driver, right?

336
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So our marketing team does incredible job, you know, providing that are cover and putting those messages in and depending on what they're actually clicking on.

337
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,800
You know, we're able to actually then get even a lot more.

338
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,100
Or you know what the messaging Emily.

339
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:57,100
I don't know if you want to jump in with an additional comment on that, but I think you all do an amazing job when it comes to that type of stuff to harm us with, you know, necessary tools from a messaging perspective.

340
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,100
Thanks, Noah.

341
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,900
Well, I grew I can definitely touch on that.

342
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,200
I definitely think that we use our marketing automation platform.

343
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:20,500
So much to kind of identify when these customers are responding to campaigns that are relevant to you know, certain topics certain Integrations, and then we also track who's visiting those pages, and we have trigger set up.

344
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:35,400
So if somebody lands on a page that talks about are how spotted integration they're immediately going to be getting an email, it's usually going to From that assigned sales rep, just kind of continue building that relationship and make it feel like it's a human talking to another human.

345
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,900
Just going to be giving them more information.

346
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:52,199
It's very like light message just acknowledging that they have been looking at some of this content across the web and what can we do to help their experience be a little bit better and what can we do to help them?

347
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,400
So rich, these are, these are like some amazing key insights and tips.

348
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,700
Brian, where you go to say something?

349
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:02,600
Yeah.

350
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:29,000
Just going to add some of the a really focused on internally is to make sure we're focused on the full customer journey and where, as Danilo said, not just sending stuff to send stuff, I think the only other good thing about having a sending strategy within your Outreach programs is if I is to send, you know, a few ten emails to Danilo, and he wasn't getting back to me.

351
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,800
But then I sent him a bone for his dog.

352
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,700
We might be like, well for one second, that's creepy, but then he's like my dog.

353
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:44,100
So I think the one place where you can get beyond the creepy is by sending someone a gift if it's going to work.

354
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:50,000
And if this personalized and it's something that they can use, then all the creepiness goes away.

355
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,400
So using the data to learn about people, and then using that as a benefit to you, We will break through the Clutter.

356
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:09,200
Yeah, I think is, is again why we built what we built its and do so, but the externally, you know, you want to make sure that you're getting into our clients workflows.

357
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:25,100
So, to Emily's point the usage of or Danilo uses of HubSpot and all these other Technologies, we want to make sure that the doses available to you in those platforms so that as a client, you're able to streamline her entire process without having to go into multiple that forms.

358
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,900
So I think that's a really big way we personalize for our clients.

359
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,100
That's great.

360
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,500
Yeah, that's a really good point that Brian just brought up, right?

361
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:50,600
Because, you know, the more you need to go into, you know, different areas, you know, to find information, you know, human nature, right?

362
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,800
The less you're going to do it.

363
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,100
Hey, you know, let us be honest, right?

364
00:36:54,100 --> 00:37:05,700
We can preach, you know, about it, and we will get a lot of head nods but you know, you have to have a platform that's going to be, you know, Little more inclusive, right?

365
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,800
That's going to be in the tools that you're currently, you know, your sales team in your SD, our team live it, right?

366
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:20,400
So whether its sales force was, its HubSpot or, you know, one of the other, you know, crms out there and, you know, that's, that's what we do here.

367
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:27,400
You know, a troll works as well as you know if you think about sales, you think about, you know, the Str realm.

368
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,000
You want to be multi-threaded, right?

369
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:40,500
What you don't want is You know, going after something that is very, very specific to that one particular person.

370
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:40,800
Sure.

371
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,500
You can personalize it, based on, you know, send me a bone Brian any time for my dogs, by the way.

372
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:52,000
But you don't want to just rely on that piece of information, right?

373
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:59,300
There's buying committees that these days are, you know if you're looking at strategic accounts, right?

374
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:09,800
I mean could be 1520 people even with smaller organizations when You know, all our sales team pulls me in on calls to say, hey, how does Roller Shoes roll works?

375
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,800
You know, there's two to three people on those calls, right at the very minimum, right?

376
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,500
And that's just, you know, people that are into buying committee that are on the sales side, right?

377
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:25,700
So, you want to make sure that as you're personalizing, this approach, you don't lose sight of that, right?

378
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,400
It's not just about that individual.

379
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:33,900
It's about, you know how that individual, you know, is basically.

380
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,100
We interact with other people within that organization.

381
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,900
So if you can see those data points, bring that into the conversation, right?

382
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:50,500
Because they have got folks that they're working with internally, just like I work very, very closely with Emily and the rest of the marketing team.

383
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,800
I think one app one interesting point is to throw back, but how to win, friends and influence people?

384
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,300
I see a lot of folks have read the book, and I was just pulling it up to.

385
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,900
There're six ways to make people, like you or become genuinely interested.

386
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,800
In other people.

387
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,500
Another really interesting is remembered the person's name.

388
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Be a good listener.

389
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,500
Talk in terms of other people's interest and make the other person feel important sincerely.

390
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,900
So you think about those lessons?

391
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:25,800
Those are few that have always people always known What is the anecdote that Carnegie would write people's Nate?

392
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,700
They have got on a note card and practice, you know what they're interested in now?

393
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,000
We have all these tools, right?

394
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:44,400
So we have C, we have sophisticated crms, we have multiple systems that can tell you, when you should say all that stuff with technology, whether it's in whatever Channel, it is, right, whether it's email or SMS, or whatever, whatever channel.

395
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:50,400
So I think taking those lessons and then taking, you know, with a beginner's mind set around.

396
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,000
Okay, now I have all this technology.

397
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,400
How do I do that?

398
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,400
And then do it authentically because if you just take it and then you're like, cool.

399
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,800
Now, I am going to send everyone dog bones and like Willie, that's right, not going to work, right?

400
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:09,300
But if you do it the right way, then with Brian and Danielle of might work, but Love that book.

401
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,500
If you got the lake, feel free to drop it in chat for us.

402
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,000
Human.

403
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,800
I have I just put up the best summary of How to Win Friends and Influence People to well, alright, whatever you got, I think this is irrelevant.

404
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:31,400
So, talking about high intent and really being able to identify that across a buyer Journey.

405
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,300
Some of you have mentioned using your current CRM tools.

406
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,200
Like what are you guys using like, a sixth sense?

407
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,300
What tools are you using to track that?

408
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:46,900
And how are you continuing to keep tabs and alignment with your marketing and sales teams?

409
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:55,200
We're using our own tool roll Works to do a lot of this from a marketing perspective.

410
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,100
We're able to create Dynamic campaigns.

411
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:08,300
Based that change the messaging based on what Journey stage or what buying stage somebody might be in and then that information is also being transferred over to our CRM.

412
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:17,900
So our sales reps are also able to see the same thing and use that to really prioritize which accounts to reach out to First and what kinds of messages might resonate with those customers or prospects.

413
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,700
Yeah, just to follow up on what Emily said, right?

414
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:37,000
You know what's great about having a, you know, comprehensive ABM platform is that, you know, it can you know, really coordinate help coordinate those efforts right?

415
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,900
So what you know Emily was talking about in terms of Journey stages right?

416
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:52,400
What them you know for us means is you know think of as an accounts for right like an account stage score You know, whatever term you want to use.

417
00:41:52,800 --> 00:42:12,200
So, you know, it helps us, you know, from a perspective of, you know, those additional signals, you know, understand you know, for example whether it's Marketo that you're using as a marketing automation platform or whether it's HubSpot, we want to understand those signals, right?

418
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,900
We want to understand, you know what links they're clicking on, right?

419
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:23,000
And we want to take, you know, T dat up and our product is called sales insights to the Str team.

420
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:32,400
So that way, as they're really reaching out and trying to personalize that message, you know, we do have that human a human, you know, connection, right?

421
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,800
So if I am reaching out, for example to Emily, I can say, hey, I notice your colleague.

422
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,600
Yeah.

423
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,900
You know, Susan or Bill, we're on the website.

424
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,900
There were checking out these pieces of content and so forth.

425
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,700
So it's a lot more relative you know, interaction.

426
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:53,900
Much more personalized that Of all the people at the organization and the buying committee, right?

427
00:42:53,900 --> 00:43:03,800
And tees it up for, you know, our sales development rep to have all those, you know, right there in the tool at their fingertips.

428
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,000
So that way we can, we can reference it right?

429
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,200
Because that's a piece of that personalization, right?

430
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,600
That we don't talk about.

431
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,400
It's like, the person that's kind of raising.

432
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:27,900
Their hand may not be the right person to reach out to, but you can certainly use their interaction with your Brand and your organization to actually make it a much more human conversation with the person that is relevant.

433
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:44,300
And that's become even more important today because of the economy that we're in, because of the layoffs that were going through, you know, marketing as a general profession is a rapid, you know as a revolving door.

434
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:54,500
So if you're only the multi-threading I think the no you said before has become even more important and there's there has to be a focus on that through these organizations.

435
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,700
Because number one, you might be talking to the wrong person, it doesn't have a decision ability.

436
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,800
Number two, that person your Champion might not be there tomorrow and then, what do you do?

437
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,100
Key point it's real.

438
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,300
All right.

439
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,600
Well we're going to have a magic show soon.

440
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:25,400
So just to wrap this time up, could each of you share any point of encouragement or advice or tip for the B2B go-to-market Community?

441
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,600
Brian, you just touched it.

442
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,500
It's a hard time right now, we're seeing on LinkedIn.

443
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,100
It's like a doom.

444
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:40,700
Scroll of just some of our friends in Tech, getting let go left and right at the same time we're seeing a lot of hiring opportunities also open up.

445
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:45,500
So it's a really up and down kind of experience.

446
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,400
What advice would you give to our community in just had to show up?

447
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,500
And any other pots.

448
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,400
This is there's a very open for you.

449
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,300
I could be a tactical point of advice as well.

450
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:08,100
Well, I will start as been mentioned but find the problem that you can solve and help the person solve it and then the biggest thing is don't waste anyone's time.

451
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,500
No one has a lot of time anymore to waste or to be wasted.

452
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:22,000
So if you come with a Subjective in a bowl that you can help them solve as a problem they're facing and their daily work life.

453
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,300
They're going to be more active listening into it.

454
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:32,500
So I think that's really important, especially in the first conversation Yeah, I would touch on that.

455
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,300
I just to give a shot out to, you know, our VP of sales here.

456
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:42,200
Sean you know, he's got an approach of like Choose Your Own Adventure, right?

457
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:51,600
So a lot of times, you know, you go into, you know, these sales Cycles would organizations right?

458
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,100
Yeah.

459
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:58,000
And you know it's helpful to just you know as Brian mentioned don't waste people's time, right?

460
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,400
Help them understand what.

461
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,600
It's the best course of action.

462
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:19,200
You know for them in terms of like an evaluation process right help guide them along the way and you know, we have got, you know, for different, you know, choose your adventures, you know, kind of, you know, sales cycle that we have walk people through, and we guide them, right?

463
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:27,800
So it's, you know, you hear a lot about, you know, solution selling walking people through it, but rarely do people live that right?

464
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,600
And really, you know, It's something like that.

465
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:40,200
So that's probably my advice is just, you know, give the folks out there a little more guidance in terms of, you know, how to go about it.

466
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,000
Right?

467
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:59,000
There's a lot of products out there a lot of confusing, you know, sometimes, you know, everybody sounds the same so help people walk through it and you know what they should look for, they should evaluate it and just be very genuine about it.

468
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:07,600
Thinking about what Brian and Danielle said to, I think, from a marketing perspective.

469
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:17,100
Like once, you have that account list really, really, well, defined what I often do when I am creating new campaigns, is just reading it over again and asking myself.

470
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:25,600
Like, is this actually helping the customer Prospect do their job and meet their personal and professional goals.

471
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,200
So we get oftentimes really wrapped up in our day-to-day work.

472
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,000
We sometimes forget, we're talking to another human.

473
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:39,700
On the other the side of the screen even if you're serving ads to an entire buying committee, there's only one person on the other side of the screen that's going to be looking at that ad.

474
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:52,500
So throughout the jargon really tighten up, your messaging focus on individuals, pain points and how your business can really help them achieve their professional and personal goals and hopefully close their laptop.

475
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,600
At the end of the day, just feeling a little bit less stress off their shoulders.

476
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,100
I would say so I live in New York.

477
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:15,800
One positive thing that happened recently was I didn't run the marathon, but I went to Central Park and solve like we're running a marathon, and they're just people just on the side just like cheering and Hi-Fi vegan and, you know, cheering honored strangers.

478
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,400
And, so I thought that was kind of uplifting because I was like, alright, Humanity, still not so bad.

479
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:27,300
You got hundreds of thousands of people out here just like happy to be kind of physically able to go on a run.

480
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:42,600
So I was like, That's doesn't have anything to be marketing but I think that was encouraging for me to see that and then also just you know marketing and sales you're talking to folks on the other side it's important for me is someone who's working with a great team at Marco.

481
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:55,600
To also remember to treat and get better and better at treating folks within our company as humans because I think you just mentioned like multi-threading and how are we all going to speak to the prospect in this in the certain way?

482
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,800
And I think it's important to speak to each other.

483
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,800
You have people that you work with super frequently in that way.

484
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,100
So then they can take that ethos and bring it forward to the End customer.

485
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:15,000
So it might be, it might be kind of rocky time in the economy but I think everything is cyclical and ways that I think just also remember that.

486
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,200
So, Right on.

487
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,100
Thank you all for sharing those insights.

488
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,100
My heart already.

489
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,600
Feels lifted from that.

490
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,800
Alright, so again, thank you to all our panelists.

491
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:34,700
We're going to transition now Suman, I am going to hand it over to you, because we have got a pretty exciting magic show with Kevin Blake.

492
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,500
So, hey everyone.

493
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,800
Let us see, do we?

494
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:49,700
I will tell him I will do a little kind of intro injury here because we have known each other for a while and it will cut to video.

495
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:59,300
So I said a little bit about Marco what we do is we help companies build culture through events that started off with like six hosts on a PDF, Kevin Blake was one of them.

496
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:09,000
And so he's been a great part of our journey, on the subject of kind of humanizing experiences, super talented, but really has this amazing ability to connect.

497
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,700
People through stories and 4-bit, suspend reality with magic.

498
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,900
So he's going to share a bit of that with us today.

499
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,500
Just a bit about his background.

500
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,200
Yeah, there we go.

501
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,500
There's Kevin, he is an Illusionist that Palace Theater.

502
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:33,900
He has performed in front of crowds from companies, as big as kind of Google and is Amazon, as small as Marco, and his done tons of shows with us virtually.

503
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:39,000
And in person throughout the pandemic and excited to call him a friend, as they one thing to Kevin.

504
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:45,300
Is he wrote hand wrote three people on our team, a letter once to Express gratitude for our partnership?

505
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,200
And so that I will always have had the thing is, Kevin has lost his voice.

506
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:56,200
So on the subject of being a human, Kevin is a wizard but also a human as well.

507
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:02,500
So he's been kind enough to join us still and figure out how to do some somewhat of a silent show here.

508
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:07,800
And, so I just wanted to come on really quickly and brag about Kevin and do it a bit.

509
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,800
A bit of an intro.

510
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:39,400
And so with that, I will pass it over to Kevin and Gina, perhaps we can bring someone from the, from the stage or I will I am so sorry.

511
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:10,100
Prophecy about deal.

512
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,800
All right, I got it.

513
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,700
Santa Claus.

514
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,000
I am curious.

515
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,000
18, 19, 20.

516
00:54:51,400 --> 00:55:05,000
30 31, 31, 32 33, 34 35 36.

517
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:26,800
Awesome.

518
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,100
Awesome.

519
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:49,900
Very good.

520
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:50,300
Kevin.

521
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:50,700
Thank you.

522
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,400
Quite impressed.

523
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:55,600

Awesome.

69
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Well I am really excited about the discussion that we're going to jump into before we do that.

70
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,500
I have got a few fun facts, and we love our fun facts.

71
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,000
Here.

72
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:33,300
So each of you also have fun facts are, so I will start with mine, I used to do a lot of Television, movies in my early 20s and I actually did a lot of work with Ugly Betty.

73
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,000
And so she was the lead actress, and I was in the back.

74
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,700
There's the shot right there, love that, and so I will hand it over to you Latin me.

75
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,300
What's a fun fact about you?

76
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,600
Well, I think I have about 200 pairs of shoes, maybe more.

77
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:05,600
So actually, my husband had to like, redo the attic crawl space to house them all.

78
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:14,400
So yeah, just you know, it's always a confidence booster when you're rocking a cool pair of shoes.

79
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,700
So there you go, upset, awesome.

80
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,400
I am handing it over to you Amanda.

81
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,600
I wish that was my fun fact.

82
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I want 200 pairs of shoes.

83
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:42,100
That's what I want my friend back to be mine is I am related to two of the three people who have ever broken out of Alcatraz which you know I guess as a marketer I am very crafty is the way that I will put that but really there.

84
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,600
I never knew them.

85
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,500
But a couple years ago we did the family tree through ancestry and discovered that.

86
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:49,700
Yeah.

87
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,300
Yeah, I am related to two of the three people like shared a shared.

88
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,800
A maiden name on my mother's side.

89
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,600
So wow.

90
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,300
That's an incredible fun fact.

91
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,600
I do love the rock Bethany and so it really was a full circle moment for me when I discovered this.

92
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,800
Yeah, crafty, that's how I am choosing.

93
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,800
Did you do that?

94
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,300
Awesome.

95
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,700
Well, thank you for sharing some of your fun facts jumping right into this conversation.

96
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:27,100
So, you know, as we know to set in the landscape here, Tech has been uncertain tumultuous to say the least.

97
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,700
Layoffs, marketing resources, budgets getting tighter.

98
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,300
Marketers needing to rethink the way we do marketing.

99
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:44,900
And we look at forecasting and budgeting, Amanda your team just Put together this amazing report on software, buyer behaviors.

100
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:53,300
And I think if there's any G2 team members, if y'all can drop that in chat, that's a really great report that we can take a look at and Latin me.

101
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,300
I have seen your LinkedIn post where you're tracking close with the Forester.

102
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,100
B2B Trends, drop in your predictions.

103
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,600
I mean, I just want to get the poles from each of you.

104
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:10,300
What are the key trends and insights that you're seeing, what do you agree with what do you disagree with?

105
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,600
With could you share with us your thoughts?

106
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:21,100
Well, I will share some of the insights from the G2 report, and then we maybe can take some of the themes I know Latin.

107
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,300
He's been focused on and tracking as well.

108
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,700
I think one of the key themes that we have seen for a couple of years now but was most acute in this research report?

109
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,100
Thank you.

110
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,900
Jenny just shared it here in the chat.

111
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,600
Was that more than ever buyers are looking to?

112
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:43,500
If you ask them what's your top source of influence when you're deciding, what you're going to use particularly for software those responses.

113
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,900
Has been overwhelmingly.

114
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,500
I am turning to my peers and influencers that I know and trust.

115
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:57,900
And so what that means for anyone, in who's looking for software marketing software is you really need to be thinking about whom, how am I leaning into Community?

116
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,400
Soul at knee, and sixth sense?

117
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:08,500
Has this amazing group of 2,000 plus CMOS and how am I allowing my customers to talk to other customers and potential prospects?

118
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:31,800
And certainly you know, peer reviews and G2 is a great way to do that but there's a whole host of other Are ways that you can lean into, you know, really peer influence to help potential buyers, make more informed decisions so that's one Trend we're seeing I think the other Trend we're seeing is that there's a lot more consolidation in software and text acts as people look to next year.

119
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,300
And so it just means the bar is higher.

120
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,900
It doesn't mean there's not opportunity.

121
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,800
There actually is a lot of opportunity in that statement, but it does mean the bar is higher.

122
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:48,100
So, for those who know me, I am a control freak, I try to let go but it's very challenging for me.

123
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,600
And, so I guess, first of all, you know, our number one job in marketing is the market.

124
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:04,000
And you know it makes us even more relevant when markets are changing, right?

125
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,400
We saw that with covid too.

126
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,100
And so, our job is to adjust to changing market conditions.

127
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,700
And help kind of steer the ship so to speak.

128
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:27,900
And I think that when the market is changing frequently there you got to control what you can control and to me, you know what I am advising and what we're working on is doing that and there's three big buckets for me.

129
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:40,600
One, is your ideal customer profile and it's so interesting to me how, you know, when times are good, you might not need to be as refined and diligent around this.

130
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:49,600
But when ties, maybe aren't as good, you have got to really understand your ideal customer profile and eliminate waste, right?

131
00:12:49,600 --> 00:13:01,000
Because if you're spending a lot of sales and marketing energy, and even product energy, just company, energy trying to be everything to everybody, you know.

132
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,600
I think you're going to quickly a struggle and so and you might need to rethink it.

133
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,000
So every time there's a shift in the market you need to reconsider you know, is that Deal customer profile.

134
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,700
Maybe there are more affected by this economy.

135
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,900
So, maybe we need to start to warm up, other, slivers of art, am that are less affected.

136
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,300
So, that's number one for stand.

137
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,200
First, and foremost ideal customer profile.

138
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,000
And then the in Market ideal customer profile, know those.

139
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,900
And then the second thing for me, is your message and your value prop.

140
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:45,400
So, you know, again, in times of abundance, You know, it's could be a different message, and value prop.

141
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,100
We're not in a time of abundance and so yeah.

142
00:13:49,100 --> 00:14:00,300
If you have a consolidation Story, Probably a good time to dust that one off right, you know, and I don't want to go out with an in these uncertain times.

143
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,800
Message.

144
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:10,900
That's pretty tired, but rethinking, you know, how what is your, what is your Mary thinking and feeling and needing right now?

145
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,200
Now, and how do you connect with them?

146
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:26,600
So we just rolled out our new kind of the highest level message, which is proceeded with confidence and, and that's been really effective for us, but we had to quickly pivot come up with that, get it out.

147
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:34,000
And so, you know, I would challenge folks to do the same and then last, the third pillar is execution.

148
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,700
We can control how well we execute, and we can control how efficiently we execute.

149
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,600
So I would say, you know, teams everywhere ours included are thinking about, you know where how do we eliminate waste?

150
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,500
You know, what are the things that we did last year?

151
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
That maybe weren't that great.

152
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Let us cut them and so and I have a lot more under that pillar but you know, those are three things.

153
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,100
I see p message and execution, that's what we can control, hmm.

154
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,000
That's good.

155
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
That's that those are right on.

156
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:16,900
When it comes to buying behavior and patterns going into 2023, what are some observations that you have about those patterns?

157
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,100
How will they shift as companies?

158
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,200
Decrease, their budgets and Workforce.

159
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,500
I can take this one and then I will throw it to you.

160
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:36,600
So a couple things one we are seeing its harder so just know it's harder, right?

161
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,100
Let us not expect it to be the same, right?

162
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:46,000
And, and so, when I say it's harder, and I am sure Amanda has probably more broad data on this, but this is just my own data.

163
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,200
So we look at every single deal that we won in the previous quarter.

164
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,900
And then we just look at all the patterns.

165
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,300
How many contacts do we need engaged?

166
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,600
And how many activities did we need to get from one stage to the next just raw math?

167
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:07,800
And we when we look at our raw math and I bet everyone is feeling this, it's more people engaged and it's more steps per stage.

168
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:15,000
So, just like when you go to the grocery store, your salary, doesn't go as far we're experiencing inflation.

169
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,200
And that, you know, it's, it takes more work to get a deal done.

170
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:29,200
And so, I think we need to understand that and how we collaborate across Teams to scale up our efforts and address that kind of call.

171
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,600
I would call it by, you know, deal inflation.

172
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:54,300
The other thing I would say is there are going to be probably fewer deals and so if you aren't Savvy about capturing signal like Now's the Time because you can't afford to miss out on deals right now and you can't afford to not be relevant, you're going to have to be all over the deals that are in.

173
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,000
It and make sure that you're highly relevant.

174
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,800
And so, and there're all kinds, there's always new forms of intent data.

175
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,400
You know, we're talking a lot about pre intent data.

176
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:16,700
So understanding tangential, buying patterns, understanding hiring patterns, understanding job, posting patterns, you know, all of these things help you understand, you know, is a company growing, are they investing where they invest?

177
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,300
Does it look like they have a problem?

178
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:31,200
And then, of course, the classic kind of, you know, first party and third T and then you know some of the things that like Amanda and G2 does like someone's researching you and your competition and you don't know about it.

179
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,900
That's kind of bad that's irresponsible.

180
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:40,300
I think right now given there are going to be less potential opportunities to go after.

181
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,200
I think I am just going to Echo a lot of what Latin he's that?

182
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,600
I mean, in the research report, that's linked here we did.

183
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Ask buyers, you know, how many stages are there?

184
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,000
How long is it taking you to do deals?

185
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,300
How many people are involved?

186
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:12,900
The thing that stood out to me the most in that part of the study was that eighty percent of buyers said we make consensus-based decisions, which is terrifying, right?

187
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,100
Because your Having a conversation, you think you know who the decision maker is and the reality?

188
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,400
Yes.

189
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:27,600
As a seller that's incredibly hard and so you know, ICP matters more than ever be really focused, but it's not just who do you think is the decision maker?

190
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:40,300
It's who's going to be part of that decision because the reality is to see if I was probably part of that decision, you know there's going to be people from maybe depending on if you're Marty Goetz sales and marketing sitting at the table making that decision.

191
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:51,600
And so your job as a marketer is to also think about Who is our kind of core ICP and then the decision-making set around that and what is the message we need to bring to those parties?

192
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,800
So that when they're at the table making that decision, they're all aligned on why they should choose you.

193
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,300
And so, that does make the deals harder.

194
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:05,900
Because it's more complex for buyers to make decisions and more complex for us to Market and sell to those decision-makers.

195
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:13,500
And then the other thing that we're seeing is there is going to be, there are going to be fewer deals and your and there are going to be fewer deals that result in any sort of lot.

196
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,900
People are research mode.

197
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,400
Yeah, so it doesn't want to be able to look for mazing.

198
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Yes, and I am conversion, rates are low and so, to lambie's point, really understanding within your own data set, what is within our control here?

199
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,000
Can we incentivize deals to close faster this year?

200
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,900
Can we keep really be clear about when a deal is probably just in research mode?

201
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,000
How do you keep them warm?

202
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But then not overtax your sales and marketing resources on deals that aren't going to maybe Because they're not ready to make the deal.

203
00:19:46,000 --> 00:20:01,300
So I think just getting really Savvy on who is the buying committee and then within deals being savvier about how do we get more of them to close and be smarter about knowing which ones maybe aren't going close knowing that again fewer deals to be had top of funnel.

204
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,800
May look great, but we all know it's not converting as well.

205
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:12,100
Yeah, I want to double down on one of your points and actually introduced a term that I find marketers aren't as familiar with.

206
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:21,500
But There's a term in sales called multi-threading and if you're in marketing, it's a it's an important concept to understand.

207
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,700
So right now, there's a forecast call happening somewhere in the world.

208
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,800
Probably many.

209
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:33,000
And some poor AE is getting in big-time trouble because his deal is not multi-threaded.

210
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,100
He's only talking to one person, or she there, and they're only talking to one person.

211
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:53,900
And the sales manager is saying, there's no way that's going close and you can say, that's not my problem, but it is our problem as marketers, and we and actually the longer a deal progresses the harder, it is to multi-thread.

212
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,600
So what does that mean for you?

213
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,900
And me as marketers we can start multi-threading much earlier than typically we do.

214
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:10,200
And that's one of my challenges with passing a quote-unquote lead because a lead is a single contact.

215
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,600
And that's a single-threaded deal.

216
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,900
That's not good for sales.

217
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:25,100
So think start to think about your SLA is like, when an account comes inbound, why do you just follow up with the person who were requested a demo?

218
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:31,700
If you're buying teams, 810 people, you probably should try to get at least three or four meetings right then and there, right?

219
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:39,900
And so three think you're SLA s with both your intent-based leads and your just classic inbound funnel.

220
00:21:40,100 --> 00:22:07,100
If you are B2B and you're seeing this contact thing and like you can be a force multiplier to the selling cycle, by having multi-thread plays early, and then even as the deal advances, Is there any advice you have on like the number of contacts that marketing could be warming up for sales?

221
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,500
You know, how is there a good number that strategically?

222
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,800
You know when we die Lander?

223
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,200
ICP, here're the companies.

224
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,400
How what do you recommend there?

225
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:27,000
I mean we have landed on three or four because if you look at you know what used to be six for us is now 13.

226
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:41,500
So you know and you want to be clear about whom those key personas are and then that could mean changes to comp plans for you know some of your Frontline roles like mdrs like SDR.

227
00:22:41,500 --> 00:23:01,900
So you do want to be clear about these are the personas that qualify for LT thread but, but, you know, me, we put out a CFO ebook recently and are promoting that just as, you know, are cover because guess what, a CFO or a finance business partner is going to be involved.

228
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,800
So we want them to understand what we do and the value prop we provide.

229
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,200
So things like that.

230
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:31,000
Yeah, I think there's the in multi-threading and marketing, you can do the proactive, you know, a Cover is Latin, he said, like be very clear on who is within that decision committee and where are you going to actually create messaging and plays targeted to them and the accounts you care about or a counselor showing intent and then one that is really enabling conversations within the organization.

231
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:55,100
So are there things that you can do one of the most successful plays I ever ran a multi-threading was actually creating conversations around topics that could bring those personas together sometimes across multiple accounts, not a selling conversation, just a relationship building Isolation that in this environment, maybe it is a great conversation to have, you know, the CFO, the head of marketing and the head of sales joining around table.

232
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,900
For example, with other peers, you can facilitate that in a way that helps, you understand and build those relationships.

233
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:11,600
And so there's that are cover within the broader ecosystem of accounts and then really doubling down on how do you create more relationship building experiences within the accounts that matter?

234
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,500
Most, especially if your you have longer deal Cycles, you have time to Do that.

235
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,700
But you have to be really proactive in which accounts need that kind of attention, hmmm.

236
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,500
So there's an interesting question.

237
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:29,600
That actually Spencer, Tucci is asking right now, I think is relevant to this how much time effort.

238
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,100
Do you spend your on the?

239
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,400
We put on stage, there you go.

240
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,700
How much time effort?

241
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,800
Do you spend marketing to secondary personas to enable, multi threading, compared to primary?

242
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,200
Is it more or less, or even split or something more, like, 70/30 percent?

243
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,400
Like how do you approach this when resources are thinner?

244
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,200
You know, we have got to be better.

245
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,100
Words of where we focus our time and our dollars.

246
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,200
So, it's interesting because I don't think that we have thought about it.

247
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:28,200
This way currently, but as I am looking at my future budget, I am going to start, I would say soft allocating program spend based on our key personas because what it's just like with anything you find that the ones that you know, and understand and have done before you, you continue to do more and more of and you know doing something new is always a new muscle.

248
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:49,700
So you know, we're going to be doing that and kind of have RV to Mom and some of our kpis, more tied to again, looking at our ICP and then within that IC PR, you know, are the best Persona fit, you know, we're finding that maybe we need to kind of force rotate to some other personas.

249
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,000
So I would say, look at your deal like, like, do the look back.

250
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:05,800
Look at One deals and look at the patterns and then that's how you determine the percentage for you, you know what's a winning pattern and how do you tap into winning patterns over and over again.

251
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,300
Yeah, I think that's right.

252
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,500
And I don't think it's going to look the same for every business because the weight of different personas in a deal cycle.

253
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,100
May be different.

254
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:23,300
If it's, you know, for example if you're a CV is 10 grand to, you're probably not going to over index on the CFO as much as if your deals six-figure +, right.

255
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:38,200
So, you know, I think the it's multi-threading is going to be pretty important, no matter what you're selling and to whom, but I think how important the various personas are Depends greatly on your product, your personas and Then, of course you're a CD.

256
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,900
Makes sense.

257
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
We got another multi-threading question here from Eric.

258
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
We have opened think I do?

259
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Can I know it's a good topic is with multi-threading increasing more and more?

260
00:26:52,800 --> 00:27:02,700
Do you believe it would be beneficial to try and reach advisors to that company as well, to create more relationships and take it a step deeper on pain and priorities?

261
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Well, you learn in Seattle's gravity, only goes one way.

262
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,700
So yeah.

263
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,600
I mean, if and I think when you say advisors you probably mean like board and that level.

264
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:25,300
So yeah, if you gravity goes one way, so I would say the higher, you can get and the higher you can get introduced, obviously the better.

265
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,800
Yeah, I agree with that.

266
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,900
That I would depend on your interpretation of advisors but assuming you're talking about board then.

267
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,800
Yes, awesome.

268
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:46,500
So going back to I know you kind of went into a little bit of squid squirrel here with multi-threading but it's such a solid strategy.

269
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,300
So, thank you for bringing that up.

270
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:56,300
We do have a question here from Alina and you know, it's going back up to sort of the metrics and how it what we're presenting.

271
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,300
Ink on a quarterly basis from your perspective, we're going into 2023.

272
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,500
How should we look at metrics and what do you advise in?

273
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:06,800
How?

274
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,900
We present a not just to the board?

275
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,500
I would ask.

276
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:21,800
But also to your leadership and to your team and to your organization, there're multiple tiers, there of communicating this Well, I know a lot knee has a great answer for this one.

277
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,700
I would say, I we do a couple of things.

278
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,400
So we also use the framework lightning reference, which is the V2 mom framework to set our goals.

279
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:37,600
If you do is you're familiar with okrs it's similar it's just a different acronym and approach but similar end result.

280
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,400
And so we have primary kpis that I actually put into sort of scoreboard for marketing.

281
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,800
And the first thing I do is you want to be Abel.

282
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,500
So they're not seeing different things from are getting every quarter because then it's like, well, what are you really focused on?

283
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,400
So at the beginning of the year, we set our scoreboard, we're repeating that every quarter, and we're reporting out on our metrics.

284
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:10,100
And I always make sure, of course, everyone cares about pipeline, but I always make sure it also includes other metrics, even if the board's, maybe not keep it up in mind.

285
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,500
So we always have a brand metrics.

286
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:30,500
So what are we really trying to achieve for our brand and for positioning so that we're balancing short and long-term even in this climate that Really important especially in this climate because a lot of people won't do that and if you invest in your brand now you will come out better later and then I actually include an efficiency metric because even if they don't ask, they're thinking about it.

287
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:37,900
And I am so glad that we do that because now in this climate, if someone says, how are you looking at the efficiency of what marketing is spending will?

288
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,300
We have had an answer for a while, and we have that as part of our scoreboard.

289
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:47,400
And, so I think just thinking about what are the things that you need to do to solve the businesses goals.

290
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:59,600
Goals, and what can you achieve as a team, and then putting that into something that, you know, makes it clear the value you deliver across the business and then making sure you're showing yourselves as good stewards of the business as part of that.

291
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,200
So, we actually have, you know what?

292
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,700
We call an efficiency metric and there's a whole methodology behind it, we reported a recorder.

293
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,500
So I would say so similar.

294
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,200
So yes.

295
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:22,200
And, and the way I think about V2, mom versus my dashboard is because we use V2.

296
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,400
Mom to those are the kpi.

297
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,500
Those are the things we're doing to change and evolve the business.

298
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:41,900
And so those have an Associated group of kpis and then there's what we're doing to like run the business and sort of report on the health of our Pipeline, and I am You know, pretty opinionated about how we do that.

299
00:30:41,900 --> 00:31:07,200
Here, we create essentially pipeline quotas and so, it's marketing's responsibility to not necessarily owned all of pipeline creation, but be the stewards of measuring all of pipeline creation and be the stewards of indicating how we're doing against the plan and so, you know, it's pretty simple.

300
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,900
I look at you know for top of fun.

301
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,900
Do I look at ICP website traffic?

302
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,500
So are we getting the right contacts and accounts to our website at an increasing basis?

303
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,800
You know, pretty simple.

304
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,400
We have the concept of tier one account, so I look at penetration of Tier 1 accounts.

305
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:34,000
That's another good kind of top of funnel Focus metric and then you know deals don't happen without meetings.

306
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,900
So we track meetings and how those meetings.

307
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Grass and then stage two for us, which is Pipeline.

308
00:31:42,800 --> 00:32:00,000
And the interesting thing about it is we're looking at like raw created Pipeline, and we look by segment by Channel, and then we're always tracking win rates conversions and asps because that's what you used to come up with how much pipeline you need to create.

309
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:15,000
And so, what I love about the dashboard is it has pipelined, created count and dollar but then right next to it has the ASP cycle times and win rates that we assumed and it goes, right?

310
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,300
And if we assumed a 40% win rate and oh by the way, we're at a 35% win rate.

311
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
That's a problem.

312
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,600
So those red.

313
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,900
So we know, okay, we need to do something about this or if the cycle time show slows down, right?

314
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:38,700
So it keeps that check and balance of us, not just creating a ton of Pipeline and feeling super happy.

315
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:50,900
That Create a pipeline in it and it's not progressing or something like that or and it and also allows us to drill down by go to market segment, because sometimes, you can look good holistically.

316
00:32:51,100 --> 00:33:00,500
But then you can start to drill in, and you see, oh, well, actually, the commercial segment is, is not hitting their pipeline numbers and Strat had a great month.

317
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,900
And they had all these big lumpy things come in and that masked like this other.

318
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:15,200
So you have to like really drill in and be looking at it on kind of That basis to keep the pace healthy.

319
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,800
And that's a big priority for us.

320
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,500
It's the best way to future-proof.

321
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,500
Your bookings are future proof your pipeline, so that's kind of how we think about it.

322
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:59,100
And then I would say yes and on efficiency, we have kind of version of almost a CAC, and it's sort of like, what we spent a couple quarters ago versus the pipeline we created this quarter and you know, there's no perfect metric but the faster you get to something that is Trackable and everyone understands and trendabl the better, and then we do like basic Roi for any big program or big chunk of spend.

323
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,400
We're going to be looking for at least a 10 times Roi on that.

324
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:08,000
So and we stack rank every quarter with a qvr how we progress against those?

325
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,800
So some of the ways we kind of measure so good, thank you for breaking that all down.

326
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,500
I feel like I need to re-watch these segments and captured some detailed notes here, you know.

327
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:29,000
It gets me thinking about then, okay, in order to be successful, obviously we need to work as a team across all go to market.

328
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:37,500
And I know both of you talk a lot about sales and marketing alignment and even customer success alignment going into 2023.

329
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:52,699
And actually, Spencer asked another question that sort of aligned to this, you know, he's an Asking here what does sales and marketing really need to get aligned on in 2023 in order to be successful in all these strategies and different things that you're bringing up?

330
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,199
Like what does that look like?

331
00:34:54,199 --> 00:35:01,100
And I would also include customer success into that and I know customer marketing is another topic that we're going to tackle a little bit.

332
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,200
But what's what are your thoughts to that alignment?

333
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,400
So we talked about functional metrics which is great.

334
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:27,800
You have to have a bead on your functional metrics, but I think also just good financial literacy and alignment on the highest level metrics and in assurance that the whole team understands that.

335
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:36,400
So we talked about efficiency sales and marketing share of wallet, and ultimately a board is going to be looking at kak.

336
00:35:36,700 --> 00:36:18,100
So we can be the most efficient little beans but if you know were doing crazy stuff on sale sales it's just not going to work and vice versa and so you know things like gross retention, net retention, you know, are per employee like there's just a lot of kind of like overarching things that like indicate the health of us a specific, your SAS company, which we are indicated that and I think just making sure that It everybody on the team has Financial like literacy around those and how every single, you know, we're all like cells in the big organism, right?

337
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,400
And we all can contribute to those.

338
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And so, I think keeping those top of mind, so you don't get to myopic in your own functional metrics.

339
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,600
Yeah, I think that's right.

340
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:39,200
We were actually I was just having a conversation with my team about this about sort of like, let us talk holistically about next year and not marketing or sales but just like holistically across the business.

341
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,300
What do we need to achieve?

342
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,600
And I think taking that down to like what is sales and marketing have to get aligned on the first one is that?

343
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,800
Where is growth going to come from next year?

344
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:54,400
And then if your plan looks the same, your Revenue plan, your sales plan, your marketing plan.

345
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,800
Next year, you're probably not making enough big changes.

346
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,200
Not that you have to make totally radical swings by like next year's probably gonna look different.

347
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,900
Your plans should probably look different.

348
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,000
So what we have done is we have said, okay, what do we need to achieve next year?

349
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,400
How is that going to be different?

350
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,000
And then what is the role of sales and marketing to do that?

351
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,500
So what is the role of sales versus Marketing in driving nrr?

352
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,700
And we want to have a really collaborative relationship in a world of abundance.

353
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,500
Where we came from, we could all just go.

354
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:34,200
Go against all the metrics that the Game time together really fast in a world where the board is looking at Blended sales and marketing efficiency.

355
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:39,900
Well, what can I do to have a more collaborative relationship, and so we're not duplicating efforts?

356
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:45,000
How can we best support each other in the most efficient way possible and you might make different choices?

357
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,500
So I think that's a really important one is what do you need to achieve for the business?

358
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:57,900
And then what is the handshake role and relationship for sales or CS forces marketing to achieve those kpis?

359
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Is going into next year, and we actually do that by segment and by metrics so that we understand like on Enterprise.

360
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
For example, what's the role of marketing versus sales?

361
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,200
And then when there is you know what's the role of this?

362
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Yes team as well.

363
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,300
So that's really clear.

364
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Here's the top line of what we need to do in the segment and then here's what each team and function what we need to do and deliver.

365
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:28,900
Is there a recommended Cadence like howdy just practically speaking like on a week-to-week monthly?

366
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:36,200
Like what's the Cadence of that alignment that takes place in communication and meetings because we don't want more meetings.

367
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,800
We want to work asynchronously as well.

368
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,100
But like how does that look in each of your organization's?

369
00:38:43,200 --> 00:39:01,000
I mean, I think for us, we plan we do annual plans, we revisit every half, and then we have got a pretty tight alignment on a monthly basis with our sales leadership, including at the segment level to see how is what we are.

370
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:10,900
Delivering performing so that we can iterate along the way I would say you probably can't you can over plan in this climate but you can't communicate enough.

371
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,800
Like I don't think there's such a thing as too much.

372
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,100
Munication in this climate because things are changing, its really unpredictable.

373
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:25,700
So the more conversations you can have to make sure that everybody has the same shared information on how we're performing and what's trending in the market the better.

374
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:38,700
So if you're not doing that at least monthly you know you probably need to think about increasing that frequency across sales and marketing line am curious what you all do from up from a planning and Alignment.

375
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,300
Cadence.

376
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,900
Yeah, well, our exec team, we meet for two hours.

377
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,700
Every Week.

378
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:51,600
So that's sort of standing, you know, huddle, and we cover all kinds of topics.

379
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:56,100
Obviously, you know, it's funny.

380
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,500
I wish I could give a better answer because there's a lot of things that we do.

381
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:07,200
There're meetings, that we have, there're dashboards, there's this, there's, there's Monday reports that go out.

382
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,100
I mean, we have all of those things, but I call it getting in the flow.

383
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:32,400
And Anna and it's a little more organic but I just think that there's like knowing when you're in the flow with someone and when you're not and to me like being in the flow is like the I have got 10 minutes before a flight.

384
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,900
I am just going to call you and see what's going on, you know?

385
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:56,700
And, and I know that sounds but I think sometimes we almost over engineer and then almost I don't have his real conversations, whereas, Sometimes just a little text here there or a quick, you know, 15 minute, I am waiting in carpool.

386
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,200
What's shakin bacon?

387
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
Helps with that.

388
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:01,800
I don't know.

389
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,300
Flow.

390
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:10,500
Anyway again, I don't think that's the answer people want but that's what, but I think you're hitting something Latin, especially moving into next year.

391
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,200
You know, I think what you're hitting is trust.

392
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:25,700
I think in flow can happen when you have this the trust amongst your key colleagues that you're running in the trenches with and it's like how do you get there?

393
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,000
You know if rather than falling default to our Templates.

394
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,800
And okay.

395
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:39,500
We have got this meeting, Cadence sometimes there's core things that we need to address, but it requires that level of trust and communication to get there.

396
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,400
So what have both of you done to get to flow?

397
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,100
Because I think that is a very powerful note.

398
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,600
I think sometimes like putting down the agendas in the slides like to build off that.

399
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:05,800
Like so we have pipeline meetings every month and there's the slot, you know, the dashboards and the slides and the whatever and all the Rev world leaders are there and marketing's there.

400
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:12,300
And one of our last meetings I was like, let us just I read the pre-raid, can we just like put that aside?

401
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,300
Can we just talk about what's happening in the business?

402
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,200
And like what's it?

403
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,500
And we had the conversation on what's within our control.

404
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:30,300
And so we started looking at The metrics, you're like, okay, what's within our control and it was a very helpful conversation, but we just sort of like it was sort of like just we're doing all the things.

405
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,000
Can we just pause for a minute and just have some real talk about?

406
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,300
What do you think's happening?

407
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,800
Just intuitively, we have informed ourselves.

408
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,300
What do we think is within our control?

409
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,900
So I think it's a really important thing about building trust but also trusting yourself.

410
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:50,400
There is going to be very little certainty including in all of your data in the first table.

411
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,000
Future things.

412
00:42:51,100 --> 00:43:01,600
Are going to be wonky and you're gonna be like, I don't know why top of funnel looks great, but bottom of the funnel conversions are lower and I think just trusting your own intuition and form yourself and then trust your intuition.

413
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:10,300
And have real talk with your team's is it is pretty powerful and so that's resonating what Latin he said and what you said, you know, with me as well.

414
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,100
Love that.

415
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:25,400
Okay, I am gonna pull us back up into some other questions that are popping up here and I would love to tackle customer marketing as well looking at time.

416
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,900
Alina's got a question here on okrs and structure.

417
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:38,900
So as we're talking, still about teams and how you all do things within each of your orgs, how do you structure Okie ours, specifically for your marketing team?

418
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:54,200
So I am a V2, mom Enthusiast for the record, but we also do, okay, ours and so.

419
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,200
Okay, ours to me or more bottom up.

420
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:05,200
V2, mom is more top-down and you need both, but they calf they can't connect.

421
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:24,800
And so what we do is we have the company V2, mom, that comes out at the beginning of the year and then gets a refresh, you know, in the middle of the year and then I develop off vibing off of the company, won the marketing lie to Mom.

422
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,500
For our artwork and then individuals, do okay, ours.

423
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:39,500
But I ask that the okay are has one objective, no more than 31 objective.

424
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:47,100
That's tied to the overall, the overall kind of V2, mom, marketing, and or company.

425
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:55,600
But the whatever the top priorities are from the company, s is a functional thing, something they're going to, you know, tied to their overall functional goals.

426
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,000
Then third is personal but no more than that.

427
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,900
And then we do a check in on those every quarter.

428
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,200
But I think you can kind of over do it.

429
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:16,800
If you get to I mean, so much of being a good manager, is just consistently having a one-on-one with people.

430
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,800
So we do, we do almost the exact same thing.

431
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,400
So we have the company V2, mom's published at the end of the year.

432
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,500
We do a mid-year kind of refresh of that.

433
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:36,100
Based on what's changed the market, we have a marketing one that fives off the company, one, and then for ours, we have key.

434
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,200
I have key leaders who own what's called a method.

435
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,900
So I see Spencer here sharing it.

436
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,400
So each of my L will own at least one method.

437
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And then they're accountable for the cross-functional work required to make that method, come to life and to happen and to hit the metric associated with it.

438
00:45:53,300 --> 00:46:00,700
And then we do individual V2 moms as well that we pair with what's called a performance development plan which is here's what I am going to achieve for the company.

439
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:08,100
And here's what I want to achieve in my career and sometimes those are very much correlated and sometimes the career ones are longer term, and we check it.

440
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,100
We do those quarterly as well, but they're two different documents.

441
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:22,000
One, sort of the Personally to Mom and one is the personal development plan, it's called a PDP, not to be confused with a pip which is where acronyms can go really South.

442
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:32,100
That's good clarification, awesome and thanks caver, eccentric, a break for dropping in the V2.

443
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,500
Mom framework, right there.

444
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:35,900
That's great.

445
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:48,000
Here's another question coming up about the structure of your teams and within each of your orgs is coming up from a Lena, how do you structure your team or so moving into 2023?

446
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,800
How are you looking at structuring?

447
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,100
Your team to support the goals that you have all identified?

448
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:57,500
Amanda.

449
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,900
You want to take this one for sure.

450
00:46:59,700 --> 00:46:59,900
Well.

451
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:18,700
So G to my org looks a little different, and she too because of the nature of our business, but I have kind of traditional ask structure and then I have a Brandon Communications function which is really responsible for our story but also includes things like events that really Naturally Fit within the skill.

452
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,500
Set of that team.

453
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,800
They have a creative function, which supports a lot of our organization.

454
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,900
I have product partner and Summer marketing actually together.

455
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:40,500
And that's really nice because it helps us I think tell a better narrative around our products but more importantly, even the value that we're delivering to our customers and that they're getting from the products.

456
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And then I have a, I have an interesting organ, it's our user lifecycle and Community organization, which is really focused on the buyer, side of g 2.

457
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,700
So how do we get more people coming to G2 to search for software and to leave reviews for software?

458
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,400
Providers.

459
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:05,200
And so that's a function and actually, it includes support as well, which is a bit unusual for a marketing team, and they're all focused.

460
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:11,200
We have got 80 million buyers who come to G to it and growing, and so they're a big part of that.

461
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:26,100
And then we have a revenue marketing function which is in a very important function that also includes our marketing operations and Tech stack, which is near and dear to my heart are a great team and the mar Tech stack is pretty core to everything we do at G2.

462
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,200
So, That's kind of the core functions.

463
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,300
We have it in marketing.

464
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:45,300
I would say similar, we have competitive intelligence under pmm, but customer is also under pmm and partner.

465
00:48:46,200 --> 00:49:00,200
We have a separate ABX team which for us, is just a, it's all of our experiential marketing which we do a lot of and a lot of like high-touch campaigns and things like that.

466
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,200
At, and they're their own team.

467
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,400
But other than that, yeah, I was a pretty standard.

468
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:09,700
That's great.

469
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:17,500
Well, I do want to pull the thread into customer marketing because this is a topic that has been coming up a lot.

470
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:30,300
And, you know, moving into next year investing into existing customers focusing on retention and expansion is a no-brainer and a big priority, you know, there're many ways.

471
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,600
Ways to go about to do this, aside from getting G2 reviews from customers, holding an advisory boards.

472
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,500
What does customer marketing look like?

473
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:45,100
What does that look like for each of you and where does the budget headcount come from?

474
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:51,700
Because it's not quite a fully fleshed-out, you know, maybe it is for you all, but I think I know right now.

475
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,600
There's a lot of folks still trying to figure out what does that look like?

476
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,700
What is the ROI?

477
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,900
And attribution look like with customer marketing.

478
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:00,400
Yeah.

479
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:16,600
Well, I think it starts with how do you define customer marketing and I can get on a soapbox about this but I think it's one of the most critical functions and also one of the most multi-faceted if you define it in a really strategic way which is not often defined in a very strategic way.

480
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,800
To me, it's incredibly strategic.

481
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:29,300
What you think about customer marketing is the function that both it's sort of Yin and Yang helps you grow with your existing customers and also leverages your existing customers to grow with new ones to me.

482
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,300
That becomes a really strategic function within the organization.

483
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,500
Like, it's not references and reviews.

484
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:40,800
It's actually, how do we grow our existing customer base and turn them into Advocates that can help us attract new customers?

485
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,200
That's a strategic customer marketing function.

486
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:56,900
And so for us, that's how we have defined it, and we have a couple of pillars under that are really important but one of the most important ones for us right now is customer education but for Us customer education, starts presale.

487
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:08,000
So we don't gate our customer education for like when you become a customer because we know that buyers want to understand how they're going to be successful and using the product while before the sale.

488
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:17,700
And so we spend a lot of time thinking about what's the right training and education for our customers, including presale and how do we carry that through?

489
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,600
And then certainly advocacy is the second pillar.

490
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,700
How do we actually build customer Advocates and have them?

491
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,400
Share the stories of how G2 is impacting their own?

492
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,900
And growth.

493
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,800
And then expansion is sort of the third pillar.

494
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:38,300
And how do we actually make sure we're growing our customer relationships and really strategic ways, especially for our larger accounts?

495
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:50,900
So those kind of how we have defined it, it's a really big and important function, but it can often be like, well, we have someone who does references reviews, which isn't a bad thing, you want that, but I think there's so much more to it than that.

496
00:51:53,700 --> 00:52:09,300
So we I would say one of the things that we do is customer and Community is one group, and they really go hand-in-hand, and so we very early on at six cents.

497
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:15,100
Realized we don't really sell software, we sell change.

498
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:23,600
And a change in approach that is, is more efficient and has all these great benefits, but requires a change.

499
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:28,600
And so we decided, we need to support.

500
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,700
We probably need to provide support other than just how to set it up in the software, right?

501
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:40,800
Like it's a mentality, the measurement around it, the process around it, the organizational structure.

502
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:47,100
So very early on, we decided we were going to invest be And communities.

503
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:51,100
And so, that's a huge part of our customer marketing.

504
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:55,200
It's about, you know, how do we make sure that they are engaged, right?

505
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:07,800
You think about Employee Engagement, we think about customer engagement and, you know, we measure things like, we want to make sure that ninety percent of our customers show up every quarter.

506
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:14,100
Like if no one is coming to learn about our new roadmap from an account there.

507
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,400
Probably read.

508
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:15,900
They don't.

509
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,200
Care you, right?

510
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,900
And so it's like, people vote with their feet, and so we do a lot around keeping customers engaged.

511
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,200
Keeping them, you know, we're innovating fast.

512
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,200
And so we want to, we want to also address them in their whole role.

513
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,600
Not just what they do with six Ed's, right?

514
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:40,700
So I want people to say six cents, made me successful in my role and my kpis, but also my overall career.

515
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,900
So we take, I would say a very broad approach for customers.

516
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:52,200
Getting, you know, the funding of it is, is interesting.

517
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:58,700
It's sort of like you for me, you sort of, don't ask and you just do and then it's amazing.

518
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:04,800
And of course people want to fund it but not everyone has that luxury, especially right now.

519
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,900
So I get that.

520
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:25,700
But I would say going back to some of those important metrics like nrr and gross retention and you know, No, we think a lot about adopted use cases and so, you know, how are we helping get more adopted use cases?

521
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:29,000
So that's that is like a score that we look at.

522
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,400
So yeah, it's a much more I think holistic.

523
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:41,600
It can have a lot more value than people, I think perceived in the past.

524
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,300
But it does require the right level of investment, right?

525
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:51,000
I mean, we said oh, it's It just reviews and it's not just references in case studies, but that's a lot of work.

526
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,300
Justin just that's still a lot of work.

527
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,600
It really is and I know and you know, requires investment of a different kind.

528
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,000
So yeah.

529
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:14,200
But I think again you know, when you think about the cost of losing a customer and you think about LTV and like again great SAS metrics, they come down to retention and growth.

530
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:19,000
So just making sure you're tying that function back to those.

531
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,200
Yeah.

532
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,300
And I do want to say like, The reference is a reviews, it's really the foundation.

533
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,400
Like if you don't have customers that are willing to Advocate, right?

534
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:32,300
And there's no real Community, it's going to be a community of complainers.

535
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,300
You're going to be screwed.

536
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,200
Yeah.

537
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:42,000
And it gives you those hand-raisers who you can see like are we ready to build and kind of create our own connection and who should we invite?

538
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,700
But yeah, you want to make sure you have got people who are willing to come to the dance before you put on.

539
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,100
Don't put on the party, they don't it's going to come to.

540
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,700
So those are pretty critical at the foundation of God.

541
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,400
Marketing.

542
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,400
I love that.

543
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,200
You said budget to.

544
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,100
I feel like, if you ask a CMO, what do you have?

545
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:05,000
Budgeted for Pipeline and acquisition, they will be like, I know exactly my number next year and I fought with my CFO about it and if you ask them like, what did you budget for customer marketing?

546
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:13,700
That's a much harder question but I think a really good one to ask heading into next year and just try honestly just tracking upsell pipeline.

547
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:21,600
Again, if you take this holistic pipeline model, I can flip back and forth and a second between net new and upsell pipeline.

548
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:34,200
And if we now and then going back to the financial plan, if we know that this year, we have agreed of higher percentage of our Pipeline and bookings is going to come from expansion or cross-sell.

549
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,300
Then, you know, there you go, then you sort of have your metric.

550
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,000
But anyway, so that's also another way to look at it.

551
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,000
So good I can't believe it.

552
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,800
We only have five minutes left time just flew, and we have some questions here.

553
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,500
You know, looking at all these, I would love to ask this last question.

554
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,900
I know there's some technical questions, Leo.

555
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,200
Chris you guys are asking some technical questions will reply back to you after this event.

556
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:10,400
But in this event right now as we're wrapping up, I want to bring up Christine colosimo's, question.

557
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,100
Oops, sorry Sal could actually hit the button.

558
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,200
He's our producer.

559
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:27,700
Maybe you can pull it back up, but she was asking basically how do we keep our team's motivated in times like this when budgets are smaller efficiency?

560
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,400
Super important headcount is harder to come by.

561
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,600
How are you inspiring the teams?

562
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:43,400
It's probably the thing I worry the most about And Amanda and I were at dinner last night talking about this.

563
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:54,000
Like you know a no-brainer is getting people together but that's also expensive, right, looks like, right?

564
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,300
So it's like, It's hard.

565
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:04,200
We're going to have to it's like covid part 2, right of being creative, especially with us.

566
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:19,500
You know, embracing hybrid, you know, work environments and I think that I have decided I wrote in prep for this like You know, this whole does more with less is just b*******.

567
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,200
Like that's not inspiring to anybody.

568
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:34,400
So I think what we have to do is really commit to We have to fundamentally change the way we work and that either comes from better focus.

569
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:49,200
It comes from tapping into things like, Automation and AI for scale and then I think it comes from eliminating complexity because complexity comes at a cost.

570
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:59,100
And, you know, when you're in a high growth environment, you can just add a dad and sometimes you just need to peel it back and be like, wait why are we doing that?

571
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:04,700
Like, you know, and so But it, I don't know.

572
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:10,900
I would love suggestions for what, what people think work, I mean, I can't do another virtual wine tasting.

573
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,000
I know that, you know, it's okay.

574
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,700
We had to, I mean, I don't know.

575
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,600
I think so.

576
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,500
A couple things I have three.

577
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:20,900
I don't.

578
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,400
First of all, this is a journey.

579
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,900
I think for everybody, our team included, but I think the first is people can't feel motivated.

580
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:31,800
When they don't understand and know, and trust the people they work with and you don't have to do that in person.

581
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:39,600
It helps But we just do a chat every month, and it's just, there's no agenda.

582
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,200
There is no, we did the wine tasting.

583
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:56,900
It's just like just show up, and we're going to talk, and we often have themes that are like real, and we find ways to kind of connect as people because it's hard to just be work people all the time through resumes green.

584
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:02,900
So that's the first thing is get to know each other as people, because it's, you're going to be more motivated when you're working.

585
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,500
And supporting people, you really know.

586
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:16,700
And trust the second thing we do is find the creativity in it, which is easier said than done, but there's always peopled on this like, I am one of those people that's like, who doing more or less have fun.

587
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,000
Like, I know, I am a rarity right.

588
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,700
Like, I am like, oh, that sounds really exciting, but there are ways to find the fun and creativity on it.

589
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:28,200
And so, I think just saying like what can be what if this was fun?

590
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:37,500
Like what would have to be the conditions in which this would be enjoyable for us and it might mean, I mean, what we need to do less stuff because otherwise, it's just overwhelming and can we prioritize better?

591
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,700
And it may also look like efficiency and optimization and finding new levers to pull this fun because we can test and experiment and that's fun.

592
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,500
And I think the third thing is just like being transparent.

593
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,400
It gets really hard to stay motivated if you think there's something behind the curtain.

594
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:56,900
And, so I think it's m like the more you can be just transparent on what you know and what you don't know.

595
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:02,000
Because there's a lot, we don't know and won't be I think super important.

596
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:08,300
Wow, thank you your time so much Latin e Amanda.

597
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:14,800
It's been a pleasure to have you here, and drop your wisdom and insights for all of us.

598
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,900
Thank you so much for taking the time.

599
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:26,900
We actually, I just want to communicate as a B2B marketer were so inspired and grateful for both of you as we know that you have invested so much into us.

Thank you for sitting in and joining the conversation.

604
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,900
We will be sending this recording out to you all.

605
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:50,200
Oh it looks like hey the first 102 registered will receive Latin.

606
01:01:50,200 --> 01:02:04,500
He's book we have another event tomorrow with Nick Bennett who is the director of evangelism and customer marketing with Alice, and we're going to go deeper into evangelism and Customer marketing and pull that thread.

607
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:10,300
All right, so for that with all that have a wonderful rest of your day, we hope to see you tomorrow.

608
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,900
If we don't have a wonderful rest of your week, stay positive.

609
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,100
Keep the joy.

610
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,100
You got this, we can do this.

611
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,200
All right, take care.

612
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:18,700
Bye.

613
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,900
So you are honor him.

614
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,300
I played my drum.

615
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:44,900
Put him back.

616
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:54,500
I played my best for him by a bumper, to bumper.

1
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,400
Wait and Oahu to be specific.

2
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,600
Ewa Beach and it's 10:47.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,300
A.m.

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,200
What time is it for you?

5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:35,900
It is 347 right now and I got to say it's pretty amazing that we're on opposite ends of the Earth basically, right?

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,800
And we're having a conversation here on welcome, it's kind of crazy when you think about it.

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,200
Just like sometimes when you think about technology, we tend to take it for granted but I think, I don't know.

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,800
Some comedian.

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,400
I heard on Late Show one time, and he was like, you know, isn't it kind of crazy?

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Like you're in an airplane you're in a like a metal cylinder, just flying through the air.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,200
It's a crazy concept.

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,100
Don't think about stuff like that.

13
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,200
We don't think in depth about that, you know, you kind of just like, oh yeah, it's just a bullet train.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:12,100
That's going 200 miles 42 mph when your machine gun send in Japan or in an airplane.

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,100
Yeah, totally.

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:13,700
So, yeah.

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,800
Being on, welcome and being able to connect in completely different time zones across the globe.

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,000
It's pretty awesome.

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:23,900
Yeah.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,700
For sure, it blows my mind sometimes.

21
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,700
Yeah.

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,300
Yeah.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,600
Talking about mind-blowing topics.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,600
I am really excited Jerry to be able to pick your Noggin.

25
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:51,100
You know, your big Noggins is like part of your friend, which I love, but really pick your brain on how you're observing the trends that are taking place in the economy, you know, feds recently, increase interest rates and all that kind of stuff.

26
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,200
Elon Musk, Twitter getting layoffs, layoffs, left, and right and Tech.

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,500
We're going to talk about those things.

28
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:09,600
But before we jump into some of those topics would love to learn a little bit more about just you and your background as a serial founding entrepreneur.

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,800
So can you like let us rewind, I think it's way back.

30
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,600
Like, like back the sure Blackstreet how far?

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,900
How far back do you want me to go?

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,400
When did you where were you born?

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,200
And then when did you migrate to the states?

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,500
Yes, I was born in fishing Village in China called Ningbo.

35
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,500
And when I say Village, it's a city of about 5 million people, right?

36
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,400
But that's basically what a village in China is these days.

37
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:50,300
So I was born there in the 80s and then I moved to the United States when I was 5 years old from there, I lived in Columbus, Ohio.

38
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:58,500
And then, I guess the first formative event in my life as it relates to, my career happened in the late 90s.

39
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,200
When my dad actually got a job in Silicon Valley, as part of the first.com, boom, and subsequent bust.

40
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,100
So, that's when I started to get interested in technology went to school in California.

41
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:19,500
In the Bay Area, went to college at Cal, graduated had my first job at Lockheed Martin, which is a defense contractor.

42
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,000
And that's where I also met Roberto.

43
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,900
My current co-founder here at welcome.

44
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:30,200
And I think ever since I was young Was interested in entrepreneurship.

45
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,200
I was interested in technology, and so I always wanted to start a company.

46
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,300
I always wanted to be at the Forefront of innovation and I made the leap.

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,700
When I saw Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone for the first time I was like, wow this is a pretty revolutionary piece of technology.

48
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:56,500
I was actually very amazed when he first unveiled in 2008, and my first company was an app company.

49
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,600
I made a fantasy Sports.

50
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:12,000
App for mobile phones later, I sold that to Yahoo and that's where Roberto and I work for a little while, so stay there for a couple of years and then Roberto and I decided to work together after that, as well.

51
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,300
He what?

52
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,600
That's where he met, you, I believe in Colorado, and I moved to Colorado at that point.

53
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,700
And we started welcome about two years ago so that's brings us too today.

54
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,300
Wow.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,100
And, you know, you just mentioned a See at, but that's actually like the fantasy football app that was sold to Yahoo right.

56
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,400
Huge.

57
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,700
That's right, there's fantasy football, but I also supported a bunch of other sports as well.

58
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,700
Like my personal favorite sport is basketball.

59
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,100
So I didn't play too much football played a lot of fantasy basketball though.

60
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,300
Very cool.

61
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,000
Wow.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,700
What a journey.

63
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,100
So, here you are today with welcome, you're one of three founders.

64
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,100
So it's you.

65
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,100
Roberto and tiger.

66
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,400
Who's your brother?

67
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:05,300
In fact, you have two other brothers and all of you are in Tech as well, right?

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,900
Yeah, I guess, you know, you know what they say the Apple doesn't fall far?

69
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,100
Fall far from the tree.

70
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,400
My dad was in technology and all three of his sons are also in technology.

71
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400
So maybe there's something to that, that's pretty awesome.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,400
Wow, cool.

73
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay so then now fast-forward to where we're at today and you know you're seeing how things are trending across the economy, across the globe From, as mentioned earlier, the feds raising interest rates to hopefully decrease the inflation that's taking place.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:57,900
But I would love to hear your perspective and thoughts of what you see from Jerry's lens with how the feds increase is going to effect?

75
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,600
You know, it's affecting all the economy and even affecting what we're seeing taking place across attack.

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,800
Yeah, you know it's interesting.

77
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,100
I started my first company after the last crash the last time.

78
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:17,200
The economy crashed was in 2008 and I started a company and 2009, right?

79
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:33,500
So, you know, I don't claim to be an economics expert at all but just for my own life experience, the Federal Reserve and the greater economy has a much larger impact on companies.

80
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,500
He success than we like to thank, right?

81
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:59,800
We often sort of get this idea in our heads and it's propagated by the media where if you just have a great idea and you execute well you're going to become rich, you know, your company is going to do well but really if you look throughout history, especially in technology and technology is not really that young being at the right place at the right time and understanding how the economy works and understanding how money works.

82
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,500
You know, really has a big impact I think on this.

83
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,900
Success of companies.

84
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,500
So yeah, you mentioned the federal the FED rates raising interest rates.

85
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,200
Now, we could go in a couple of directions here, right?

86
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,500
We could talk about, you know what that even means.

87
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Let us start with that.

88
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:18,900
What?

89
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,600
Interest rates.

90
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,500
Let us start there.

91
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,400
Yeah, yeah.

92
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,800
So Now, what do we started?

93
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:40,100
I think it's one of those things where, if you think about what money is at the end of the day, You come to the conclusion that money isn't really real, right?

94
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:49,500
A lot of this things like oh it's, you know, I want to make money, there're tons of money out there if somebody has money and I don't have money like, how do I get money, but what exactly is money, right?

95
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:56,000
Like its kind of interesting question to think about and that's where the FED comes in, right?

96
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,100
The FED while they can't print money that, that road belongs to the United States Treasury.

97
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,600
They can certainly influence the amount of Money that's out there in circulation.

98
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,400
Right?

99
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:20,600
So, the, the interest rate that set by the FED is the interest rate at which the Federal Reserve Bank lends out money to other Banks and that has a huge impact on the economy.

100
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:33,100
Because economic activity is composed of two things, is composed of the total amount of money that's in the market, but it's also composed of credit and there's a lot more credit out there than there is money.

101
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,700
Probably, by an order of magnitude, right?

102
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:52,600
So I mean I don't know the exact numbers but I think there's probably less say around three trillion dollars of just like cash like US dollars out there in the market and there's probably something on the order of 50 or 60 trillion dollars worth of credit out there on the market, right?

103
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,700
So for example, let us just think about your bank account, right?

104
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,800
You what do you use for your bank account to use like, Wells, Fargo or Bank of America?

105
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,000
Thanks.

106
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:11,400
Okay, okay so let us say you put ten dollars into Chase right now?

107
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Chase can take that ten dollars, and then they can lend it out to other people.

108
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,600
And they have, what is called a reserve requirement.

109
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:28,400
Which means they only need to keep 10% of the amount on their balance sheet in cash at any one time.

110
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:36,900
So if you put ten dollars into Chase Bank, they actually have a hundred dollars that they can use to lend out to other businesses.

111
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,800
Right engine.

112
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,900
So the majority of our economy is actually composed of this credit that Banks can lend out.

113
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:51,000
And the Federal Reserve is what's considered the lender of Last Resort, which means the banks, where do they go to get money?

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,100
They actually go to the Federal Reserve.

115
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:04,500
So when the Federal Reserve sets low interest rates, that means Banks can borrow money very easily, which in turn means you as a consumer can borrow money very easily.

116
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,000
So, let us say you want to buy a house, right?

117
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:14,000
You can get a low mortgage so you can afford that dream house and Oahu that you always wanted, right?

118
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,700
And the economy booms.

119
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:24,200
But then when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, then, you know, it's more expensive for banks to get money.

120
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,600
So it's more expensive for them to lend money to you.

121
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:36,100
So then economic activity tends to grind to a halt or slow down when the FED raises interest rates, which is what's happening today in the market.

122
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,600
Gotcha.

123
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,100
Okay, so let us even rewind, a few steps back.

124
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,900
Why are the feds even raising interest rates?

125
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:54,600
And I know I have heard about yeah like there's inflation taking place it's supposed to help decrease inflation.

126
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,400
But how do we even get to this point?

127
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,400
Yeah, very good question.

128
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,000
So interest rates have been very, very low for a long time.

129
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:11,800
In fact, from 2008, all the way, till the beginning of covid, interest rates were close to zero.

130
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,900
And that's because of the previous financial crisis.

131
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,600
So, back in 2008, the entire global economy basically melted down.

132
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:28,500
And so, in order to stimulate the economy, because remember, when the FED lowers interest rates is stimulates economic activity because there's more A borrowing, there's more lending.

133
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,000
There's more credit available for businesses and individuals.

134
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,000
And so from 2008 to 2020, it was good times, right?

135
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,300
Home prices went up, stocks went up, technology went up, because people were making more money.

136
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:52,200
They wanted to invest that money and often that money went into technology companies and even riskier assets, like, like crypto which we can talk about, right?

137
00:11:53,500 --> 00:12:08,200
And so covid-19, David hit, Really, the Federal Reserve went into overdrive, and they lowered rates all the way to zero the United States Treasury printed a lot of money.

138
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:19,000
In fact, I think the statistic is around forty percent of all US dollars, that have ever existed in history were printed during 2020 and 2021.

139
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,700
Wow.

140
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,100
Right.

141
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,100
So what happens when you print a lot of money?

142
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:32,300
Well, the money that's in your wallet becomes worth less because now there're more dollars out there and that's what triggers inflation?

143
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,500
So, to answer your question, simply the FED has to raise interest rates because inflation is going crazy.

144
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,400
I think the latest official numbers are nine to ten percent, but a lot of people think, due to the way that inflation is measured.

145
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,900
It's actually a lot higher than that.

146
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,200
So, the FED really has no choice.

147
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,900
But to raise interest rates to combat inflation, got it.

148
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What's what are?

149
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,700
You know, economists saying about how long interest rates will be kept this high?

150
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,300
Nobody really knows, right?

151
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:19,300
So I have some friends on Wall Street, I have some friends that are in finance, they seem to think it will be about two years, but it's kind of like reading tea leaves right?

152
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:27,500
The Federal Reserve is not very up front about exactly what they're going to do it.

153
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,500
And often times they don't know right?

154
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:36,900
They make moves the market reacts you know there's the Federal Reserve Has two main jobs, right?

155
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,900
One is to control inflation and the other is to control unemployment.

156
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,300
So those are the two things that they look at when inflation is too high.

157
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:53,300
They have to raise rates but if rates are too high again that slows down the economy which creates unemployment, right?

158
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,100
So there are always trying to balance these two things and it's not easy.

159
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:05,500
I mean If you look at governments in the past, even, you know, before the United States, right?

160
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,400
You had the British Empire, you had the dungeon power, all these different Empires.

161
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,900
A lot of them went broke because they couldn't figure out the right balance.

162
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:13,600
Right?

163
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:28,700
Says wow, not easy to figure out and you know, I really don't know how long it's going to last but it is one of those things where covid-19 as unprecedented economic event, I mean the entire economy basically shut out.

164
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,000
Across the globe.

165
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:44,100
So, real economic activity was very low but at the same time because You know, the US Treasury was spending, so much money stocks were going through the roof, right?

166
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,800
Crypto is going through the roof.

167
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,400
Real estate was going through the roof.

168
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:58,800
So you kind of have this weird dynamic where, I mean, everybody knew the economy was down, but at the same time, all the traditional economic indicators were, right?

169
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:06,200
So yeah, it just created this, this is where weird scenario that the FED has to try to fix them.

170
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:21,000
So now understanding a little bit of the last couple of years and the macro of what's taking place with the feds interest rates, how does that affect all other parts of our Lives?

171
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,200
I mean, if you think about like we're in Tech so, you know, address that but what else are you seeing?

172
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:42,700
Across the globe across other Industries and you know you anything that you see trend-wise like how is the ripple effect of this Affecting all other parts of ultimately, you know, economy in our lives.

173
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah.

174
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,200
So it's interesting.

175
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,300
What effect is that the u.s?

176
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,000
Dollar is going crazy right now, right?

177
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:07,100
So I am here in Colombia and the Colombian peso to dollar exchange rate recently broke five thousand to one which means it's 5,000 pesos for every US dollar.

178
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,700
That's a historic Height.

179
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:15,600
Been Never, it's never been this High and the same is happening with currencies all over the world, right?

180
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:26,300
And the reason is, because as the FED raises interest rates, that means that things like treasury bills, all of a sudden become better Investments.

181
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,100
So everybody is buying us treasury bills and things like that are denominated in u.s.

182
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,800
Dollars.

183
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:41,200
So the strength of the US currency is actually shooting through the roof, which is not that great for other economies around the world, right?

184
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:53,900
Because every economy did the same thing during covid, they all printed money, But the United States because we have the world Reserve currency, which means that everybody wants to hold US dollars, right?

185
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,400
Even though we printed money, we can, I mean, we can get away with it more than other countries.

186
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:12,900
So I mean, I am here in Columbia and everybody is worried about the exchange rate, because the services has become way more expensive in Colombia, especially things that are imported from the United States because they're denominated in dollars.

187
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But everybody here is Hayden pesos right?

188
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,300
Wow.

189
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:23,700
So it's really having a drastic effect in people's livelihoods outside of the United States.

190
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:34,200
So that's one thing I have noticed this but being outside the United States currently and you talk about technology how it impacts technology is.

191
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:46,500
If you look at where all the Investments went over, the last decade and a half and especially over the last two years when you know, forty percent of the dollars were being printed.

192
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:57,700
A lot of that went to riskier Investments like technology stocks, like cryptocurrency and all of this came from all this money printing, right?

193
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:05,400
So, essentially in Tech, Money's been sort of free because the government prints, all this money, and most of that capital.

194
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,400
Ends up going into the hands of Technology startups, technology companies and cryptocurrency.

195
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,800
And now all of a sudden that's gone, right?

196
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:29,400
So it's very challenging environment for technology companies in particular because in a lot of ways, the last 15 years of tech has been a giant bubble and now that bubble is popping.

197
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,000
So describe the bubble.

198
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,800
What do you mean by that?

199
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So, remember when I said I first moved to California, because my dad got a job during the first.com.

200
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,300
Boom.

201
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,100
So that was another example of a tech bubble, right?

202
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,500
There was actually the first tech bubble that we had.

203
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,800
And so what happened was everybody was putting their money into Tech, right?

204
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,100
And then, so there was this, a lot of money sloshing around in the tech ecosystem.

205
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,900
So one example I can give you is Yahoo which was the big internet giant back in those days.

206
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
As they sold at who bought those ads.

207
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,500
Well, they were startups that were funded by Venture capitalists right?

208
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,100
Those Stars didn't really make any money but the only way to get new users was to go to Yahoo and buy ads.

209
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:27,100
So then Yahoo's business went up, but and the entire Tech ecosystem was booming, but it wasn't really based on anything real, right?

210
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,800
It was just a bunch of money being funneled into the ecosystem to drive that Innovation.

211
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,900
But ultimately these companies weren't really making that much.

212
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,200
Real money, right?

213
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:48,500
It was just this all circulating around the same ecosystem, and so I think in a similar way that's sort of happened in the last 15 years as well during their most recent Tech.

214
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Boom, and Tech bubble.

215
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,000
Although obviously there's a lot more people on the internet.

216
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,400
Now they're certainly more money to be made on the internet now.

217
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,100
But are these companies are these startups really that valuable?

218
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,600
And from what we have seen, the answer is no right.

219
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:15,900
Like Once, you turn off the spigot of free money from the Federal Reserve, you see companies lose 80% of their valuation, sometimes, 90% of their valuation, right?

220
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:22,600
And so that the markets really correcting itself right now and it's happening in the riskiest assets first, right?

221
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:29,700
So, so crypto corrected itself first and then, you know, private tech companies.

222
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,900
And now you're seeing the same thing with public tech companies, there's a big correction there that's happening to the value.

223
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,300
Ation because people were trying to figure out.

224
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,500
All right.

225
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,400
How much are these companies actually worth?

226
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,300
What's does it ever actually have any clothes, right?

227
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,900
Or is it just funny money that, that they're playing with here?

228
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:51,100
How and this might be a whole nother conversation, but how are those valuations even determined?

229
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,700
That's a really good question.

230
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,900
So there's their standard measurements, right?

231
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,000
You can take your revenue and assign it a certain multiple.

232
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,300
There's you can take profits and assign a certain multiple although revenues a little bit more.

233
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,200
Common because most tech companies are not profitable.

234
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,400
Right?

235
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,300
At least in the beginning.

236
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:20,500
So you can say, you know, say your company makes a million dollars a year and you want to sign a 10x multiples of that.

237
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,700
Then, the valuation is, is 10 million dollars.

238
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,300
Right?

239
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,500
But you also have to remember that, it's a free market.

240
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:33,200
So the ultimate answer is the valuation is whatever investors are willing to pay for it.

241
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:43,800
So if there's a lot of money available for investors to pay for Tech startups and there's a limited amount of tech startups which is always the case.

242
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,100
There's always more money looking to find a home.

243
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,500
Then there are good hopes, right?

244
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,700
Interesting.

245
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,400
So it's going to artificially inflate, the value of text are because at the end of the day, your valuation is whatever.

246
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,900
Somebody is willing to pay for it.

247
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:09,900
So, so you're saying that, there's, I want to pull that through that statement, you just made, there's more money out there to invest to land somewhere, but there's not enough maybe startups.

248
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,600
Fill tool and the money in?

249
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,800
Is that what?

250
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,500
I heard?

251
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,400
Absolutely.

252
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,000
Absolutely.

253
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,400
Absolutely.

254
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,700
For the same reasons that we talked about, right?

255
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,600
It's really easy to make money in a sense, right?

256
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:28,900
Federal Reserve can just print money out of thin air or more specifically, the US Treasury could just print money out of thin air.

257
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,100
And because the best investments are typically technology because technology is what drives human productivity forward.

258
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,300
Most of that money goes into technology but the scarce resources always innovation Right.

259
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,900
People that can truly innovate companies that can truly innovate are actually quite rare.

260
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:58,200
So what tends to happen is you have the big Winners or the people that, you know, like Facebook or Google or Tesla, right?

261
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:07,900
They receive a Lion's Share of that investment because it proven that they can edit innovate and then startups receive a big share of that investment as well, right?

262
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,500
But not every startup is It is going to succeed.

263
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:18,600
And so, what ends up happening, is the valuation of a lot of startups gets over inflated as well during those times.

264
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,000
Gotcha.

265
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:33,700
So, you know if you just look at this last year, I have heard there's been over 42,000 layoffs to date and probably more counting what's your take.

266
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:46,000
I mean, I obviously you have shared all the reasons why we have gotten to this place but Are we going to continue to see more layoffs across tech companies?

267
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,400
And is it going to stop or is this just a norm and what's going to happen with all those employees?

268
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Now who don't have jobs in Tech?

269
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,000
Is this where employees in Tech?

270
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,500
If they want to stay in Tech, need to start their own startup.

271
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:09,100
Or, you know, how do you stay in Tech and continue to survive?

272
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,500
Yeah, I mean that number honestly, sounds low 42,000.

273
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:21,400
I don't know the exact number of layoffs, often, you know, those numbers are not made public, right?

274
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,500
Certainly, if you're a large public company, you have to, you have to file those things.

275
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:33,300
But if you're a small start-up, you might not necessarily in might not even necessarily be on everybody's radar.

276
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,600
Yeah, I don't lie.

277
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,300
Don't know, I don't know.

278
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,400
If there will be more layoffs, I think it really depends on each company's individual situation.

279
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,000
And by the way, not every company is, is doing that poorly right there.

280
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:07,300
There are certainly technology companies that have very resilient business models, or for some reason, not as impacted by the economy, the current state of the economy or as impacted as other companies.

281
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:23,900
So there's certainly companies hiring I You know, we're part of the Kleiner Perkins portfolio and whenever one company in our portfolio has layoffs often those profiles are circulated to other portfolio companies that are hiring, right?

282
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,800
So I don't want to pay this picture that it's like, just doing Gloom across the board.

283
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,300
There, there are, certainly companies that are hiring.

284
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,200
There are jobs to be had.

285
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,900
Yeah, it's, it's tougher out there, right?

286
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,900
And, you know, salaries that have gone up.

287
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,600
Over the past few years really for every role.

288
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:54,700
And I think a natural thing that's going to happen is jobs might be available but I think salaries are going to have to correct as well, right?

289
00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:00,600
Because if companies are making less profit they have you know they want to get to profitability really.

290
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:16,800
The only lever you have aside from layoffs is your compensation And, so I think we will start to see correction in compensation at tech companies.

291
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,500
Honestly, it's, it's been pretty crazy.

292
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:26,600
Like how, how many salaries and compensation has gone up over the last few years, right compared to before.

293
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:32,000
And now that companies don't have the prophet and the valuation to be able to pay for the salaries.

294
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,800
I think you're going to start to see those those celery start to come down.

295
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,100
That's interesting.

296
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,900
What are your thoughts on?

297
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:47,300
So I want to pull the thread of what you mentioned earlier of like there are certain tech companies that are resilient and thriving.

298
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,700
What type of companies are those?

299
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:58,600
So that's one question and then the other question I had been for those who want to stay in Tech, maybe they were affected by a layoff.

300
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,800
What should they be doing?

301
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,800
You know, so there're two questions there, but we can answer the first ones first.

302
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,500
One is the companies that are resilient.

303
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
What do they look like?

304
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,600
Why are they able to do?

305
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:21,900
Well during a time like this, Yeah, I think there's a few interesting data points here.

306
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,500
The effects in the economy are not really spread out that evenly, right?

307
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:44,000
So for example if you look at Airbnb is actually doing quite well because even though you know overall people's paychecks might be getting Slimmer one area where people are still spending money is travel, maybe that's intuitive.

308
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,500
Maybe that's not right, but people are still spending a lot on travel.

309
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,800
So travel companies are still doing quite well.

310
00:27:48,800 --> 00:28:06,500
Like Airbnb, I think one area where Companies are really struggling as if your company is advertising dependent because one of the first things that gets cut, if a company seeking that become more profitable is advertising spend, right?

311
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:19,200
So that's why you see layoffs at maida, you see reports that you know, at Google and other companies that depend solely on Advertising as their business model, at least in the short term, right?

312
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,100
Like those companies are really going to struggle.

313
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:43,800
And you know, one other thing is, you know, SAS sped, right SAS spent at least from what we have seen has been pretty strong even in this economy and I think that's because at the end of the day, you know, SAS is just such a big part of how companies run today that it's tough to completely rip out some of these systems, right?

314
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:51,600
And so companies like Salesforce for example, or companies that have a really strong lock in for as a SAS platform.

315
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,500
Two other companies.

316
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,000
They're doing, I mean not great, right?

317
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,200
But they're, it's all relative.

318
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,400
They're doing better than some of these other companies.

319
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,300
Gotcha, an AI.

320
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,300
That's another boom.

321
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,500
That I am seeing Jasper AI, for example, their content generation company.

322
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:18,300
They just got 125 million series a like a 1.5 billion valuation or something crazy like that.

323
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,600
So we're seeing the AI technology really, boom?

324
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,900
What are your thoughts to that?

325
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:27,900
Yeah.

326
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:33,000
I mean it certainly seems to be you know the new hotness, right?

327
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:51,300
Like I think every year you sort of had this new technology or there's new promise that a lot of investors flock to and that currently seems to be AI A lot of these companies, I mean, I don't know how they're doing financially, right?

328
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:06,300
But they're receiving a lot of investment because There's been, there's been a few advancements that have been pretty revolutionary recently, and they're all around this idea of generative AI.

329
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,900
So what exactly does that mean, right?

330
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:15,900
So one example of AI is you say, for example, Google Search, right?

331
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,000
Google uses a lot of AI.

332
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So you search for something in Google, can kind of point you into the right direction or Facebook.

333
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,100
Is another example, right?

334
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,200
I mean, it's kind of creepy, but they sort of know what you look like.

335
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:34,800
And so it will suggest you images, where you're in the picture, maybe you didn't know, and you can tag yourself, things like that.

336
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,400
So, that's really where a, I was at for.

337
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:52,000
I would say the last decade was, it was just really good at finding these patterns and a lot of data and more recently, there's been advancements in what they called generative AI, which is using AI to actually produce unique things.

338
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,300
Whether it's a blog post, right?

339
00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:04,100
Or whether it's an image or You know, meta and Google recently, it has show that it's possible to use AI to even produce videos, right?

340
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:11,600
And if you look at, if you actually play around with these tools, you will realize, I mean it's got a lot of bugs, right?

341
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:29,100
It doesn't often produce exactly what you want, but the rate of innovation is increasing in these areas and venture capitalist want to pour money into an area, where a lot of smart people are working on it, and the rate of innovation is high.

342
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,000
Nobody knows if there's actually a good business case for a lot of these Technologies.

343
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,800
But right now it's, you know, sort of the, the hot, the hot technology at the moment.

344
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,200
So interesting.

345
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:52,000
Okay, I wanted to go back and answer the question that I had earlier which is around those affected by the tech layoffs right now.

346
00:31:52,400 --> 00:32:00,100
And, you know, for those that want to remain in Tech, how do they need to innovate?

347
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:10,800
Like, do they need to be learning more about Ai and, you know, studying some of the trends of the most Innovative Tech that's out there and jump.

348
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,500
On board with those type of companies, or what do you advise, for those who have been affected?

349
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,100
By layoff.

350
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:28,500
Yeah, so I mean that's a tough question to answer because I think it depends on the individual, right?

351
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:36,700
What they're interested in what their skill set is how they want to apply that to the technology space.

352
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,800
For me, when I thought about at least when I was an employee, right?

353
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:51,200
One of the things I thought about was how do I, how do I put myself in a position to succeed in the long term?

354
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,500
Right.

355
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:04,100
And so, when the iPhone first came out, for example, I knew that technology wave like, I didn't know how big mobile would be.

356
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:17,000
But I was like, you know what if I put my bet in this mobile wave, I want to learn everything that I can about it because I just see a lot more growth opportunities there than I do in defense for example, right?

357
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:26,200
Like but defense, is it just wasn't innovating at the same rate and so, I think you know, layoffs are always tough right?

358
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:44,600
But I think sort of aligning yourself and hitching Your Wagon to technologies that you feel like have a lot of promise that a lot of investors are putting Capital into I think is always a good idea.

359
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:52,000
Again nobody knows how long this recession will be but there's still companies hiring right there are still companies hiring.

360
00:33:52,600 --> 00:34:01,000
Even during this time, it's again, it's sort of uneven wear which companies are most impacted.

361
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,500
So what are as an entrepreneur as a Founder?

362
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:21,000
What are the qualities that you think employees people need to have in a bear market like now you know in order to be resilient and to be successful?

363
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,699
That's best.

364
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,500
However, they Define.

365
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:29,199
That I know there's some just mindset attributes that can help folks.

366
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:46,100
As they are waking up every morning and whether it's working on their resume and getting things out, or tackling a product that they're trying to drive pipeline for, you know, Across the board.

367
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:52,199
People are feeling the recession and the effects of the uncertainty it creates.

368
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:56,000
So what do you advise for how we show up?

369
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,700
What's the mindset we carry?

370
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,200
What do you do?

371
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Yeah, I mean stay resilient.

372
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,000
This is one of those things where if you think about the economy, right?

373
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,500
It's very psychological.

374
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,000
When people's, I am sure you have noticed this, right?

375
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,600
Like when everybody thinks the economy is doing bad, the economy is of doing that.

376
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,300
Because at the other day, the economy's is composed of people, right?

377
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:29,200
And yes, of course, the Federal Reserve and all these macroeconomic factors played a part in to it.

378
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,400
But I think our Collective psychology, also plays a big part in to it as well.

379
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,500
That's why certain companies do better than others, right?

380
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,300
Because their Collective psychology is, is more positive.

381
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:46,000
They're like, well, yeah, you know, I am just going to control what I can control these other macroeconomic factors.

382
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:58,600
I can't really control, but I mean, it sounds sort of tried to say, but keeping a positive mindset actually does help because then you start to think about ways, we're okay.

383
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,800
Well, you know I can't really Troll these things.

384
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,200
So I am not going to worry about those.

385
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,100
But this is one thing I can't control, right?

386
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:12,300
So for me right now, one of the things that I can't control is our own product and our own company, right?

387
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,800
Like how do we innovate in this time?

388
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:21,100
What are some opportunities that are emerging now that didn't really emerge before, right?

389
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,700
Like you look at a lot of our competitors, and they're struggling to write.

390
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,300
So in a way it's harder to catch competitors.

391
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:40,200
When the economy's doing good, Because they receive more funding and more funding leads to be able to hire more people and there's this positive Loop but when the economy isn't doing so great, right?

392
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:48,000
The if you're a larger, you actually have more of a disadvantage, because it's harder for you to Pivot, that's hardest for you to adapt.

393
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,000
And I think the same is sort of true of individuals, as well, right?

394
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,900
Like you have 100% control over what you can control and being able.

395
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:15,200
Able to Pivot and adapt quicker is always going to be an advantage versus, you know, feeling helpless, which we all I think tend to feel helpless during these times.

396
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:29,500
But I do think the ones that can keep a more positive mindset and think about what they can control, both companies and individuals are going to end up being more successful and coming out the other side of the recession in a better spot.

397
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,100
That's great.

398
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,300
Love that.

399
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,500
All right, I am going to ask a completely different question.

400
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,100
We're going to move into cryptocurrency, you're touching it a little bit.

401
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:49,400
Walk me through just a little bit of your experience in crypto and, you know, as an investor.

402
00:37:49,400 --> 00:38:01,000
Like all those things yourself like, give us a little bit of a history lesson of crypto and how we have gotten to where we're at today and like help.

403
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,200
Help Define that landscape if you will?

404
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,700
Yeah, so I am not super involved in crypto.

405
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:15,600
I played around with Bitcoin and a few others, but I am not the most knowledgeable person about crypto.

406
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,600
There's certainly other people at welcome that have a lot more knowledge and experience than I do.

407
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:29,700
But the way I look at crypto is its the first real fundamental innovation in money itself, right?

408
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:42,000
So if you think about what money actually is throughout human history since the invention of money, Any money has required basically like a centralized authority to say.

409
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:49,000
This piece of gold is valuable or you know, this dollar bill is valuable, right?

410
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,000
If you think about it, if I give you a dollar like how do you know that dollars any good?

411
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,600
It's because the government of the United States says it's valuable, right?

412
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:13,000
So throughout human history, it's been government's typically that have had control over money and crypto starting with Bitcoin and the fundamental Innovation by Satoshi Nakamoto that the you know, pseudonymous Creator Vic.

413
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:20,600
Coin was that now we can use math and I won't go into the specifics about that math.

414
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:28,200
But essentially we can use math and place of governments to create a currency that people can use and Trust, right?

415
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:37,600
So this is, I mean, to me, I think this is probably one of the most breakthrough ideas and breakthrough, Innovations in all of human history.

416
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,500
I think, I think it's bigger than the internet.

417
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,800
I think bigger than computers.

418
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,500
I think it's bigger than cars.

419
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,900
It could fundamentally change human civilization.

420
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
So that's why a lot of people are excited about it.

421
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,600
That's why there's been so much investment into it.

422
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,700
It's been, I think it's been about 14 or 15 years.

423
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,200
I can't remember the date.

424
00:39:59,200 --> 00:39:59,600
Exactly.

425
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:10,400
But it's been about 14 or 15 years since the invention of Bitcoin since then, there's been applications of the same decentralized technology into other areas, right?

426
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,400
So instead of just Money.

427
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:23,500
That's that centralized people are working on ways to decentralize the entire Financial system decentralize laws decentralize.

428
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:33,000
You know, a lot of people make fun of MIT and if T is right, but even decentralize art and collectibles and things like that.

429
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,500
So there's a lot of really smart people working in crypto, but it's also a very risky investment asset.

430
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,700
So just as it went up.

431
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,300
Really sharply during the last couple of years.

432
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,700
It's plummeted quite a bit now, as well.

433
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,200
Hmm.

434
00:40:52,900 --> 00:41:05,600
And you know you were talking about earlier just something very interesting that's happened, even today about the purchasing of the ft x.

435
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:19,000
And you mentioned, you know, even today in history there's some pretty unique things taking place in crypto Yeah, I mean cryptos kind of like the Wild West, right?

436
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,100
Like if you remember, all the western movies, The Wild West is an untamed place.

437
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:34,900
It's a place of, there's a lot of lawlessness, there's a lot of scams, there's a lot of shady characters, and I would characterize a Cristo space, the same way, right?

438
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,000
It's a, it's not for the faint of heart.

439
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:44,000
I will say that I live in Puerto Rico and there's a lot of crypto folks in Puerto Rico, some people are generally trying to advance Humanity.

440
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:55,400
Some people are trying to You off and the governments around the world, have really been slow to react in terms of like, how do we regulate this thing, right?

441
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:01,400
How do we regulate something that's fundamentally decentralised and is designed to take government out of the equation.

442
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,800
Very difficult problem to solve, right?

443
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And, so I think the, the same reason why a lot of people are attracted to crypto, is also what makes it makes Dangerous.

444
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,500
And also what makes, you know, what makes it risky for a lot of people as well.

445
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,700
So, the event that you mentioned today.

446
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I mean, I have to jump in about a minute, so I can't get into a whole lot of details, but essentially, the number one, crypto, Exchange Finance.

447
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:55,200
Excuse me, in the period of about bless you in the period of about two or three days, triggered a series of events which led to Their number two, competitor, FTX essentially needing a bailout and a now, they're working out a deal.

448
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,900
Where the basically, the number one, crypto exchange is buying the number to crypto exchange.

449
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:08,200
And people are still trying to sort out what happened but there's not a lot of regulation in the space, right?

450
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:14,900
It's sort of shoot first, ask questions later type of environment and it's pretty crazy.

451
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:32,700
It's straight out of a Hollywood movie I think and maybe in a later episode we can get into the details but it really highlights, you know what makes crypto so interesting but also makes it an extremely risky proposition as well.

452
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,400
So fascinating, the Wild West indeed.

453
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,300
All right, Jerry will thank you so much for your time.

454
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,500
I look forward to our next conversation.

455
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,200
Yeah, thank you, Gina.

456
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,900
All right, I am stopping their Gordy.

1
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,800
Still, enough time to figure out how to chase away.

2
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,300
Who loves me?

3
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Hello.

4
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:41,200
Hello or I should say aloha as I am tuning in here from Honolulu Hawaii, and it's so great to see you.

5
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:49,600
This is our first event actually of the Year and a happy New Year were Midway into the first month of a fantastic year.

6
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,400
I have a lot of hopes for this year.

7
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,500
It's going to be great.

8
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,800
And today's topic is on webinars, at every step of the buying cycle, I am really excited.

9
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:06,300
Cited to introduce and I would love to bring up to the stage actually Megan Sullivan.

10
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,500
She is the demand gen lead at tulip interfaces.

11
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,800
Meghan, feel free to jump on up here.

12
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,400
Hey, how's it going?

13
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,700
Thank you for letting me talk today.

14
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:30,500
I am really excited to talk about my experience here at tulip and you know, past experiences focusing on how to engage folks using Ours.

15
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,100
Yes, I mean this is, this is.

16
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,900
But before we jump in to, to the topic, how are you doing?

17
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,000
Where are you tuning in from?

18
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,300
And how are you thinking about 20-23?

19
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,900
How are you doing?

20
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,700
Well, based in Boston, Massachusetts, which is nice company HQ as well.

21
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,600
So it's a little chilly kicking off this year, but hitting the ground running.

22
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:12,300
I already have a lot of the webinar calendar planned, which is great to see and have a great team behind me to support in that promotion and production.

23
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,200
That's awesome.

24
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,400
All right.

25
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,600
Well, we can jump right into.

26
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,600
So, what I hear is that 70% of your pipeline, that's generated.

27
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,800
That's marketing generated right now of that webinars.

28
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,800
Is a huge influence of your pipeline?

29
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,800
What percentage would you say or?

30
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
I don't know if you can quantify that.

31
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,700
Yeah, I would say right now with first touch.

32
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:47,800
So we identify a lot of our marketing Performance Based on that first touch.

33
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:58,700
I would say it's about, you know, 15 to 20 percent of that overall, 70%, give or take on the seasonality, right?

34
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:22,700
We all see that there's A lot of (webinar) for Teague in various parts of the Year, especially the summertime is a lot of (webinar) fatigue, but we're starting to see that ramp up a little bit more, but there's a lot of influence with webinars and our existing database continues to attend multiple webinars.

35
00:07:22,700 --> 00:08:11,000
Which is why it's really important for us to think about our topics that are timely and at what buying stage, that they're apart of, and I have been in the marketing field for over seven years now, working in marketing agency, working at a consulting firm and something, always ties back to those Live Events, but if you're smart about it, and I think we're seeing that Lay out here at tulip a lot as I kind of ramped up our webinar program and made it a sustainable program that creates you know, high quality content for our sales reps.

36
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,800
But also thinking about our personas right?

37
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We want to make sure that they're attending an event that's going to create insights or leave insights with them to be able to use those insights tomorrow and their day-to-day I love that, and I am excited because in our conversation today, we're going to unpack a little bit more of everything that you just touched.

38
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,200
But before we jump into that we do have a quick poll.

39
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:50,300
So let us pull that up real fast and just get a feel for how many of you actually two different Bolt.

40
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,500
The other one Sal.

41
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,400
So we have got our amazing producer.

42
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,100
Hey Sal.

43
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,300
He's a dark green room.

44
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,800
If you can pull the other one, there we go.

45
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,600
All right.

46
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,500
Do you use webinars as a key channel?

47
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,300
In your marketing mix today?

48
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:16,100
So feel free to drop your votes in there and give us a sense of how many of you are using this channel to actually drive your pipeline.

49
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,800
Wow, okay.

50
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
All the time.

51
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,700
Got a couple of votes and let us see if there's any other ones.

52
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,200
But okay cool.

53
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,000
Well, we have got folks that are very familiar with Averaging webinars.

54
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:40,100
I actually don't see a ton of folks who have, you know, maybe leveraged it as frequently, as, as you have Megan, or even as we have here.

55
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,900
So, okay, here and there, we have got another boat that cave in.

56
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,200
So okay, great.

57
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, that gives us a pulse and understanding of, you know, we got a lot of folks here that are pretty Savvy.

58
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,600
Probably with the power of what webinars can drive.

59
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,900
Before we jump into our conversation on that though.

60
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:13,300
Meghan, I would love to hear about your story and how you got into B2B marketing, can you take us back into your memory lane?

61
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,300
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

62
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:27,600
So actually got dual degree in public relations and marketing and, you know, I kind of jumped right into the agency.

63
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:37,200
Working at a full funnel demand, generation agency, based in Burlington Vermont, HubSpot agencies.

64
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:45,400
So I grew to, you know, own client base of, you know, around 13 clients at a time.

65
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:57,600
And we focus on any kind of demand generation strategy from the top of the funnel, all the way to, you know, sales enablement.

66
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:08,300
At the bottom of the funnel, even the systems integration in between you know Revenue operations ensuring that there's marketing and sales alignment from a systems perspective.

67
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:37,700
But also from a, you know, go to market and campaign strategy perspective and took some time as well working at IT consulting firm as a, you know, marketing lead identifying Membership program for certain members in the organization at that consulting firm, but then really love the agency life.

68
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:49,500
So I kind of went back to the agency locally, managed accounts again for a little bit, with a little bit of time and it's, I loved it.

69
00:11:49,500 --> 00:12:14,000
I think especially as a marketing professional, if you can dip your toes into agency, See life, you learn so much and that was going to be, you know what of, what of my advice notes is, you know, the B2B marketing Community is so close-knit and the connections, are you gain or pretty much career long?

70
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,700
And I did see that at the agency that I worked with, you know, with my clients, with my peers, I am Facebook friends with the, a few of them.

71
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,400
So it's, it's been a really great experience so far.

72
00:12:27,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Um, and then, you know, I decided to take, I wanted to just have one client of my own and that's where I found an opportunity at tulip interfaces where I was the first demand generation manager and then grew to, you know, lead a team of demand gen folks and one of our core tactics and our overall integrated campaign strategies webinars there webinars, and we went from running around for webinars a year to I believe we ended the year at 20 webinars, all from large-scale webinars to you know smaller scale more intimate settings.

73
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,800
Wow.

74
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,500
Okay.

75
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, first thanks for walking us through your, your path, your journey that's noted on the agency advice tip that you're putting out there, I actually come from an agency background as well, but more so B to C.

76
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:38,100
So it looks like an inch at she mentioned that she also came from a HubSpot agency.

77
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:44,900
So there's a ton that you can learn in agency life so that's great to hear.

78
00:13:46,100 --> 00:14:00,500
So jumping into what your career you that the number you just mentioned, you said, you know, you started with doing for webinars at tulip and then last year you ended at doing 20, what was it?

79
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,100
21 webinar.

80
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:09,600
Yeah, I think we ended officially at 20, a big increase in webinar production.

81
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,100
And it was kind of testing period, right?

82
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:21,000
We saw some success and 2021 with just a few webinars and wanted to ramp it up and see, you know what?

83
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,700
Topics are resonating and relevant with our Target.

84
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,900
Personas, we do what our Target.

85
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,800
Personas want to learn more about, and what are their kind of watering holes?

86
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:44,900
And our, our platform is targeted for manufacturers Global manufacturers, whether its life sciences General Manufacturing.

87
00:14:45,800 --> 00:15:01,200
Almost any company that, you know, manufacturers, our product will benefit from our platform and that industry is kind of Delayed in terms of they're progressing and you know where they look for Content.

88
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:13,900
So some of it is still in person events and trade shows and, you know, now we're seeing that increase in and attending online events, mainly webinars.

89
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,300
Gotcha.

90
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,900
So give us a little snapshot of who your ICP is.

91
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,000
And you know what?

92
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,900
What are their interests in your webinars?

93
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:24,700
Yeah.

94
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah.

95
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,800
Absolutely.

96
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,000
So like I mentioned were global company.

97
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:43,600
So we our customer database as you know, ranging from, you know, manufacturers based in the United Kingdom to India United States.

98
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:53,800
And we generally look for larger manufacturers that have multiple manufacturing plants so it is something to consider when we're targeting.

99
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:02,200
Certain people on LinkedIn is we do you know consider their company size and then you know the who is really important for us.

100
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:10,000
So we're targeting, and we usually have successful sales conversations with those operations leaders.

101
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:19,700
So manufacturing operations director that manages a few manufacturing sites that's experiencing certain pains like production efficiency.

102
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,700
You know they're not creating enough of a specific product in a certain period of time.

103
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,100
Time to be able to meet demands.

104
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:40,300
Additionally, you know, they might be experiencing some product defects and not know why or where in the entire assembly line that they're experiencing that's causing that effect.

105
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:54,700
So our Solutions help improve, you know, production efficiency you know decrease the number of defects and identify those root causes of you know issues.

106
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,700
And the assembly line.

107
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,200
So where we want to create content especially at the top of the funnel.

108
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:10,599
When people don't know much about tulip is, we want to focus on those pains and how people can solve those pains today.

109
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:25,000
So we might not get directly into, you know, tulip as a solution, but we identify blueprints with, you know, their current Manufacturing tech stack or their Current.

110
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:41,300
If they only use paper to you know track production, we provide insights that they can Implement tomorrow or start thinking about change management or start evaluating what their Manufacturing tech stack should look like.

111
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,800
You know, it's important to be really relevant.

112
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,600
I mean what you're seeing today is a lot of issues and supply chain.

113
00:17:50,800 --> 00:18:15,000
There's a lot of issues in Workforce transformation, you know people are You know, back when you know covid-19 an all-time high, you know people were retiring older more, you know seasoned workers on the assembly line that had tribal knowledge about, you know, how to assemble certain products and rolls behind it.

114
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,200
They were retiring and a younger more digital first.

115
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,400
You know, Workforce is coming in.

116
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,600
You know, how do you navigate that in?

117
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,000
And today's era.

118
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:34,900
So you know, it's really important to really understand where our personas are coming from what their daily challenges are.

119
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:54,700
And, you know, for just about all of our webinars, we, you know, talk about tulip as a potential solution towards the end of the webinar, once they, you know, see the why, you know, we're relating to them, you know, we have a lot of people at tulip that work.

120
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,800
In the manufacturing industry, which is why they wanted to work for a solution like tulip.

121
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:12,300
And I think it's really important to understand the Persona and maintain that Persona driven architecture, through throughout any content.

122
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,400
You create not just webinars.

123
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:31,800
Persona driven architecture that sounds like a real II love that articulation of, you know, the Each and optimization of the buyers journey is kind of like, also, like, how I see it too but can you walk us through?

124
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:40,700
Even just the process of how you were able to architect that for your personas and really identify?

125
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:50,900
Okay, these are the type of webinars that we're going to do top of funnel middle of funnel, bottom of the funnel, and why could you just walk us through your process?

126
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,400
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

127
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,200
So I went in a little bit into that top A funnel.

128
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:26,500
So thinking about what trends are happening right now, what's going on in the news that's affecting, you know, an operations leader today and really discussing those Trends and ways that you can adjust your operations, today really gets the attention of our personas because we're not, we're not pushing our product, you know, we're really just talking about the Core issues happening today.

129
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:40,900
Well for those that you know about tulip and know that they need a solution like tulip or there's a gap right now, and they're Manufacturing tech stack where we like to focus our middle of the funnel pieces.

130
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,500
Of content are more tailored.

131
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,800
We call use cases.

132
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:53,600
So a big challenge with manufacturers today is efficient traceability.

133
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,400
So being All to identify the and Trace.

134
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Everything from the raw materials to the form the suppliers, all the way through to those finish completed products.

135
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:27,300
People are having issues, you know, there are identifying those defects or there's a, you know, there's something missing that leaded that led to, you know, something being recalled, which is a huge, huge issue for big Brands because you show up on the FDA website for five years.

136
00:21:27,300 --> 00:22:07,500
I think saying that, you know, you had a product that went out that was recalled and being able to efficiently Trace those Raw materials, the Assembly of products to, you know, ultimately you know, out to the wholesaler is really important for certain individuals and even those plant managers, so getting taking deeper dives into those specific use cases is has been, you know, really beneficial for us for people to know, you know, how we solve for those specific use cases, but also it gives it a more.

137
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,500
To its setting.

138
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:21,900
So we get a lot of Engagement in our, our chat throughout the webinars, and we especially for some of those topics, you know, it hits home for some folks.

139
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:30,800
So they talk a lot about in the chat and you sometimes know our subject matter experts to go off script which is something that, you know, I even encourage.

140
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:47,900
You know, I think it's everyone's human and it's nice to you know, have that You know, sometimes like emotional communication through chat, you know, similar to this platform, we have the Emojis.

141
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:55,300
So you see, if, you know, people get angry at a certain, you know, controversial topic within manufacturing.

142
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,400
You kind of see those emotions right there.

143
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,200
But, you know, that's what we want to encourage.

144
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
We want to correct encourage that discussion.

145
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,400
Mmm, I gotta ask.

146
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,900
What platform are you using today?

147
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,400
So where are you?

148
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,700
We're using live storm.

149
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,500
Okay, gotcha.

150
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,700
So that does encourage then the Emoji engagement, all that stuff.

151
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,200
Okay.

152
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,000
God I gotta know.

153
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:26,000
And then what do you find as far as the average number of registrants to attendees?

154
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,400
Does that vary from top of funnel middle of the final bottom of the funnel?

155
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:48,200
Yes I would say for registration number you know for those mo-more top of funnel webinars and you know Live Events we do see a higher registration count but with that, you know, we do see a lower attendance rate which is okay.

156
00:23:48,200 --> 00:24:00,200
You know, I think it's important to you know edit it down a little bit and have a nice on-demand webinar for people to access.

157
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:20,200
You know, I Can, you know, I even register for a lot of webinars and I either forget or, you know, a tense and watch kind of while I am well, I am working or watch On Demand or catch myself, you know, watching halfway through or, you know, everyone's super busy.

158
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:31,300
So, sometimes I have to hop off early because I have meetings, but usually we see for those top funnel webinars around a thirty percent attendance rate.

159
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:38,600
Were you know, continuing to engage those registrants to get them to attend the live event?

160
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,900
But we're also really tracking heavily those watches after.

161
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:49,800
So those that are watching on demand, and we even have that as our its own source when reporting.

162
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:56,900
Because a lot of people watch webinars On Demand, they're just, they just rather watch videos and maybe ask questions later.

163
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:24,800
So, and then for the middle of the funnel webinars, we do see like A lower registration rate because it's a little bit more tailored and more Niche, but a higher attendance rate, so closer to, you know, 50% attendance rate, and a lot of chats, a lot of chats during the so encouraging, that continued discussion even through the chat, especially for those middle of the funnel webinars.

164
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,800
Gotcha.

165
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,000
And then do you have any bottom of funnel webinars?

166
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Like I guess I will be more like demos Riot.

167
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,900
So we actually we just towards the end of this calendar year.

168
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:52,100
We had a it was actually a just a live event on YouTube, so we encourage registrations just to get those so you can get those reminders, right?

169
00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:01,100
But it was actually an open event and it was called the Tulip showcase and it featured a lot of our product releases.

170
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:09,100
And then towards the end of the day of the event, we featured a few customers and what we call the groundbreaker award.

171
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:24,300
So, those true champions of our platform where nominated by either customer success managers or their own peers within a customer company, and we presented Awards to them so, that's awesome.

172
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:46,200
Yeah, it's um, Thing that we do it you know the first time we tested it and I think as we continue to evolve our webinar program and you know live event program it's we test you know what might work and this is something that was really successful.

173
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,600
So hoping to do that, you know.

174
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:55,300
Probably two times a year because a lot goes into, you know, recording those demos.

175
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:03,700
And, you know, hearing from those customers dominating those customers, but it's good to really great to see that success.

176
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
I love that.

177
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,100
That's great to hear.

178
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:16,800
And in fact could you walk us through just the event types that you have from top of funnel middle and then bottom?

179
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,200
Because that's a great example.

180
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,200
Of what somebody could do for a bottom of the funnel type of event.

181
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:28,400
And I know you have mentioned at the top of funnel, it's more awareness Trends, things like that.

182
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:41,800
But even with your industry, could you just give us some like topical Hands-On examples, what types of events you do, and we can start with top of funnel and then work on, yeah, yeah for sure.

183
00:27:42,800 --> 00:28:07,900
So some of the examples of our top of funnel webinars, So the beginning of last year we kicked off the year with kind of you know con little bit of edginess in the title in our in the manufacturing industry there are larger systems compared to, you know, start up, you know, platform like tulip.

184
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:23,500
There's these manufacturing execution systems that have been around for so many years, and we, you know, challenged Relevancy of those types of systems and it generated a lot of interest.

185
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:38,500
So talking about the challenges today of people that have a legacy or traditional manufacturing execution system and, you know, predictions for this, you know, for 2022 because we did in the beginning of last year.

186
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:50,900
So that was one of our big top of funnel webinars and to kind of Pull It fulls circle where we're actually in a couple weeks.

187
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,900
We are running a related top of funnel webinar.

188
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,000
That's, you know, still kind of challenging manufacturing execution systems today.

189
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:07,000
Revisiting those predictions that we made last year we write.

190
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:24,700
And, you know, noting some of the either the continued trends that we're seeing as well as, you know, new trends for manufacturers to Consider when you know, optimizing their operation strategy.

191
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:37,300
So those are two top of funnel vents that, you know, one is happening in a couple weeks that we're really excited about and another type of funnel event.

192
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:57,300
It's, you know, more geared to those that are you know evaluating either their current Tech stack or you know really He will experience those pains and potentially identifying budget for, you know, a solution that might fit their needs.

193
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:08,000
So it was almost kind of buyer's guide, you know, key considerations, when evaluating your Manufacturing tech stack or a manufacturing execution system.

194
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:19,900
So, and I think for some of those type of funnel events where it's like it's focused around evaluating a system, the time Is super important.

195
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:26,000
So either, you know, towards the beginning of the year, when maybe budget has been approved, baby budget has been cut.

196
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,400
So you have to really think smarter not harder with your budget.

197
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:36,300
So it's something also to consider when identifying topics and your webinar calendar is.

198
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,400
What's timely right now?

199
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,200
What are your target personas considering right now?

200
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,000
It's top of mind and that's why we usually do.

201
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,000
Everyone does kind of Trends, peace.

202
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,400
But a little spin on.

203
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,900
You know what?

204
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,400
What's in your Tech stack right now and should you be re-evaluating it?

205
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,100
That's good.

206
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
So, that's top of funnel.

207
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,300
That's a funnel.

208
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,200
Yep, middle.

209
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,700
What kind of event types, you have?

210
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,600
Yeah.

211
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,700
Yeah, absolutely.

212
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,700
So we did have the, the traceability webinar.

213
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,600
So that was how to make traceability your competitive Advantage.

214
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Not your burden.

215
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,900
You know, people especially with compliance audits people just consider our manufacturers.

216
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:30,600
Sometimes, you know, they think about traceability as just a compliance check box when in reality, It can be a competitive Advantage.

217
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,900
It can base on what your tracking, you can automate it and it can be.

218
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,100
It can provide you insights and how you plan ahead not look back.

219
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:58,200
So that proactive and almost like predictive insights that you can gather from, you know what you're tracking and tracing on the manufacturing floor.

220
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:06,300
Or is its kind of we, what we wanted to do is really have a spin on, you know.

221
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:17,000
This doesn't have to be something that pains you every day, you know, it's actually something that can help you be more proactive and scale your manufacturing operations.

222
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,400
Yeah, so that's one example.

223
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:34,400
We also have been, we're actually planning an event with some of our integration partners and focused on.

224
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,100
So that's going to be more, you know, middle of the funnel.

225
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:48,400
So, you know, we integrate with AWS Microsoft, which is something that like manufacturers really use and their Stack.

226
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:56,900
So doing more silver round table with some of our integration Partners like Microsoft like AWS.

227
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,500
That's something that we are planning and really excited about to.

228
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:09,000
So not only thinking about we what we did in the past but new ways to lead a conversation.

229
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,300
That's awesome.

230
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:12,800
Okay.

231
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:24,200
And then the bottom of the funnel event ideas that you mentioned were like the award nomination ceremonies are there any other ideas for bottom of the funnel events?

232
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:32,400
Yeah, so we are kind of going along with the use case Niche topics.

233
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:38,100
We do want to, you know, do more live, demo experiences.

234
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,100
It's not something that we have tested yet.

235
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:47,200
Yet, you know, a live demo, where someone can, you know, it's in a webinar platform.

236
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:57,500
We usually, you know, maintain our webinars as videos or when people are ready to have a conversation with us.

237
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,100
Because our tool our platform is, is a really large platform.

238
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:10,300
So, we want to tailor a trial or a demo to fit their exact needs.

239
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,699
That is something that we do want to test, and I really want to plan for that is based on one use case.

240
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,699
Here's how you can utilize tool.

241
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:23,900
Appears the different ways that you can create an application in the platform.

242
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,300
That's great.

243
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,600
Yeah, all right.

244
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,900
Well, we have got a question here in Q&A.

245
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:43,100
You can pull that up do you find yourself using several different platforms for different kinds of events?

246
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,199
Getting Clips out after and getting data and results?

247
00:34:48,600 --> 00:35:01,500
Yeah, so right now for webinars, we have actually, we used to use it for our virtual events that have multiple sessions, we would test out a platform and it wouldn't work out.

248
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,900
So we for our webinars, you know, we do like live.

249
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,800
ERM it, our marketing operations person on our team.

250
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,600
He built out and infrastructure to be able to, you know, it's not a direct integration.

251
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:27,000
But it does connect through zapier into Marketo, which is our marketing automation platform.

252
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:36,200
But I think with a lot of our systems that we have today, it does lead to exporting data and importing data.

253
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:43,000
And some spreadsheets which is you know something that we don't have to navigate daily.

254
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,800
So I do find myself and some different platforms and exporting.

255
00:35:51,100 --> 00:36:00,400
Hoping to improve that soon but sometimes it's good to get into spreadsheets every now and then but yeah.

256
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,300
And then what about your on-demand content?

257
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,100
How are you guys handling On Demand right now?

258
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:20,700
Yeah so we have a multimedia producer that we sent our webinar you know files to, and he cleans it up slightly, and we have all of our on demand.

259
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:26,400
Webinars on our website so people can fill out a form and be able to access it.

260
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:46,400
We what we're starting to do now is Put our webinars into more bite-sized pieces of content as well as chapters so people can click right to you know a section that they wanted to focus on almost like when they're downloading an e-book.

261
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,200
You know the table of contents should have a shortcut that leaves you.

262
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,000
No right to that section especially if it's a big white paper.

263
00:36:53,400 --> 00:37:03,700
So we want to make that experience the same as we do, you know, with our ebooks is being able to, you know, get to the, you know.

264
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:10,800
One just watch 10 minutes of you know when we talk about a specific customer case study, then they can do that.

265
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,600
That's awesome.

266
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,700
So this would be on the landing page of where you house the on-demand video.

267
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,600
You actually also have other offers you include.

268
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:19,900
Yes.

269
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,600
Yeah.

270
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:41,100
It's, and they're all single in that specific on demand video, you know, they can jump to the section that they want to listen to In Depth because you know, who has time today and I feel like everyone's attention span is, you know, just getting smaller and smaller.

271
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:57,900
So, so give them the tools to, you know, absorb content quickly and easily, so they can, you know, learn from it and get back to their day or hopefully continue to navigate through our content, but it's good.

272
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,500
So big question.

273
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:08,700
I have next is around promotions and driving registration and attendance to all of your events.

274
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,600
What are some of the key strategies?

275
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,900
Jeez, that you are finding effective to drive registration across the funnel.

276
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,000
Absolutely.

277
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,600
So we have a set of standard promotional tactics that we run.

278
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:33,400
We're always going to navigate to our database especially for those middle of the funnel webinars or for the top of funnel webinars.

279
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,000
If people are unengaged, how can we re-engage them?

280
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:44,100
Almost consider them a top of funnel lead, even if they have had a conversation with sales and it's been, you know, for months.

281
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,900
So our database This is really important to, you know, send those promotions to and engaging way.

282
00:38:51,500 --> 00:39:00,400
We also utilize LinkedIn, LinkedIn ads with the LinkedIn lead gen form, especially for those top of funnel webinars.

283
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:08,200
It's kind of lower barrier to entry especially like with the LinkedIn Legion form and you can be extremely targeted.

284
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:15,200
So we can Target certain industries, certain job functions within those Industries.

285
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,100
You know, make sure we're excluding you Competitors.

286
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,400
Or those that might not be a good fit for tulip today.

287
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,600
So that is a key, promotional tactic for us.

288
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,500
Additionally, we utilize tools for web content personalization.

289
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,100
It's actually something that we kicked off just in the most recent webinar.

290
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:45,000
So based on certain intent, that we see if they're looking on our website for you know, specific topic.

291
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,100
Then we can tailor.

292
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,600
A website experience where we're promoting engaging or tailored content to them.

293
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,600
So we're just testing that out actually today.

294
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:02,200
So always continuously improving and testing more things.

295
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:13,700
Additionally, because the manufacturing industry tends to navigate to specific watering holes like industry Publications.

296
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,500
We work with industry Publications.

297
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,100
A lot for some of our top.

298
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,300
The funnel webinars because that's where they go to be our Target.

299
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:38,900
Personas, go to access insights to get reporting, you know, ways that they can report on their manufacturing operations, or they would search for or subscribe for various topics.

300
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,300
So we want to be right there as a contender.

301
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,700
And we also have a tailored pop-up experience on our website.

302
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:56,100
So, based on relevant Pages, we also link right to a call to action.

303
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:08,000
And if there's a relevant webinar coming up for, you know, those that are looking at our manufacturing execution system guide, you know, we want that next call to action for them.

304
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:13,000
So we have those on our website on relevant pages.

305
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:21,600
Of course, and we also want to make sure that we're engaging LinkedIn organically.

306
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:35,300
So, we're ensuring that, you know, our speakers are reaching out to their connections, you know, promoting the webinar to their own audiences, so it's really organic there.

307
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:58,600
And then, lastly, and most importantly, I would say, is engaging and enabling our sales So we want to make sure not only when we're promoting webinars that you know the our sales team isn't able to promote those webinars in a timely manner to prospects those that are just trying to get, you know that booked meeting.

308
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:13,000
Maybe you know watching a webinar or attending a webinar that's relevant to their you know email conversation is going to help get that booked meeting or lead to a phone call or even you know lead to that close one.

309
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,700
Done deal.

310
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:26,800
We see a lot of prospects that are in the later stages of the buyers Journey even attending top of funnel webinars because if it's, you know, beginning of the year, they're just trying to evaluate everything.

311
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:43,000
So sometimes that gets, you know, us to, you know, show tulip as a contender and, you know, an RFP evaluation, but we're really trying to test all different angles and engage people.

312
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,800
In the most relevant way.

313
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:57,900
That's those are a lot of great tactics strategies you guys do biology across multiple random rant in a lot of different actors that we're testing.

314
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:04,800
But yeah, it's I think it's important to test different Avenues and learn from them.

315
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,500
That's great.

316
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:12,200
What website platform are you leveraging right now to be able to iterate quickly?

317
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,300
Yeah.

318
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:23,900
So we're using craft Hazard or CMS, and we also have other tools in our Tech stack like six cents.

319
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:40,100
So we're able to identify those accounts that are showing intent for various topics that are showing more intent for tulip, and we can t up some of those relevant webinars to them.

320
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,000
That's amazing.

321
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:42,800
Great.

322
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,300
And then about you mentioned also your connection with the sales team and how you leverage these webinars to enable them.

323
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:56,700
Can you describe like what is that interaction and regular communication like around webinar because?

324
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,300
Yeah, absolutely.

325
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:04,500
So I think it is so important to have that two-way communication between marketing and sales.

326
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:21,600
So that Marv up sales sees that what we're doing is really to help them and to help them progress deals, and get new leads, and that marketing is listening to their recommendation.

327
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:34,700
So for that webinar traceability, you know what we did was I created a survey for the sales team to understand, you know, what do our prospects want to hear from us?

328
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:43,100
What is leading to the most Well engagements is it you know focusing on a use case like traceability and that was one of the recommendations that they shared.

329
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:50,500
So it's not only enabling them but also hearing from them too.

330
00:44:51,100 --> 00:45:03,000
And when I first started here at tulip sales didn't really see webinars as a true demand gen tool and now they're kind of waiting for the next one to come out.

331
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:11,500
You know when's the next email coming out of you know, Adding the sales enablement content for our resources, for our next webinar.

332
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:21,900
So it's, you know, I think there's always a loop of continuous improvement with, you know, marketing and sales alignment.

333
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:31,900
But that's a, it was a good Milestone to hit their, you know, they're excited for that next webinar to be able to promote to their prospects or really excited to see.

334
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,400
You know, the high quality leads that come through that top of funnel event.

335
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,000
That's amazing.

336
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:53,400
Okay, I am going to get really tactical here on communication because you know, I asked these things because most of us have remote teams and so is there like a shared slack Channel where you're able to share out the upcoming webinars and the sales team can ask questions?

337
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,500
Are you updating them on daily weekly?

338
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,500
Like how does that interaction work?

339
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,200
And look like.

340
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,000
Yeah.

341
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:21,200
So I used to update the sales team weekly and their group email, I think what and kind of learn from their feedback that what's really important is to get all of the resources upfront and kind of monthly update but with weekly reminders and check in.

342
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:29,700
So again you know hearing feedback from sales, you know, how do you want to receive the sales enablement content?

343
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,900
When do you want to provide feedback right now?

344
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,500
That email communication is most beneficial Initial.

345
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:44,500
But you know, for some of those weekly check-ins we have that shared slack Channel where they can also reach out to me.

346
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,300
Also, you know, my doors always open to hear feedback and I think that's what's in route.

347
00:46:51,300 --> 00:47:03,400
What's really important to you that myself and my team is always willing to hear feedback that comes from sales and new ideas and recommendations because we do move forward with them.

348
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,700
And we hear what you're saying.

349
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,500
Huge that communication alignment is huge and that's awesome.

350
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:12,500
Yeah.

351
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,600
I mean you're always learning to it's a yeah.

352
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:35,700
I think it's like kind of I don't know if you work folks on the call or feel that too but there's always a gap that you identify and marketing between marketing and sales and how to you know fill that Gap is and understand why you're filling that Gap.

353
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:41,300
Across both functions and teams is what's most important.

354
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:48,600
So it's an uphill battle, but climbing up, awesome.

355
00:47:49,100 --> 00:48:00,700
Well, I think you have shared so many amazing golden nuggets about webinars and how we can attract folks to webinars what they look like across the funnel.

356
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:09,500
Is there anything else that you would add specifically about what And ours that you'd share to us?

357
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,400
Yeah.

358
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:10,700
Yeah.

359
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:30,700
I would say, I shared a couple tidbits, I think if you're able to live experiences compared to you know pre-recorded experiences are what drive that quality engagement throughout the event.

360
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,700
And you know, I think technical difficulties are okay, we're all human.

361
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:45,500
One of our top performing webinar that generated the most Revenue compared to all the other webinars.

362
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,800
There was a total dekhna technical difficulty in the beginning of the webinar.

363
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,500
But people, you know, stuck through and the quality of content was what's most important.

364
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:11,200
So I think those live experiences also show a company or as you know people that are, you know, Wanting to hear more from our Target buyers and engage that discussion.

365
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:35,400
So you mentioned a few things about you know, the beauty marketing Community, really maintain those connections that you gather even, you know, early on in your career because they are kind of career-long connections but also from a webinar perspective hearing from sales and when you can really, you know, have that live experience.

366
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,400
For, for prospects, to be able to engage in real time.

367
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,200
That's awesome.

368
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,400
Is there any?

369
00:49:45,500 --> 00:50:34,900
Final advice that you would give to the B2B marketing community, yeah, those connections are important and I think continuously learning from what you have produced and what you have launched, I think that's, that's another huge tidbit, especially if you're producing a lot like we did in the last year, learning from what worked and what didn't and being able to, you know, have that retro and clear, open conversation with those important stakeholders in a project this is really important for the sustainability of your team but also for you know your marketing program Amazing.

370
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:42,100
Well Meghan, thank you so much for taking the time to impart your wisdom across webinars.

Let us Die Young or lettuce leaf forever.

379
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:13,300
We do not have power pony, never seen it sitting in a sandpit.

380
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,200
Life is a short trip the musics for the sad man.

381
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:27,300
Can you imagine when the phrase one not gonna faces into the sun prison?

382
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:31,600
Our leaders we get in and turn the music played by them.

383
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,600
The mud, man.

384
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:29,200
So more like what is someone like to hear some of the men in some other be sooner or later?

385
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,800
They all will be gone but don't He stay?

386
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:40,600
It's so hard to get on without it, cause I don't want to perish.

387
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:49,200
Like a fading us cues like diamonds in the Sun and diamonds are forever.

1
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:51,900
Hello and welcome to today's Spotlight interview with Nick Bennett, who is the director of evangelism and customer marketing at Alice.

2
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,400
We are so excited to dive deep into what he's up to.

3
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,100
And so we're going to talk about evangelism in general.

4
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,400
What is customer marketing, dive, deep into why that's really important, especially, as we move into.

5
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,600
23, where it could be a down.

6
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
It's a down market.

7
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,000
So we need to be innovating and being good stewards of the business in general.

8
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,800
So I am really excited.

9
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,700
Nick, will you join me here on stage?

10
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,000
Hey, hello, how are you?

11
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,000
I am doing great.

12
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,300
How are you doing?

13
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,900
I can't complain.

14
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
It's a beautiful day outside.

15
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,500
Okay, so where are you tuning in?

16
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,100
From II?

17
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,800
Think I have got a map here that shows us sell our producer.

18
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,500
There we go.

19
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,700
Okay, so you're in Boston, I am all the way out here in Hawaii.

20
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,400
That's its like it's look how far away we are that.

21
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,700
But look, we're still here together.

22
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,100
Pretty amazing.

23
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,400
What time is it for you?

24
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,700
It is 220, 2 PM nice.

25
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,900
Okay, 9:02 PM or am sorry here.

26
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,700
So we have definitely got that distance between us.

27
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:14,400
However, what's amazing is, we could still be in our the same virtual room and hanging out together today.

28
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
Absolutely cool.

29
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,800
Well, Nick, tell us a little bit about what you're up to these days.

30
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,900
Yeah, so, you know, my in my nine-to-five we at Alice would like to do things.

31
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,900
So like everyone knows what you are and your 9 to 5 and so for me I run evangelism and customer marketing analysis.

32
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:39,500
I am a traditional field Market or an ABM Better for tech companies and for the last 10 or 11 years.

33
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,200
And then what we like to really talk about is the 529.

34
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,800
So what are you passionate about outside of work?

35
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,800
And so for me I play baseball still competitively, you know, I like to do a lot of fun things.

36
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:04,500
I love New England Sports, absolutely devastated me that Bogaerts signed with the Padres this morning, I was cursing the front office most of the day.

37
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,800
So, you know, hey die-hard Boston, sports fan and I have a four-year-old daughter.

38
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,300
Who honestly means everything to me and everything I do is for her.

39
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,000
That's amazing.

40
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,400
Well, we definitely were tracking with that baseball.

41
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:27,800
Fun fact, so Sal I went ahead and put that up there but yeah, jumping into some of these fun facts.

42
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:56,100
You know you got baseball so just so you know for me I used to do The movies television back in the day and I actually did a lot of background work for Ugly Betty, and she was awesome and it was fun playing these like we did these like Japanese Entourage Fashion Group type of, type of roles.

43
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,800
So that's one of my fun facts.

44
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:09,900
But there's another fun fact about eunuch that we would love to share and you were a rapper.

45
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,900
It was, right?

46
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,700
I went through a phase in high school.

47
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,100
Yeah.

48
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,300
Yeah.

49
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,800
It was something I went out and bought all the expensive stuff.

50
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,200
I had someone that mixed and produced all my music for me and it still floats around the internet.

51
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,500
All these years later.

52
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:42,200
Well, in fact, we have got this track right here and I have got to play this a friend of mine.

53
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,300
You got to get together to buy.

54
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,500
I have got my hat here.

55
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,700
Get out.

56
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,200
All right.

57
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,200
Can I put this on the chosen son?

58
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,500
And it's just your luck.

59
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,100
You about to Bear witness.

60
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:17,800
I got acid ronschuster CD as yeah any day, but they will be stepping on the see white Shades Boston fitted in a disc.

61
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,400
Three.

62
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,000
I think my track is my campus in the pain to my heart.

63
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:54,300
So for this, I still Blood, Sweat tears, and love, just so you can feel the inspiration from above Thanks for letting me play around, be little goofy with you there, but that's pretty dope.

64
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,000
You're very talented, Nick.

65
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
I like to do a lot of different things.

66
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:05,600
You do a lot of different things and you're handling it as a girl, dad, so lots of Kudos and props to you.

67
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,600
Thank you.

68
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,400
Hopefully that wasn't embarrassing.

69
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,400
Are you all right?

70
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,300
That we played that?

71
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,500
Yeah, absolutely.

72
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:20,900
Yeah, it's funny cuz I will share like that song randomly as I like, you know, we could be at Like trivia or something, like I will just drop in.

73
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:30,100
Then people like I had no idea, and I was like yeah I went through like it was like a two or three-year thing and it's just it's crazy that it just still flow.

74
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,000
I mean that's the internet for you just floats around there forever.

75
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,900
Hopefully in like 30 years it will still be there.

76
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,100
For sure, it's a great track.

77
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,500
I am impressed with your lyrical Rhymes there.

78
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:45,800
Cool.

79
00:08:45,800 --> 00:09:08,500
Well, you know, customer marketing as we dive into this topic, there was this one fact that I got from Bain & Company and the research shows that a 5% increase in customer retention can increase profits by 25% to 95%.

80
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,700
I mean that is insane and it's like, okay, why aren't we?

81
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,600
Holding down more here.

82
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,500
Can you just Define for us?

83
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,200
How do you define customer marketing and yeah, I didn't see it today.

84
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,700
Yeah, it's you.

85
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,300
So I want to kind of guess put it out there, so I have actually never done customer marketing before.

86
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,000
So this is all new to me, like I said, I am a traditional failed marketer, ABM marketer.

87
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,800
That's what I have done.

88
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:44,700
I was actually in sales before I moved over to marketing, so I have walked in sales is shoes which I feel like made me such a good feeling.

89
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Field marketer and ABM marketer because I understood how it all worked.

90
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,200
I understood the stresses of not being paid, your quarterly commission, and things like that.

91
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:07,900
So it was probably earlier this year before the market started to get really crazy and in my boss at the time was like, hey what do you think about moving over to customer marketing?

92
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:15,700
And there's going to be a strong focus on retention from the board and I said, cool, I am all for new Challenges.

93
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,000
I like to be a better well-rounded marketer.

94
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:29,300
I said, I am up for doing it, but I want evangelism as a part of it, and we can get to that later, how I broke that down, but my goal was to help with the nir.

95
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,600
So like their net revenue, retention side of it.

96
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,300
And I think that marketers today, you know, the customer marketers, get it, absolutely.

97
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,800
That NR is in is so important.

98
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,800
However, so many other marketers don't really focus on that, as a metric.

99
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:59,000
And I think that you should actually be focusing more on Nar today, then a lot of the other metrics that marketers are focusing on because we all know it costs less to retain a current customer than, to acquire a new one.

100
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,300
So why wouldn't you double down your efforts on that and that was really the whole thing?

101
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,600
And for me my goal is and it's, you know, again, I want to preface this.

102
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,700
It's a little bit easier when you Market to marketers and you are the ICP and you know, exactly the pain points.

103
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:26,100
They're looking to solve because you were looking to solve it for all these years and I have just been able to really jump on with customers strategize with them.

104
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:34,200
Focus on the social proof aspect the customer stories and not just fluffy customer stories because some let us be honest like who writes a bad case.

105
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,500
Study no one puts bad case studies out there.

106
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,300
Why would you talk bad about your company?

107
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:45,300
But when you can get tactical with a customer story and turn that into a Playbook, now that not only does that help with retention, Tension.

108
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,700
But it also helps Drive acquisition as well.

109
00:11:48,300 --> 00:12:02,700
So those are some of the things and honestly, it's even more alarming a little bit that leaders within companies, specifically in Tech right now are actually laying off customer marketers and keeping acquisition marketers.

110
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't agree with that.

111
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And I have seen layoffs affect a lot of customer marketers.

112
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,700
Unfortunately, within the last couple of months, you would think that is the one piece in the marketing.

113
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:23,900
Or that you want to double down on and I don't see why more companies don't put more resources and money behind it.

114
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,400
Do you think that could just be because customer marketing?

115
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:41,400
I mean, how long has it realistically been known and the practices the disciplines, the ROI, the attribution, calculated around it like, is that really understood today?

116
00:12:42,700 --> 00:13:02,100
I think the people that have I am doing it for a long time and I know I mean to me I have had to rely on a lot of these resources because it was some wasn't something that came like first nature to me, and so I have talked to a lot of customer marketers some that have been only been doing it for, you know, two or three years and some that have been doing it for 15 or 20 years.

117
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:12,600
So there is people in larger companies usually is where you see it you know you like the IBM's of the world and you know, HP things like that.

118
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Like they have had customer marketers.

119
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,100
Ever.

120
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,600
Have they been focused on different things and can customer marketing like should they build a customer Advisory Board?

121
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,100
Should they be focused on just driving, you know, reviews or something?

122
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,600
Should they be strategizing?

123
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,000
I think it's evolved a lot over the years for sure.

124
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,200
And I have always as a marker to talk to customers.

125
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:44,600
I can't I guess yo tell how important that is as a marketer, that you should be talking to customers and not just talking to them taking what they're saying and actually doing.

126
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:55,200
Do something about it, but to create programs, specifically built around retention and expansion upsell opportunities has been newer for me.

127
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:03,200
And I feel like I have done a lot that has made an impacted short time because I don't want to live, like, could I retention rate?

128
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,800
Be better.

129
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,300
Absolutely right now, 100%.

130
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,800
And I think everyone realizes that.

131
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,600
And so the programs that we're putting together is hopefully making an impact on that.

132
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:21,100
And I can already see a lot of The result even within the last five months, and it's trending, like, kind of like hockey stick style up.

133
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,100
So, alright, so let us go back a little bit.

134
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:34,700
Rewind, I would love to dive into your story into just even how you got to becoming the Evangelist customer marketing, Guru that you are today.

135
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,400
Take us back a little bit.

136
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,000
And how did you get into B2B marketing?

137
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah, so completely by luck to be honest with you, so I went to school for sports management.

138
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,700
Like I said, I played baseball, all my life played in high school, played in college and I went for sport management.

139
00:14:51,700 --> 00:15:03,500
And when I got out, I said I am going to be a big shot athletic director at a D1 school, or I am going to be a sports agent or something like that, and when I got out turned out, none of those were true.

140
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,500
I could go sell tickets for the Red Sox making $10 an hour, and I was like, oh, that doesn't sound.

141
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,100
Very fun.

142
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,000
Like why did I go to college for that?

143
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,100
But to be honest, I wasn't also a great student.

144
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:22,300
I cared more about baseball and I feel like being a marketer actually relates really well, the baseball and Sports in general, I feel like it's being someone.

145
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:33,000
Athletic is kind of made me a better marketer because kind of you know teamwork everything plays together really well, but I said okay, well, this isn't going to pay the bills.

146
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
My parents told me I needed to get like a real job.

147
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,700
And, so I said, all right, I am going to go into sales inside sales.

148
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,100
It was as for a tooling company, and let me just tell you like, that was boring.

149
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:52,400
Like I hated I was doing inside sales and I had to show up at 7 AM and work till 5 PM in sit at like an old computer.

150
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
It wasn't even a laptop.

151
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,800
It looked like it was from like the 80s, and this was like in 2000, like 12.

152
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:07,900
So, it wasn't even like that long ago and like I sat there and just took calls from basically General Foreman construction workers about like, industrial tools.

153
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,600
And like, I would go pick them out back and like, basically sell them and I had upsell them and all these different things.

154
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:20,500
So I never did sales for Tech, but I did sales for them and then I moved into Motorola actually.

155
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,600
And so, I ran Channel sales for Motorola after their AT&T account.

156
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:36,600
So at the time I was going up against the iPhone, every release for September, and we were trying to outsell them, and I had to come up with creative ways to get their dealer channel to want to do that.

157
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,300
And then I moved to like a channel marketing role which was still working within the same.

158
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:50,300
I had the whole East Coast for a Titi ta Titi indirect dealers and I would just work with them to kind of figure out spiff, programs and incentives.

159
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,800
Contest trainings.

160
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,300
All of those.

161
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:52,800
Things.

162
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,900
And I was like, oh, this is cool.

163
00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:01,800
I don't have a quota hanging over my head, but I get to do all these fun things and travel, and I was young at the time, so I was like, oh, traveling is great.

164
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:10,500
And then I went to another company, I moved into another Channel marketing role and then that allowed me to move into my first field marketing role in B to B Tech.

165
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,500
And it was the first true role that I ever really did.

166
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:14,900
I remember?

167
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,500
It was a company called Simplicity.

168
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:22,300
They were in the hyperconvergence space just outside of Boston years ago, a lot of EMC.

169
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,200
CMC people for people that know, EMC out there.

170
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:41,400
And I was like, this is so fun, like we get to do all these crazy things and at the time our CEO is telling us don't buy your yacht yet like we reached a billion dollar valuation in 23 months fastest in the it space to reach a billion dollar valuation.

171
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:51,300
And I remember all the sudden we had an immediate like all hands meeting and it was like HP bought us for 600 million and be.

172
00:17:51,300 --> 00:18:08,600
I felt bad because I was Only there for like a year and a half of people that were there for four five, six years, basically, they were getting nothing for their time because everything was under water at that point and then that was kind of like my I just kind of didn't look back at allowed me to start to do field marketing for a lot of these other B2B companies.

173
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,100
And that's kind of what I have done for the last eleven ten or eleven years now.

174
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,600
Wow.

175
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:14,900
Okay.

176
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:24,500
So walk us through how you got into evangelism and customer marketing specifically, yeah, so the It was in pieces, is interesting to me.

177
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,800
I have always, you know, looked up to people like sangram when he was at Terminus Ethan.

178
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,900
Buuck, who's that, bom, bom, Randy from Uber flip.

179
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:47,800
Like these people that have Chief evangelist titles, and I was like, wow, they're like out there evangelizing for a product and Company and in the it space I always saw Advocates as kind of like evangelist but I feel like it was developers.

180
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Like it was very interesting like I couldn't fit that because I was not a developer But I said, you know what?

181
00:18:53,800 --> 00:19:00,500
I said, Mar Tech in sales Tech is lacking this type of role from a non-executive standpoint.

182
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,100
And so when my boss came to me and said, hey would you be open to doing this?

183
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,500
And I said, yeah, but I want this.

184
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:20,100
I am going to tell you exactly why I said I feel like I have already been doing a lot of these things of, you know, helping be the face for the brand doing all these events, the podcasts, the prospect calls and customer calls.

185
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:27,400
I said I want to actually help Leave the path for what it looks like for non-executives to take to do these types of roles.

186
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,200
And I can tell you like, he was like, absolutely.

187
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,900
Let us pitch it to the leadership team.

188
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,600
So, I got on a call with the CEO, ocfo like everyone and I pitched it.

189
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
I said, this is why I think I should do this role.

190
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,500
And I said, B2B companies and more Tech and sales Tech don't have it yet.

191
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,100
You want to be at the Forefront of this.

192
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,600
I am telling you, and there was no pushback.

193
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,700
They're like, yeah, absolutely.

194
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:56,200
Like you're a perfect fit that role, And now you're seeing more and more people start to get these types of roles.

195
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:06,400
I mean, I think of people like Jen Al, and she was at the Challenger, she did just leave, but like her, you know, will Akin Nick Posey, Arthur Castillo from Chile, Piper?

196
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:18,800
Like, you're seeing more and more non-executives take on these evangelists /, like Creator type roles and I think from an evangelist perspective, your kind of mixture of things.

197
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,300
So like you're a subject matter expert you are out.

198
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:31,600
Are evangelizing on behalf of the product and communities wherever your ICP is meet them where they are, but you're also a Creator in a lot of regards.

199
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:40,500
If you look at a lot of people that have these types of roles, they're regularly creating content on LinkedIn on Tick-Tock, on all these other social media platforms.

200
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:48,500
And I think when you go to a company, say, hey, by the way, I have, you know, 40,000 followers on LinkedIn.

201
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,200
You know, all these on Tick-Tock, we should create this.

202
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,200
Type of role.

203
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,800
It's a lot more appealing, especially in the more Tech world.

204
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:08,500
And I do think, as we move into 2023 you're going to see more B2B companies start to either create these types of roles in Elevate people internally or start to externally bring people in.

205
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,700
Because I do think the Creator economy is going to blast off in B2B in 2023.

206
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,800
That makes total sense.

207
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,300
When do you think the chief evangelist?

208
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,700
Like this whole role really started to take traction?

209
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,100
How many years ago months ago?

210
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah, I mean I think the chief evangelist role has been around.

211
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:37,200
Like I think I like saying I am from even like I mean, I don't know how long he's been doing it but like he's been doing it for a while like I feel like Randy from Uber flips.

212
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,300
Been doing it for a while.

213
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,200
Ethan like you have these types of people that have done these roles for a while.

214
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:50,700
However, I do think The like the outcomes that you're looking to achieve from these roles are very different.

215
00:21:50,700 --> 00:22:03,800
Like in, I could tell you no one really has figured it out because I have asked probably about 20 to 30 people how they view, this specific role in everyone is very different from like how do they track it?

216
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:09,200
And measure it to what are the actual like objectives that they're looking to complete?

217
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:09,900
Yeah.

218
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,200
Could you walk us through?

219
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,500
What?

220
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Some of those objectives looks like look like even for yourself and then What are you tracking?

221
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,900
Yeah, so I think it's, you know, a big piece of it is external community building and participation.

222
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:29,100
So, like if you're a martyr tech company, for example, you want to be active where your prospects and customers hang out.

223
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,900
If it is in, let us just say Peak Community or rev genius or Pavilion.

224
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,800
Or I mean there's so many slack communities out there and Discord communities.

225
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,300
Now like just being active there.

226
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,300
You want to join the events and sessions to better network with your I see.

227
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:55,200
You're not selling them anything, you're just building those relationships so that when the time comes, they keep you top of mind, you just want to be in that conversation, ultimately from there.

228
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,700
The product has to do everything that you want it to and live up to the standards and the hype and all that.

229
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,200
But that's the first thing.

230
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:12,300
The second thing is internal employee advocacy and I feel like this is an important one because if you think about it and I will just give you an example.

231
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,300
So in 2020 to my content on LinkedIn.

232
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,700
Alone will drive about 12 million views.

233
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,300
So about a million views.

234
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,700
A month is what my content is driving on LinkedIn.

235
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,800
Now, you take, I post on Tick-Tock, I post on Instagram reels, YouTube shorts.

236
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,600
You take that, you amplify all that.

237
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Now, cool, you have one Nick now, what about all these other employees that are creating content or want to create content?

238
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,600
Think about that.

239
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
There's no cost associated with this.

240
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,200
It's just time.

241
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:52,100
And getting people to better understand how you like what are the outcomes that you actually want to achieve from that all of a sudden, say LinkedIn?

242
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,200
For example, you get 15, 20 employees creating their own content.

243
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,500
You're driving 15, 30 40, 50 million views a year.

244
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,600
Think about what you would pay an ad spend for that, it's through the roof.

245
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,500
Especially as ad spend continues to go up.

246
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:17,800
So, employee advocacy is a huge piece of it and I think that there are companies out there that kind of produced Like software and products to help support that.

247
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,800
I have been doing everything just from a manual standpoint myself because it's more.

248
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,900
So educating and people who are afraid to click post for the first time.

249
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,000
But if you just get them to share their stories and you don't want them to talk about the company.

250
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,900
If the come someone wants to hear about your company, they're going to go to your website.

251
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,200
They're going to go to other channels corporate handles.

252
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:52,400
They're not going to LinkedIn to hear me talk about Alice for example, they I go and I try to Share value But ultimately When I am getting, you know, 15,000 views to my profile, every 90 days, and they're clicking.

253
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,500
And they're saying oh by the way, he works for Alice, let me go see what Alice does.

254
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,700
Oh they're gifting company huh?

255
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,800
We use a gifting company we're up for Renewal I am gonna go check them out and submit a demo in how did you hear about us?

256
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:11,700
I am going to put that, I heard Nick on LinkedIn or from this podcast, so we can use self-reported attribution to tie everything back.

257
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,200
So that's that piece side.

258
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,600
The third piece is influencer marketing.

259
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:36,200
So again, I think this is you can look at it as like the Creator economy, influencer marketing, whatever it is, but it's working with the key people in your industry that you want to have promoted your company, your product, your mission, everything through that and yeah, you know, one off, engagements are cool and stuff.

260
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:45,300
But if you can build long-term engagements and ultimately create an in-house type of environment, we have creators that you eat that, you know, they work for the company.

261
00:25:45,500 --> 00:26:00,200
Benny, But ultimately they're doing their own thing and you just have all these people that are going out there and doing their own thing, it can do some serious damage and I think that's going to be another huge Topic in 2023 is influencer marketing and how to B2B companies leverage it.

262
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,900
Because b2c has a figured out really well.

263
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:08,100
B2B is still lacking behind there, the other ones, a prospect calls and customer calls.

264
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,000
So I joined seven to ten calls a week between Prospect or customer calls.

265
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,400
Yeah.

266
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:25,200
And it's not just sitting there at a no value like, Like I am leading these calls through strategy, through brainstorming sessions, and that's where I think the customer marketing piece plays into it as well.

267
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:33,600
It's like, great helping current customers retain them figure out if they're a makes any sense for upsell or anything for prospects.

268
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:40,400
And that's where from a customer marketing standpoint, those relationships should start at the prospect level and you should be working your all the way through.

269
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,300
Don't just take that hand off after they close a deal and when CS gets it, jump in.

270
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,800
Start to build Advocates from there.

271
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:53,100
You should be building Advocates from Way Beyond that, so that's that piece the external speaking and networking.

272
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,600
So for me, that's a big one.

273
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,000
So, like I in the last two years I have done about 90 podcast as a guess.

274
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,100
And so that has helped me kind of again, Drive awareness for, for the company.

275
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:15,200
And so Alice like I will single-handedly this year, do a million dollars in pipeline myself, just from organically creating content, and I am proud of yourself.

276
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,600
Reported after best nap for that just for a moment there.

277
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,100
That's pretty amazing.

278
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,300
Yeah, how much of that do you think we will close?

279
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,000
So probably about 60% base.

280
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:44,600
Yeah, it's I mean, I did 500k the year before in 250 close, so 50%, and our win rates are up and I feel like everything is better products in a better spot than it was a year ago, so I can see 60 to 70 percent closing easily and that's just again literally zero cost you.

281
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,200
No nope.

282
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,500
Pay two heads were run or anything from that.

283
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,900
It's just solely people coming in from self-reported attribution.

284
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
That's amazing.

285
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah.

286
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,600
And then the last thing that I was going to say is just from an evangelist and point.

287
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,900
Like you want to take these insights and learnings in figure out how to infuse them back into the business.

288
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,800
Because if you're out there and you're hearing all these things and you're not relaying this information or if you're not taking action on them.

289
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,800
What's the point?

290
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,900
It's like any marketing rule like you could hear all these things from a customer, you understand, the issues.

291
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,600
But if you just sit on it and do nothing, you're not going to win.

292
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,300
So to walk me through what that looks like?

293
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,300
Yes.

294
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:30,800
You're going across all of these different channels and opportunities and getting the word out there.

295
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,100
You're getting insights.

296
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,200
What does that look like tactically and sharing with your team?

297
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:35,800
Yes.

298
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:46,500
So it's quarterly presentations on kind of the learnings, from calls from events, from what the General market says, in its data to back it up as well on top of that.

299
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,000
And so we can see specifically how the market is trending.

300
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,100
How people are thinking about?

301
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,500
It in.

302
00:28:52,500 --> 00:29:00,100
Fortunately, I have a lot of friends that work at competitors, and so I am a lot of friends that are customers at competitors.

303
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:07,200
And, so I am able to kind of triangulate a lot of this information, so it helps make that roadmap better.

304
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,600
Because again, if you're hearing all these things in XYZ product feature is in on your road map.

305
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,900
Well, these 40 people said it should be, and they're choosing these competitors because of it.

306
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,000
You would think you want to get that.

307
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,800
That on your road map ASAP.

308
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,700
And so those are a lot of the things in.

309
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:35,800
So I usually put out a deck every quarter, that kind of highlights all these things plus a video and I usually presented in person, I mean virtually as well.

310
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,800
And this is with your team at Alice.

311
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,900
Yeah, exactly.

312
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,600
So it goes like, there's two different versions.

313
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,300
There's a leadership, like SLT like senior leadership version and then there's a marketing like version.

314
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:54,600
And there's a general company version, like just slightly changing the talking points and things like that, and kind of what's being shown.

315
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,300
But yeah.

316
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,600
What are some of the key things you highlight at each of those levels?

317
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,200
So to senior level because that gives me an idea of like the outcomes of what success look like.

318
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,900
So what do you present at that?

319
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,600
Your level.

320
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,400
Yeah.

321
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,100
So I think it's the ability on how are people thinking about the brand Affinity.

322
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,600
It's like, you know, great, are you increasing Revenue per quarter?

323
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:28,900
Are you engaging a certain percentage of customers per quarter or are you increasing customer satisfactions, which ultimately Drive higher MPS, surveys in scores?

324
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:39,900
Are you kind of getting a you can you showcase your attribute like a positive association with in the Brand and that's engagement things like that?

325
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:46,600
I mean, the senior leadership's, like numbers, you know, they're like, Yay, why would I invest in something like this?

326
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:56,900
If it doesn't produce Roi, but I feel like a lot of what I do 80% is tied to revenue programs and 20% is brand or experimental.

327
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:06,800
And I feel like this evangelist type role is somewhat experimental because some of the things that you could do, like, let us just take this me and you talk right now.

328
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,200
Now, you cut this up, there's micro-content.

329
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,300
You start tagging me.

330
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,000
All these people.

331
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,400
See it.

332
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,300
They click my name.

333
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,700
They go see what Alice does cool.

334
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
You just help me drive a ton of pipeline.

335
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,700
Thank you.

336
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,700
And like yeah, we can attribute some of that.

337
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:31,300
But what if people don't specifically you know say they heard about me from you or self-reported attribution just doesn't fall in a way that you wanted to.

338
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:38,700
I think the second piece is dark social or word of mouth or however you think about it and like if I go Tell ten people after this?

339
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,700
Hey I just did a session on welcome and you should go check it out.

340
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,300
If you're looking for a virtual event platform, that's not directly attributed but it's me telling 10 people.

341
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,200
And I feel like my word would hopefully hold a lot of weight with those 10 people.

342
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,600
That's good.

343
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,200
Wow.

344
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,600
Okay.

345
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:02,100
There is a question from Jeanette that we can pull up here.

346
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,800
How are you measuring self-reported attribution and how do you gather the data?

347
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,600
Yeah.

348
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:24,200
So basically, I am pulling Salesforce reports of anyone that has mentioned my name specifically and so it's been a little bit easier because I will see about two to three inbounds come in per week with, with my name, and we drive.

349
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:29,100
I mean, how we drive about 160 demos per month right now.

350
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:36,800
So it's a sizable amount, and I am seeing people start to put my name and Tick Tock next to it as well.

351
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:46,300
Which is a little bit newer because funny enough, I actually don't talk about Alice, it all in my Tick Tock, it's just, it's not an ALICE page, it's my own personal page.

352
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:55,900
But what I am doing is repurposing a lot of content that I create on LinkedIn and then creating videos of that and then posting it on tick-tocking Instagram rails.

353
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,600
And it's a completely different audience because not so many people from B to B, you're on there yet.

354
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,100
But the organic reach is absolutely like through the roof.

355
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,800
So really just pulling it down.

356
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,400
Yeah.

357
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:15,300
Really pulling Salesforce reports for people that are using that specific field which we make it a requirement in our demo form.

358
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,900
On how did you hear about us?

359
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,000
So I was just going to ask about that.

360
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:26,800
Yeah so you have to fill it out and there's a couple other questions as well, and we have been tweaking some things to see how it works.

361
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:34,100
If people at answer more favorably, if we do things, but we had the drop down box for so long and it was like as marketers.

362
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:49,100
We like to put people in boxes and when you hit when You go to a demo page and you hit that drop down box, more than likely you're in a click that first thing and it's usually like Google or something like that and like that's why everything gets attributed wrong and that's another whole conversation, honest.

363
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,900
That's right.

364
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:57,700
But yeah, Wow, that The Tick Tock point is so interesting to me because I am just curious.

365
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,700
Like, are those actually qualified leads that come through, are they B2B?

366
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:09,699
And yeah, I think I can tell you, I can tell you in the last two weeks, there's been, there's been two.

367
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,500
And one is from a 20,000 person company in our ICP.

368
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,900
In one is from a 4500 person company.

369
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:32,300
So for those people in Executives out there that say that Tick Tock is not for be I call BS and it's an absolute lie because I can prove that B2B should be on Tick Tock and should be producing content.

370
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,699
There.

371
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,800
Mmm.

372
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,300
That's really interesting.

373
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,300
What are your thoughts on Instagram?

374
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,699
Facebook Twitter, so, so Instagram.

375
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,199
All I am really doing with Instagram.

376
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,600
I am using Instagram, reels to repurpose, Tick-Tock content over there, and again, it's a different audience.

377
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:55,600
So, like the people that are following my Instagram reels have been Went from Tick-Tock have been different from LinkedIn, so it's cool.

378
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,300
It's like three different platforms.

379
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,900
I don't put anything on Twitter and Facebook.

380
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,700
I don't mess with anything with their either.

381
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:11,600
But the interesting thing is let us just say LinkedIn decides to kick us all off tomorrow, and we all go to LinkedIn.

382
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,100
Jill.

383
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,600
What happens?

384
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,200
You don't own the audience on any of these social media platforms, that's the issue.

385
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,000
Mark, like just every anyone thinks that like they own that audience.

386
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:47,400
So If LinkedIn kicks me off tomorrow, my 41 thought a thousand followers goes by, like I have nothing and so that's why I am now creating an email list because that is the one thing that you do own you create that email list which feeds into a newsletter which feeds into all these other channels for me personally and yeah, like I mean, it's my personal thing, not an ALICE thing but ultimately the brand still is associated with who I am.

387
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,100
That makes sense.

388
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,400
Wow, okay, so that's a ton of content creation.

389
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,800
I am on your side.

390
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,500
Do you have?

391
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:04,400
Like are you the one man Agency or how are you getting all the editing, the shooting, the writing previously done.

392
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,100
So it's all just me outside of the podcast.

393
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,800
The podcast, I do have a company that's been with me in Partnership for two years now.

394
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:22,200
But as far as like the LinkedIn creation, then taking that, and all I am really doing is say, I write a, I will get used today is an example.

395
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,300
I Needed, a text post around, 20 23 ideas.

396
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:32,100
For events that are in person ways that you could use product tours, things like that.

397
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,400
All I did was take my phone record myself repeating.

398
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,200
What that text post was?

399
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,400
Which takes me about five minutes maybe less than that.

400
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,700
It took me five minutes to write that post.

401
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,400
Five minutes to shoot the video.

402
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:52,500
I throw it into an app called captions, which will automatically put captions into it and then I just hit post on tick tock.

403
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,800
On Instagram rails and post on YouTube shorts.

404
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,000
In the whole thing.

405
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,700
Takes me 15, 20 minutes, max, nice.

406
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,600
Okay.

407
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,900
And then you have, like, a way of calendaring these out.

408
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,700
Like, how do you organize your content right now?

409
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,400
Yeah, I don't do it very well.

410
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,200
I can tell you that, I have always been the type of person that doesn't write anything down.

411
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:29,200
Like, I hate taking notes, like any of my And it's / like spur of the Mind type thing, like I will be usually in the shower and I will try to remember what it was.

412
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,200
By the time I got out of the shower to my phone, but I don't schedule anything out.

413
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:46,900
I don't write anything in advance unless I know I have to like post something specifically about ass like certain topic but like 99% of the time, it's just whatever comes to mind in.

414
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:55,200
Like, for me I am a very out overanalyze, and I am very indecisive, so, if it takes me longer More than five minutes to create any type of content.

415
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,900
I just won't do it because then I start to overanalyze, is this going to actually make sense?

416
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,100
And I am just like, who cares?

417
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,900
Like, if you read my stuff, like this, grammatical errors.

418
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:10,300
Luckily grammarly saved me a bit but like, I don't, yeah, I run on sentences all the time.

419
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:10,600
I don't care.

420
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,100
It's all about, just getting it out there.

421
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,500
That's a really key point of advice.

422
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:22,400
I think for Content creators anyone out there interested in getting into evangelism is like the analysis paralysis.

423
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:22,900
Cisco.

424
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,600
I think that happens.

425
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:31,000
So often with content creators where you're like, getting really nitpicking and then it's like, I don't know if I should even put this out.

426
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,100
And by that time, you have already over, thought the whole thing?

427
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah.

428
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:47,800
But it's so true and it's like, you start to hit backspace and like you write the same thing as 10 times and then 45 minutes passed and then you're like I am not even gonna post this time to frustrated right now, but like who cares?

429
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,300
Sometimes you just gotta send it.

430
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:57,100
Like whom, you know one thing I noticed the first time I am I posted content, is this always going to be people who don't like it and who cares?

431
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,300
That's why I made this hat.

432
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,200
That's why I made this.

433
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,000
I have a merch line and specifically around the creation.

434
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:10,900
Yeah, it's like haters hate creators create that's, there's always going to be people who hate what you do in this going to be people that tear you down, trolls that are out there.

435
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,700
Who cares?

436
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,300
Like don't let them get in your way and like that's what a lot of people.

437
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,500
There's so many mental barriers that people need to overcome, and they're afraid that people are going to not like what they say.

438
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,400
And that's okay.

439
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,200
Your content isn't going to be for everyone.

440
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:36,700
Just like yo Alice is content isn't going to be for everyone but it doesn't matter because it's going to reach the right people and that's what matters at the end of the day, so where can I go to get that hat, I will have to link you.

441
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,600
It's yeah, I have got hats, I have got hoodies.

442
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,200
It's I wear this everywhere.

443
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,700
Now drop the link in chat, so we can all get our hats and Sport your swag.

444
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,300
Absolutely, that's awesome.

445
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,300
So talking about content.

446
00:39:52,200 --> 00:40:01,300
If we go into your content strategy as an evangelist, like, how do you balance the content strategy that you work on?

447
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,200
Like, how do you think about that from a, like, a Content pillar perspective?

448
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:15,700
You know, Alice has its core product Services offerings and there's a key, you know, direction for that brand, but then there's your brand.

449
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,200
So how does that all work?

450
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,800
In determining prioritization.

451
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,100
And what Is like what's going to hit the mark with your audience's.

452
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:31,400
So I think you know the benefit are a fortunate thing is that the Alice brand is kind of like out there.

453
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:41,000
It's a fun brand like people like we're not like robots like even like when you look at the stuff from our corporate handle it's value-add it's like fun.

454
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,100
It's Christina.

455
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:51,400
Does a great job with like are like social media but like there's we don't try to be stuffy or something that were not and I think that's why it.

456
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,200
Me so well because that's how I am.

457
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,400
It's authentic.

458
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,900
And if you can't be authentic in the content that you create, people are going to see right through it.

459
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,600
Same as marketers.

460
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:10,200
It's like when someone prospects me, it hits a copy and paste job that anyone could see from a million miles away and then gets mad that you're not going to take a 30-minute meeting with them.

461
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,500
Like come on, do a little bit of research on me.

462
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:18,700
I give you all of this information on my LinkedIn and yet people still don't do research like in the last.

463
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,800
I would say two weeks.

464
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,300
I have gotten about 45.

465
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,900
Five prospecting emails and Linkedin.

466
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,200
DM's guess, how many of those have been personalized one?

467
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,300
And it's crazy because I give those all this information is in my LinkedIn profile.

468
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,900
If you just took five minutes of your time to check some things out, you know, I love baseball.

469
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:46,600
You know that I have a daughter, you know, I love New England Sports and that I am devastated about the Red Sox right now but people aren't doing that.

470
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,200
And so for me like the content that I create, it's all about authenticity.

471
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:51,800
Nicely.

472
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,100
And so, you know, good example, when I have been doing this for three years.

473
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,400
So, when I started three years ago, I only talked about field marketing, and I was the only one on LinkedIn.

474
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,000
The talked about field marketing on a consistent basis and what it actually meant to a revenue organization.

475
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,300
So think about that one person out of 650 million users at the time.

476
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,000
Crazy.

477
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:20,400
And then I started my podcast at the time, which was on personal branding and I started to talk more about that and I lost being associated with the marketer.

478
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,400
People would reach out to me and want to talk personal branding building an audience, but they didn't want to talk marketing.

479
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:33,200
And I was like, oh, man, that kind of devastates me because like, I feel like the content I want to create is really around marketing.

480
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,400
And so a couple months ago, I said, you know what, I feel like personal branding.

481
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:38,900
Yeah.

482
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:45,900
You should absolutely do it, but I said, I feel like it's so played out, like, you can't scroll LinkedIn more than five minutes without seeing a post around it.

483
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,800
And so, I said, I said to my production team that does my podcast.

484
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,300
I said, I want to end the podcast.

485
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,600
I want to create a new one.

486
00:42:52,800 --> 00:43:03,100
I want to get back to being known as a marketer, and I said, I am going to start to create content around customer marketing influencer marketing, Creator economy, interest Marketing, in general.

487
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,600
And I said, this will help me get back to being associated to a marketer.

488
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,100
And the new podcast is a marketing podcast.

489
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:18,100
And I feel like all of these things, it's starting to tip the tables a little bit more, and it's going to take a little bit of time.

490
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:25,000
But like I am trying to avoid talking about personal branding and building an audience, like, at least first.

491
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,100
I want it to be marketing first that second, mmm.

492
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,600
That's good.

493
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,800
Thanks for breaking that down.

494
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
We have a question that's relevant to this.

495
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:35,800
Let us pull up.

496
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,600
Spencer's, question, what's the best way to generate authentic content?

497
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,700
Whoo, yeah, conversations is definitely important.

498
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,800
Like, I feel like we're all working on projects and ultimately the best LinkedIn.

499
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:57,400
Is when you're sharing your experiences Lessons, Learned things that you're doing in your everyday life.

500
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:04,200
So that me as a marketer, if I see what you're doing, and I am like, who like and you talked about a failure or something like that.

501
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,500
I try to avoid those steps so that I am not making the same mistake.

502
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:14,600
Or if you're having a huge success, you're sharing that I am trying to replicate it myself to whatever process that I need.

503
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,400
And I feel like that is the most authentic content.

504
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:29,100
Like when people are sharing hey these are the five things that At I did that resulted in XYZ cool and I will give you another good example, cute.

505
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,700
I think it was cute to aq3.

506
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:38,800
I drove a bunch of G2 reviews, I think it was like, 83 that ultimately drove and I drove with 70 something in two days, and I am credible.

507
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,400
Thank you.

508
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:39,700
Yeah.

509
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,500
And I posted the entire Playbook on a LinkedIn post.

510
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,900
I said, this is the exact email I sent.

511
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,400
This is how I segmented the audience.

512
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,200
This is how I got the MPS.

513
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,000
This is literally the email and everything and it blew up.

514
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,900
It had almost 2,000 likes on it.

515
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,400
Hundreds of comments on it.

516
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,700
I got a lot of hate from G2 competitors.

517
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:16,800
Actually, people that tried to Blackmail me and like, tell me that I was doing like illegal that it was crazy, but ultimately that drove over 100,000 views with just one post.

518
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:30,000
Well, I feel like those types that type of content is something that I personally love to put out there in any role that I go building and public is incredibly important to me and like having a company support that.

519
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,600
And yeah I am not out there.

520
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:40,100
Sharing are you know, growth numbers or anything like that, but I am sharing exactly what I am working on and sharing it as much as I can.

521
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:45,400
Because I feel like that's going to help the next marketer, hopefully be in a better spot than they are today.

522
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,300
Wow, that's great.

523
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,000
You will have to share that g to review.

524
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,200
LinkedIn's post with us early, so we can pull that Playbook.

525
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,400
Wow, this is incredible.

526
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:02,800
So evangelism works as a channel for you and the, and we're seeing some direct Roi.

527
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,300
Direct Revenue come through.

528
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,900
Let us talk a little bit.

529
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,300
I know we have only got 15 minutes left, believe it or not.

530
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,300
Let us talk about customer marketing.

531
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,000
A little bit more.

532
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,500
You touched it at the beginning of our conversation.

533
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:31,900
And when you and I spoke prior to this convo, you're really unpacking some of the processes and like, how you work with the customer success team and how your structured organizationally with them?

534
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,300
Can you give us a little double?

535
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,000
Click into the customer marketing strategy?

536
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,200
Yeah, absolutely.

537
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:46,000
So I guess kind of little bit of background, so we went through a layoff a couple weeks ago and so marketing was a 10-person team down.

538
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:46,800
On 24.

539
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,700
So we have basically dissolved marketing and I report to our VP of Cs now.

540
00:46:52,700 --> 00:47:01,100
So I am incredibly aligned on the retention side of the business, the other members of the marketing team report to our VP of sales.

541
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,900
And that's another whole conversation.

542
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,500
I don't know if I personally believe with it, but it is what it is.

543
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:13,000
So, I am incredibly aligned to the programs that customer success is running.

544
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,400
I understand the process is, I understand I am literally, A huge part of their team.

545
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,200
And like, we all work really, really well together.

546
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,700
And so, for me, I try to break down what I am working on through three different things.

547
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,100
Really?

548
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:34,400
So customer communication emails and I, so I send them out from our VP of CS2, all yet.

549
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,600
End users on a bi-weekly basis.

550
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:48,600
I create the email for her, and I am really trying to keep these short and concise with the video from her and then kind of little bit about product updates or features or Things like that or things that they should know about.

551
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:59,600
I am actually I just wrote one today that's going out next week that kind of is like a year in rear interview, talks about all the Integrations, all the donations that we did, things like that.

552
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:10,400
So I am really excited about that and the feedback from customers has been through the roof one, the part of the issue is you can use in-app messaging which is awesome.

553
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:22,600
However, with our product specifically, we if you are using Integrations, you We don't need to go into Alice which means that in at messaging is only getting the 30 to 40% of our users.

554
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
Which what happens to the rest of them?

555
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,300
We weren't actually emailing anyone before that.

556
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,600
We were just relying on in-app messages.

557
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,800
So them hearing from us is a huge win.

558
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,500
The other piece is g 2 reviews.

559
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,400
Understand, social proof is incredibly important.

560
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:46,000
Plus all these gold nuggets that you can then pull out and start to use for the sales team for the Cs team start to figure.

561
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:51,900
Out what features in what use cases are more prevalent than not has been huge?

562
00:48:51,900 --> 00:49:01,300
And, so I mean in the last two quarters I think I have about 140 reviews into quarters.

563
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:07,200
That has given us tremendous feedback in tremendous results and it comes specifically for me.

564
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,500
So I record a video that says, hey I am I am asking for a GT review in exchange.

565
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:28,200
I am going to send you a gift, not a gift card because I think things should be But Power of Choice, you can use it if you exchange it for a gift card, if you want and I say email me back, if you want to give me feedback on the product, hop, on call, whatever.

566
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:39,600
And I can't tell you how many customers want to hop on a call, want to talk through things wanting to just get better insights, we were able to up sell a bunch of companies.

567
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:47,400
We were able to retain earlier in the contract companies that maybe we wouldn't have I have done till like later.

568
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,300
So that's another huge thing and then the third thing is the customer stories.

569
00:49:51,300 --> 00:50:08,200
So again, we had customer case studies, I feel like they were fluffy, and I am going to give you a good example because I like giving examples, Sixth Sense is a customer of ours, and so we released a story last fall and it said 6 and sees five hundred and thirty-seven percent ROI increase.

570
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,100
And as a marketer, I read that headline.

571
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,100
Is it click baby?

572
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,000
Maybe I didn't come up with it but I want to know exactly.

573
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,100
We how they did that.

574
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:27,000
What is the Tactical like step-by-step that they did to get that Roi because we serve a similar audience like I want to replicate that and it didn't talk about that.

575
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:35,800
And I said, you know what, when I took this rollover I said I want to redo these stories and I want to focus on the Tactical aspect, and so we have released four of them so far.

576
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:45,900
I am redoing the six cents, one, it's actually just in production right now should be coming out next week, but I can tell you it is very, very tactical, goes into their secrets.

577
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:53,800
Sauce, how they do everything, and I feel like these stories have been tremendous, because we're running paid ads around them.

578
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,800
Now, we're running them for our sales team in Cadence's.

579
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,500
It rbdr team RCS.

580
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,800
Team is leveraging them.

581
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,500
Our website, traffic has been through the roof.

582
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,000
Oh, no.

583
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,800
Did I disappear?

584
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,300
You did?

585
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:08,700
Hold on.

586
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,600
Sorry, it's all good.

587
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,400
It's your fancy setup over there.

588
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,000
I think I am that you could try refreshing.

589
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,800
That's weird.

590
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,800
Hold on, I don't know what that's never happened before.

591
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,100
There's your little Avatar.

592
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,300
Oh, most there, there you are.

593
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,200
That's weird.

594
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,400
That's never happened before.

595
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,500
Sorry about that.

596
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,100
Oh, it's all good.

597
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:53,900
Cool.

598
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,700
But yeah, that's, you know, that's, that's the base of what I am doing.

599
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:12,000
I am actually building on a customer Advisory board right now as well, because again, why be reactive in the feedback that you're getting, why not be proactive and seek this information out from your top customers.

600
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:18,800
So I have uh, I built a few versions of decks, and we're going to start to explore that as a 2023 initiative as well.

601
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:27,600
Love that there are some definite actionable strategic tactical points you offered here.

602
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,000
We have got about nine minutes left.

603
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,100
I did want to answer Janet's.

604
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,900
Got a question here.

605
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,800
And it has to do with employees.

606
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:41,100
How do you give your employees the parameters for posting content?

607
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,600
What do you think of AI for generating content?

608
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,900
So I don't think you should give parameters to employees for posting content honestly.

609
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:57,100
Because why would you want 30 employees saying the same exact thing that's just copy and pasted?

610
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:04,100
And I can tell you I did an in a vent and I started to get tagged the other day.

611
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:21,600
From about 20 employees that must have used some type of software and just clicked repost because it was literally the same wording from all of them in the same video clip and like yeah like that's cool but like you know there's no authenticity behind it's like you know someone's basically telling you.

612
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,500
This is what you have to post whereas with no parameters.

613
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,300
Hey like everything is fair game like yeah, talk about things that you're passionate about.

614
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,200
Ultimately, it's still going to impact the business.

615
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:43,900
I am not saying like don't go out and like, Not talk about the company to share cool stuff because ultimately people buy from people, and if you can showcase that and build relationships with people, that's going to be awesome.

616
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:54,600
On the AI side, I have been playing around with the chat G PT, 3 things, and it's interesting because I actually wrote I wrote anything.

617
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,200
I said, what does evangelism and be to be mean to you.

618
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,400
And I must have stumped it because I got like a blinking cursor.

619
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,500
That came back at me, and I was like, oh yeah, this thing is Going to steal my job.

620
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:12,900
I am not, I am not too worried so, but yeah, I mean, it's honestly it's way better than anything that's out there right now.

621
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:27,800
I can tell you that, like, I have used it for I am seeing like Tick Tock videos that Engineers are using it to basically like figure out like coding and all it just basically writes code for you and like all these other things, I think it's going to be really cute cool.

622
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:33,600
But I don't think you should 100% rely on it because it goes back to your point of authenticity, right?

623
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:41,200
And at some point, I mean, the challenge is some of these AI generated content pieces to feel authentic.

624
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,500
But then, at some point you can start to see, like, oh, is this a?

625
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,900
I generated like, as a person, consuming the content, I will question it.

626
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,500
You know, actually so awesome.

627
00:54:52,500 --> 00:55:02,200
All right, well, I would love to close our time with a point of advice or encouragement that you have for the B2B community.

628
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:03,800
Yeah.

629
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:15,100
It's you know, I would say going back to my new pad podcast, which is called the anonymous marketer people submit questions anonymously, like the it's not about the right or the wrong answer.

630
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:22,500
It's about starting a conversation for the B2B marketing community and I would say, don't be afraid to ask these questions.

631
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:29,800
I feel like so many people when the pandemic happened, they turned to communities, and they were asking questions in there because they didn't want to be judged by the companies.

632
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,500
They worked for now.

633
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,800
There's so many of your colleagues in bosses that are in these communities as well.

634
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,600
People are still feeling uncomfortable.

635
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:47,400
So I wanted to start something that allows people to create anonymous questions and hopefully myself and a guest can dive into this.

636
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,800
And a good example, I am releasing the first episode next week, but it's around career growth.

637
00:55:53,100 --> 00:56:01,800
And one of the questions I got was it's so hard to find a mentor if, especially, if you're not in a big city, like Boston, New York or San Francisco.

638
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,400
How do I go about?

639
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:02,700
Out.

640
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,100
Finding a mentor because I feel like I need one.

641
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,700
And it was like, that's so many people are dealing with that as a marker.

642
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,900
It hits home because I haven't had a mentor up until a couple few years ago.

643
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,300
I didn't know where to turn.

644
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:18,300
No one told me where to go, find him our mentor and then the second question was around.

645
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,100
I actually feel like I know more than my boss at this point.

646
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,600
What do I do?

647
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:31,700
I could sit here in Coast for another year, but I feel like I am doing myself a disservice by doing that and I feel like that's again.

648
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:36,000
I mean I have been in That spot where I feel like I knew more than my boss but like what do you do?

649
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,100
If there's no other ways to go around like you're just kind of stuck there.

650
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:52,900
Yeah you could Coast but it's we go deep on to these types of questions and I think it's going to be really helpful for B2B marketers to kind of explore like hey this is impactful for me.

651
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,300
In this does help me in my career.

652
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,700
Disappear again.

653
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,200
Right, next.

654
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:07,900
We lost your video again, but we could still hear you say, okay, your podcast is coming out.

655
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,900
Is it next week?

656
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,400
Yeah.

657
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,300
Next Wednesday.

658
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:10,700
Yep.

659
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:11,400
The 14.

660
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,400
Hey, okay.

661
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:18,300
So we will be looking out on your LinkedIn for any updates or whoa.

662
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,100
That's, I don't know.

663
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:25,100
Fact, Got to get it.

664
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,200
Get some of that techno music going.

665
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,500
Yeah, all right.

666
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,200
Well we're at time anyway, Nick.

667
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:41,400

00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,400

00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,700
I definitely appreciate it.

673
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,800
Awesome.

674
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:08,400
All right, so with that, thank you for joining our time.

675
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,600
We have our next event taking place this coming Wednesday actually.

676
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,100
And Nick is going to be on again.

677
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:19,400
We're really on this customer marketing topic.

678
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,500
You were pulling this thread, very deep.

679
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:26,700
We have also got Serena director of customer Stammer marketing from qualified will be joining.

680
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:33,800
It's gonna be a rich discussion so definitely join us then and then Thursday I don't have a screen up.

681
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:45,400
We have got an interview Spotlight with Kevin Lee who's the SVP of marketing at oyster, and he's got a lot to share on plg brand strategy as well as leading remote teams.

682
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,200
Well going into 2023 have a wonderful rest of your day.

683
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,700
We will catch you next time.

684
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:24,200
I played my drum for would invite my bumper, I played my best for him.

1
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,500
Did a full 180 crazy?

2
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:28,600
Walk away, you know how don't talk and don't you good?

3
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,800
Anything could stop me.

4
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,300
The ox and lamb kept time for the rubber bumper.

5
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:58,100
I played my drum for him but I played my best for him.

6
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,600
Hello, everyone.

7
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:52,800
It's great to be with you today, and nice to see you tuning in from all over the world.

8
00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Literally, we got folks from Puerto Rico to Colombia, to Cape Cod Seattle, and I am here in Ewa Beach Hawaii.

9
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a beautiful day to be alive today, so I am really excited about today's panel.

10
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,400
I have got some of the best customer marketers.

11
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,600
Who will be talking today about customer retention and why this is such a critical thing?

12
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,800
You know, there was a recent stat that came out from Bain & Company research that a 5% increase in customer.

13
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:36,400
Retention can actually increase profits by 25 to 95% what a mind-blowing stat right there.

14
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,600
So, especially as we're moving into 2023, we know, budgets are getting tighter, we have to be better.

15
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,000
Better stewards of the business overall.

16
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,600
It makes sense to double down.

17
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,100
And so we have got the best here and I would love to introduce to our stage.

18
00:10:51,300 --> 00:11:00,200
Nick Bennett director of evangelism and custom marketing analysis and Serena director of customer marketing at qualified.

19
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,500
Hi.

20
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,100
Hi, everyone.

21
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,900
How's it going?

22
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,800
How's it going?

23
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,800
Good to see you, both.

24
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,300
How are you doing well, doing?

25
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,600
Well, happy holidays.

26
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,600
Happy holidays.

27
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,400
So, just to get a quick check here, we're all tuning in from just want to put up this map where Serena year.

28
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,800
Okay, you're an Oakland.

00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,600
I am an England.

30
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:29,900
Yeah.

31
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,400
Right.

32
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,600
Right.

33
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,700
Outside of San Francisco.

34
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,500
In the East Bay.

35
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,300
Nice and Nick.

36
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,200
We see your tuning in from Boston.

37
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,500
Yes, yes, it's cold like that.

38
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,500
Oh, it's freezing.

39
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,000
It's actually snowed the other day, and I was not ready for that.

40
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,500
Okay.

41
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,000
Gotcha.

42
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,700
Serena, how's the weather for you?

43
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,800
You know, it's a little warmer not snowing here but yeah, probably in the 50s.

44
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,900
So staying warm.

45
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,900
Nice.

46
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,400
Nice.

47
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,300
I can't complain.

48
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,900
It's run 70 over here.

49
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,400
So Contrast temperatures.

50
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,200
Awesome.

51
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:16,100
Well, before we kick off, you know, would love to talk just a little bit about each of you and get to know each of you a little more with our fun facts.

52
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,000
So I am going to start off with my fun fact.

53
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,000
It's not exactly me.

54
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,400
But it's my husband who actually used to do a doo-wop group with Bruno, Mars.

55
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,400
So the two in the middle right there.

56
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,500
Bruno, Mars is in the middle left.

57
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,000
And my husband Duane is to the right of him.

58
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:45,700
And this was their doo-wop group base is seeing all around the Honolulu hotels, and they say, do Ops with Boys to Men and all these other tracks.

59
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,500
But yeah, I am gonna hand it over to you, Nick.

60
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,100
What's your fun fact?

61
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:57,900
Yeah, for me it's I still play baseball competitively, so I am 35 and I can still hang with a lot of those 18 year olds.

62
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,700
Nice.

63
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,400
Where?

64
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,500
What?

65
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,200
Position.

66
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,800
Do you play?

67
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,000
I am a picture.

68
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,100
I am a lefty pitcher, and I actually come out of high school.

69
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:15,600
I used to throw almost 90 miles an hour, and I was on the way to a D1 scholarship and I blew out my arm.

70
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,800
Unfortunately.

71
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:24,000
And, so I was told I needed Tommy John surgery and for anyone that knows like, I am not going to the pros.

72
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,800
I was like, you know what, I am just ready to go to school.

73
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,700
Play some baseball with a weaker arm and get my degree and move on.

74
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:32,500
WOW.

75
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,400
Wow, didn't know you're moving towards.

76
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:35,700
Do you want?

77
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,400
And that's pretty big deal.

78
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,100
All right, handing it over to you.

79
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,900
Serena.

80
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,100
What's your fun fact?

81
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,700
So my fun fact is I am a twin I have got a twin sister named Karina.

82
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,600
Yes, those names.

83
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,500
Rhyme just closer to you and Nick she's over in New York but that's a photo of us at dreamforce.

84
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,500
We're hugging Astro, love, love me some Astro.

85
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,100
And then I think you have got another photo.

86
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:12,900
Figured I would YouTube since we're Twins and given of course this season, you have got little Serena and Karina in matching snow attire because twin parents love doing that.

87
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,200
So, yeah, speaking of twin parents got a call it out Nick, I am.

88
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Yeah, I am actually having twin girls and I already have a four-year-old daughter, so I am going to be officially really outnumbered in a couple more months.

89
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,400
So congrats.

90
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,400
Well, they have natural rhyming names.

91
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:44,600
Nick know I will, so we're at the point now where we're trying to see my daughter's name is Reese, and we're trying to say, do we do now go all our names but like, we're just like a whatever.

92
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,700
It's like at this point we're just taking it day by day.

93
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,500
That's awesome.

94
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,400
We got the twinsies connections all around here.

95
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,400
Cool.

96
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,000
Well, jump diving right into our discussion here.

97
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So, as I mentioned earlier, customer marketing is going to be a huge priority for a lot of teams, moving into 2023.

98
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,300
But there's a lot of questions still around processes and like how do you define it?

99
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:21,100
So I just wanted to hear from each of you, how do you define customer marketing and What are some of those pillar programs?

100
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:25,800
Awesome.

101
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
I will go first.

102
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,700
So, how I Define customer marketing is really understanding our customers stories, how they're leveraging our products.

103
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,300
And then, of course, how we bring those stories to life, across our different marketing channels, they think that's sort of the core of it.

104
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,100
Yeah, and I would say, for me, you know, and I am not a customer marketer per se.

105
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,000
Like, I have been doing this for like, five months, but I am a traditional field marketer and ABM marketer.

106
00:15:52,400 --> 00:16:02,000
And, so I have always understood the customer for me, the way that I view it is, how can customer marketing support retention, and for us, we call it t TV.

107
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,800
So, time to value, and the board has put so much pressure on us to deliver High retention numbers from a net revenue.

108
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,600
Tension.

109
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:22,800
And so all the focus is there right now and honestly it's been really interesting to think about it for someone that has not specifically run customer marketing programs for years.

110
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,100
And I have relied so much on the customer marketing Community to bounce ideas.

111
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,000
Off of, it's been really refreshing.

112
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:42,100
And when you each describe, like just some basic pillar programs of what can customer marketing can consist of what does that look like for qualified and Alice?

113
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:44,800
Yes, I do.

114
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,400
Oh God, go ahead make.

115
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:54,200
I was going to say, you know, so I break it down into like five buckets and so when I think about like, how can we actually support that?

116
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,700
So internal enablement, how do we enable and educate our csm's?

117
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:05,099
And so that's a big one because they're the ones that are on the front lines that are talking to the customers every day and being a failed marketer.

118
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,500
I always partnered really close with the sales team.

119
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,700
I was the closest member of marketing to the sales team and it was a very much, a two-way street so internal.

120
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:14,599
Moment.

121
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:20,400
Huge, especially when you don't have an enablement resource to when I think of like new customers again.

122
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,200
It's like how do you reduce time to Value?

123
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,000
So like for us we are gifting company.

124
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:30,400
How do we get that time for them to send their first 20 gifts within a 30-day window?

125
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:45,000
Because if you're signing a one-year contract and it's taking you three months to get out of onboarding, you really only have nine months to see value and then who knows, these things that pop up and then renewal time And it's like, well on.

126
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,500
I didn't even get as much value out of this.

127
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,400
I need longer.

128
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,600
So reducing time to value for new, customers from all customers.

129
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,300
It's how do you increase?

130
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,500
The use case adoption.

131
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,900
So for me, it's like, how do I Inspire and educate customers on how to use gifting and creative ideas?

132
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:08,800
And it's probably why I join so many calls to ideate, and there's strategize with customers and Prospects.

133
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:15,000
But the customer side, those relationships should really start at the prospect level and Then you will at risk.

134
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,600
So obviously churn is Big right now, budget concerns from a marketing perspective.

135
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,000
How can we identify customers that risks way earlier, how can we run?

136
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,500
Proactive Outreach to them and then high-performing customers on the flip side, how do you actually turn those into Advocates?

137
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:39,800
So that they are the ones that are ultimately driving a ton of inbound business, on the acquisition side, Yeah, right.

138
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,200
So I would say on the qualified side you touched on a lot of the pillar programs that we offer as well.

139
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,900
So we're thinking about website content so that's in the form of case studies.

140
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:56,400
We Do videos, we do a lot of Photography along with quotes and stats were thinking about sales enablement, constantly.

141
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:05,900
I think that's a big portion of my job as well as making sure that our reps are knowledgeable about the stories that we have and are able to communicate those stories to prospects, as well as customers.

142
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,700
So that's usually in the form of story, slides, we have quote slide It's we do slide recordings, email, templates, all of that.

143
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,300
And then I would also say social is a big channel for us.

144
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,700
We're promoting these stories, these quotes these successes on organic as well as paid.

145
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,100
And we're also doing a lot of events and webinars like this webinar.

146
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,300
But yeah, we also are just starting to kick off an MVP program.

147
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,500
So really elevating.

148
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:38,900
Those customers that are considered true Champions really making sure that they're understanding how to use the product inside and out so that we can help too.

149
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,500
Scale, our CSM team, that's great.

150
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,100
Thanks for breaking that down.

151
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:50,100
If anybody has questions, feel free to drop it in Q&A, and we will be sure to pull those up.

152
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,400
So that's really helpful to understand the breakdown of each of these pillars.

153
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:02,100
Now we talked when we think of the actual onboarding experience after the post sale with a customer.

154
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,300
What does that process look like of hand off with customer success?

155
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,800
And when Does customer marketing come in and get introduced.

156
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,700
How do they get introduced?

157
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:18,500
Like what can you walk me through that introduction point of customer marketing with the customer?

158
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,100
Yeah, no.

159
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,700
I am happy too.

160
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:31,000
So for us something that we like to do is we like to include a publicity Clause within the contract.

161
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,700
So we know right off the bat whether or not this is a customer that's open to doing co-marketing.

162
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:44,000
So I think that's a really important first step for us and then I would say just as we're signing, a customers, something that we like to do is what we call a win announcement.

163
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,200
So, you know, we have got this great customer.

164
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,600
They have decided to partner with us.

165
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,300
Let us make a big splash about that.

166
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:59,200
I think that's a really sort of nice way to start the relationship and then from there, we generally partner with customers that are seeing success.

167
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,200
So whether that's after 6 months, time frame were checking in with dark USA.

168
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,300
Team to understand which customers are seeing success, which customers are really leveraging.

169
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,700
Our platform to the Max and understanding who those true Champions are getting those introductions.

170
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:22,700
And then meeting with those customers, doing those kickoff calls, understanding their stories understanding In what marketing opportunities they're interested in.

171
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,800
I think that's a really important step as well because you want to make sure these relationships are mutually beneficial.

172
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,700
So understanding what opportunities they get excited about.

173
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,200
Whether that's speaking whether that's sharing their story in the form of a case, study or a video.

174
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,100
Those are things we like to cover.

175
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:43,700
And then of course, in that same conversation, understanding their use case and really getting into the nitty-gritty of their story.

176
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,700
And then from there, being able to leverage that content in a lot of different ways.

177
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:59,800
And do you generally meet with a customer right upon within the first 30 days of their onboarding, or what's like a good amount of time from the point of post-sale onboarding?

178
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:06,800
Yeah, I think they're interested in doing when announcements where generally getting introduced within the first 30 days.

179
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,200
But, typically, I would say it's after, after they were seeing value, so for us, that's anywhere from for six to eight months.

180
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,200
Nick.

181
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,000
Any thoughts to add?

182
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,700
So I actually report to our VP of Cs which is interesting.

183
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:39,000
So like, I actually don't report to marketing right now per se, but I am incredibly aligned to our customer success team and it's actually the team that has grown most out of any team within the last.

184
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,900
I would say six months.

185
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,300
Or so, we have actually moved a lot of people in the acquisition side over to the CSI.

186
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,600
In our account management side as well.

187
00:22:47,800 --> 00:23:02,000
And you know we so for us it's a little bit easier because we're marketing to marketers, and so we're marketing to people that are exactly like me that have been looking to solve these pain points for the last you know 10 years of my career.

188
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:08,700
So I can relate, and I am usually connected to them, or we been in different like same circles.

189
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:15,400
It's easier to have those conversations which usually for us happen even before they become a customer.

190
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:26,200
Um, because I probably talked to them at the prospect bubble, I probably sent them some type of gift made them feel kind of like, you know, vip-style specially to our Target accounts.

191
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,600
Now, it's a closed deal.

192
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,400
So again I am usually jumping on in having strategy calls around like a b x.

193
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,900
How do we like they want to go gifting in their outbound strategy for a VM?

194
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:45,400
And I talked about that, or I was actually on a call yesterday with the customer that is rolling out a brand-new customer marketing.

195
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,800
Ting program that utilizes gifting into their entire flow.

196
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And so it was more so like, hey, like how do you do this internally?

197
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And then how can I replicate that?

198
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,200
And so, it's jumping on a lot of those calls.

199
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,900
The customer stories is huge for us, as well.

200
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:10,800
I actually went through the process of redoing these, so I am calling them more playbooks now where it's a very tactical.

201
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,800
Hey you drove five hundred percent ROI increase using a How did you actually do it?

202
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,300
What are the programs you ran?

203
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,600
What are the screenshots from your dashboards?

204
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:28,100
And we get super tactical into delivering that, which not only uses us, or benefits us from a retention side for other customers.

205
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,100
It actually drives a ton of acquisition growth as well.

206
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:40,800
So we're using a kind of from both sides and for me, you don't my hundred percent of my focus isn't on customer marketing, it's also on the evangelism piece.

207
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:54,200
So I would say that there's really nice parallels between the two Lee because ultimately, you want to create your customers to be Advocates and evangelist for you out in the community and dark, social and word-of-mouth.

208
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,100
And all those beautiful things, your customers are kind of speaking about the experience that they had.

209
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,600
But yeah.

210
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:07,400
So you know, I am doing a lot of these different pieces that ultimately happen before the handoff and then through the handoff as well.

211
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,700
I feel like I have the beauty to be able to see it across the entire Journey.

212
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:12,800
Hmm.

213
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,200
What would each of you say?

214
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,600
As far as your programs that you have mapped out?

215
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:25,700
What's like the one thing that's really working right now, who I can jump in on this one.

216
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,800
So for us, it's G2 reviews, social proof is huge in.

217
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:42,100
I went through the process, I wrote a LinkedIn post about this couple months ago, but I was able to drive it was ultimately 83 reviews and like two weeks but I throw I drove 73.

218
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:49,100
In two days and it was incredible and I basically gave my playbook away for free of how I did this.

219
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,700
So, how did you do that?

220
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,300
Yeah, and it was, it was more.

221
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,300
So again it was a video in message coming from me.

222
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,800
Marketed a marketer that was talking about.

223
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:04,200
Hey listen, you're always being you know, gifted like why don't I gift you something in exchange for this?

224
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,800
Now, people are going to be like, well, listen, you're incentivizing people for review.

225
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,800
Absolutely.

226
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,900
If you're, if you're a marketer and you're not doing this, you're an Idiot.

227
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
But it's Pete.

228
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,800
You're not incentivizing people for a positive review.

229
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:27,800
You're incentivizing people for feedback and I think that's the piece that gets missed, because I got a lot of hate because people are like, you're incentivizing people.

230
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,900
Yeah, absolutely.

231
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:39,500
I want to thank someone for their time for giving feedback on how we can improve our roadmap for the future and it was honestly, one of the biggest things that we saw.

232
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:48,500
When the G2 some reports came out, We saw like number one ranking in so many reports, and it was something where I was like, cool.

233
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:57,300
I can just replicate this process now, month, over month versus waiting till the last month of the quarter when they're like, hey, you need to get all your D2 reviews in by this time.

234
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,100
And it's been a huge driver for us because then what I did was I took all those G2 reviews and I bucketed them into use cases.

235
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,200
So ABM events, customer marketing.

236
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:15,400
And I really kind of took out the gold pieces from those quotes and I fed it to the sales team to the Cs team.

237
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,900
So now they have all these use cases that they can use when they're talking to additional people as well.

238
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,600
That's awesome.

239
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,300
Serena any thoughts to the one thing that's really working?

240
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,400
Yeah, I think one thing, we're doing that's a little more out of the box is something.

241
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,100
We're calling customer appreciation day.

242
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,000
So these are days of the year that we actually bring customers into our office.

243
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
We did this during dreamforce and it worked really, really well because we had so many of those Mutual customers in San Francisco and our office just happens to be two blocks from us.

244
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,400
Coney.

245
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,400
So we were able to bring I think close to 30 customers in over the course of those three days.

246
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,200
We captured quotes from those customers.

247
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,000
During that time we captured We have them in our studio as well as video interviews.

248
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,200
And so, coming out of that, we had just all these fantastic assets.

249
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,000
We were able to repurpose and feature across our website across social many different places.

250
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And I think it was just fantastic.

251
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:17,200
Not only from the content production perspective but also being able to meet with all those customers in person.

252
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:25,100
We got to meet them build those relationships in person, we got to introduce them to folks in our office as well as our Executives.

253
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:31,500
And we Also use that day as an opportunity to host executive briefing Center beings with our Executives.

254
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
So there was a lot of excitement in the office.

255
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:41,800
There was a lot of great energy so it was just fantastic and so much so that we're now doing those on a quarterly basis.

256
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:56,200
Oh wow, whatcha do you both also have customer advisory boards and is that experience woven into an in-person experience like that or virtual experience Yes.

257
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:09,000
I would say it's something we have talked about it's not necessarily something we have done yet, something we are playing around with is something we call our early adopter program.

258
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:19,400
So that's rolling out new features to a select group of customers and having them play around with it, give us feedback that then we feed into our product team.

259
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,600
I would say, that's probably the extent of that type of strategy at this point.

260
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,100
Yeah, we're similar, we actually don't have an actually just created version.

261
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:34,000
One of like a customer Advisory Board deck for 2023 and mapped out.

262
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What that exactly.

263
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Looks like the benefits who I think should be included based on, like all of the data that we have, but we are targeting to kind of it would be a quarterly thing but it would be a virtual component in April and then in person component, in September at something yo, really bringing everyone together to do something like a really elevated experience.

264
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,900
But again, we haven't done it before and I think these customer advisory boards.

265
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:12,800
Help you become so much more proactive versus reactive when it comes to the roadmap and establishing those relationships that it's honestly, it's, I wish we did it earlier.

266
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,600
Gotcha.

267
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,100
Wow.

268
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:22,400
Okay, question, I have next is around attribution and kpis.

269
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,600
How are each of you reporting back?

270
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,000
The, the kpis what does attribution look like for customer marketing?

271
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,500
Woohoo.

272
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:41,100
Yeah it's a good question because I feel like we're still like looking at it or trying to look at it a certain way.

273
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:50,300
So we use you know, we don't really have an upsell version of our product but that is part of it, it's more influence Revenue that comes from it.

274
00:30:50,400 --> 00:31:12,000
I am more measured on like the Evangelist side as well for like you know hey self-reported attribution What specifically comes in that is mentioning my name or additional pieces that we can tie back to the efforts that I am driving on social media or in person events, or if someone comes and fills out a demo today, they say, hey, I saw you on this welcome event.

275
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Awesome, cool.

276
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:21,200
We can report that back and again that starts the relationship, ultimately, bridging out into the customer side of things but I do.

277
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,800
Look at like hey I have I wanted to get a certain number of playbooks out before the end of the year.

278
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,700
Certain number of G2 reviews, certain number of MPS surveys, things like that.

279
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:40,000
Like, you know, it's we do look at it but it's not as scrutinized as you know, some of the other roles.

280
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Yeah, I would say that's probably the piece of most customer marketing programs, that folks struggle with the attribution piece of it just because it is so difficult to sort of map out.

281
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:04,700
I would say, you know, it's next Point, there's a lot of things that were measured on in terms of output in terms of performance, you know, number of pieces of content that we produce across case, studies videos slides Etc.

282
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:10,600
But yeah, the attribution piece is less obvious and it's one that we're actually just starting to tackle.

283
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:18,400
And so what we're doing is we're starting by building out campaigns within Salesforce where then attaching those two part at retarget.

284
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:37,800
Links, I am then going to get those links into the hands of sales, so that when they do start to share case studies, slides videos with customers and Prospects that we're able to then track who's actually opening those links and who's viewing that content and then being able to Target those folks directly because we have got all that living in Salesforce.

285
00:32:38,500 --> 00:33:03,700
But yeah, beyond that I think you know the one place where we Really start to get some, some good progress there was that Salesforce and what sort of model we set up was you know if there was an introduction that was made through someone within customer marketing where we got connected to a customer and then you know, as a result of them attending an event or you know, doing some type of co-marketing with us, you know?

286
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:12,100
We could say okay great that was a relationship that marketing had started and if they were attached to a future opportunity than that was something we could.

287
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Claim credit for.

288
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,200
But I would say that was sort of the one place where we had a pretty strong model in place.

289
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,900
Now, as far as pipeline influence or anything that, you know, you currently are seeing.

290
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:43,100
Like Nick, I have heard you talk about the significant pipeline influence that even your evangelist evangelism side has had, could you each of you speak to just how the performance is as far as just from an influence standpoint for each of your Despite efforts?

291
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,100
Yeah, I can kick things off so it's, you know.

292
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
So again, self-reported attribution.

293
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,100
So we make it a required field.

294
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,700
When you fill out our demo for movies movie, made that switch back in October of 2021.

295
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Insights that we got into, which communities, we should be partnering with which channels are actually working organic was actually our biggest driver of all pipeline in 2022.

296
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,199
It's by a staggering number and marketing actually.

297
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:18,400
70% of the pipeline right now for what we have done through November of 2022.

298
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:29,699
Now, you know, when I use self-reported attribution and people specifically call out my name, I pull, I have a report in Salesforce that I can pull and kind of get this info, and so I will do.

299
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:38,699
I am on track to do a million dollars in pipeline myself this year, with about a 60 maybe a little bit higher than 60% close rate on top of that.

300
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,199
So just think about that one person.

301
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:43,400
And it's why I think that at the Creator economy.

302
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:49,500
As we move into 2023, it's going to be so crucial because ultimately we know people buy from people.

303
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:57,300
And if you can be a relatable person, someone that people want to build relationships with and get in, you provide value through the content that you create.

304
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:05,900
They may not have a need right now, but I can guarantee you when there is a need, they're going to remember you and they're gonna be like, hey, I am gonna at least put you in the conversation.

305
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,700
Then it's up to the sales team and product and all those other things to make it happen.

306
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,400
But it's about being That conversation to just get there because again, like Mar Tech.

307
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,900
It's so crowded right now in sales Tech as well and budgets are being cut.

308
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,800
Layoffs are happening every single day.

309
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,900
Why should someone say I am going to spend 20,000 dollars on Alice when I could go by Amazon gift cards off?

310
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,300
Amazon, just send it to people?

311
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,700
Like, why do I need a platform?

312
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:40,700
And so again, it's building those relationships, both virtually in person through content.

313
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,000
And again, I create intent on a lot of different platforms through events to podcast.

314
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:55,100
I just released my first episode of my new podcast today, that is a marketing podcast and so all these channels will amplify everything else that we're running internally as well.

315
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,400
So that's just kind of some thoughts.

316
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:06,200
I have the I think it's going to be, I think short form content is going to be huge in 2023 and then the Creator economy and B2B is going to be another thing.

317
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,200
Great points Bill and Chad is asking for your link to your podcast.

318
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:21,300
So please drop that when you get a moment Serena handing it over to you, any thoughts?

319
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,500
Yeah.

320
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,300
So I think it's really taking advantage of those opportunities when we meet with our customers.

321
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,500
So when we're bringing them into the office, and we're doing those customer appreciation days.

322
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,600
You know, they also have the opportunity to meet with our product team.

323
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:41,200
And so we have had a number of those conversations happen in person where they're actually getting Live demos of different products they haven't seen before.

324
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,300
And, so I think that's really been a great way to spike that interest.

325
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:52,000
Also, I mentioned the edc's, it's another opportunity to kind of understand like where the gaps are within the different products.

326
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,400
They're leveraging on our platform and then getting them into a room to actually speak with the products, you would be Executives and help them paint that vision and get those demos.

327
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,600
So, so powerful and then I think also, another great opportunity is dreamforce.

328
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,200
You know, we were sponsors this year.

329
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,900
We had sessions, we had a Both within the campground.

330
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,100
And so again, when we're able to just meet with those people in person and really show them how it works.

331
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,400
I think that's really the eye-opening piece of it.

332
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:34,100
And of course, in each of those sessions, we had our customers, tell their stories, you know, shared the stage with our speakers and it was just fantastic because you know, I think it's one thing when qualified says we're able to do something, but when you hear it from the mouth of our customers, it's so much more meaningful.

333
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,700
So we found those strategies to work very well.

334
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,800
Common denominators, I am hearing from both of you.

335
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:49,200
Is just the value of the relationship building opportunities that you're having as we're moving into this Creator economy with short-form content bite-sized.

336
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,300
So on so forth.

337
00:37:50,400 --> 00:38:04,700
What's going to sustain and keep bringing people back to your brand, is ultimately that relationship and Richard, you're calling it right here in chat where it's the reinforcement of the importance of brand relationships on sales and marketing.

338
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,500
So I think each of you guys are describing that going into Q&A, here we go.

339
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:15,500
Some questions trickling in Norma Hogan, is asking, Nick said he's under CS.

340
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,100
What about Serena is this a marketing role or a cs1?

341
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,800
Good question, a great question, I would say, you know, having done customer marketing at 5 plus companies.

342
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,600
Now generally sits under product marketing and when you think about that, it makes a lot of sense.

343
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:38,500
You know, you want your customer marketer to be able to understand the product to help customers explain the product in a way that's meaningful.

344
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,800
All that inspires others.

345
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,600
And so yeah it's typically been product marketing for me.

346
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
Yeah, I was I was going to add something to that.

347
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,200
So you know we actually just went through a reorg probably about a month or so ago.

348
00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:06,900
So I actually did sit under our VP of marketing but it's now got shifted, where some of the members of marketing that are left report to our VP of sales and growth or revenue or whatever, they're calling it now.

349
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:15,000
And then I because I am so focused on retention so under the VP of Cs but it was under marketing as well before.

350
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,900
Uh, so I just wanted to call that out.

351
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:26,700
Alright, another question here from Andrea do either of you have customer events planned in 2023 in person?

352
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:33,800
Roundtables product, service training series, customer appreciation dinners, Yes, 100%.

353
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,400
We have got incredible events, team.

354
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,100
Shout out to Jackie and Amy.

355
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,900
They're fantastic.

356
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,300
We just given our customer base and our product.

357
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,100
We partner very closely with the Salesforce events.

358
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,400
So, we're at dreamforce.

359
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,200
We're at the world tours, you will find us there.

360
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,900
And with each of those events were doing dinners the night before typically before the event.

361
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:01,200
And we're inviting, you know, key prospects and customers to those dinners to meet in person to be able to have Roundtable.

362
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,300
Shins around product and challenges.

363
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,900
They're seeing out there that hopefully we can help address.

364
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,900
So that's one thing we're doing.

365
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,500
We also have a series called Taste of qualified where we invite prospects and customers virtually to join us for wine.

366
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,500
Tasting, will usually have a featured winery.

367
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,100
That's pouring, the wine.

368
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,500
And we have shipped them, the wine in advance.

369
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,000
That's a lot of fun as well.

370
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:30,100
I would say, that's more on the event side and then, of course, the events that I am running from the, the customer marketing side is those customer appreciation days.

371
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:43,700
We talked about We're also just kicking off our MVP programs, so we will be going quarterly to meet with those MVPs in person, we have identified the top cities, they're based in, so we will be hosting those in person.

372
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,800
Meetups to do some product education, as well as some customer marketing.

373
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:57,900
So we will be doing photography, photography video, as well as interviews and two out of four of those events are aligned with Salesforce events Amazing.

374
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Yeah, any thoughts Nick to add?

375
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,800
Yeah, I mean we definitely plan to do some things.

376
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,300
We are very limited team right now with four people down from 10.

377
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:16,600
So we're cutting back on a lot of our efforts mostly from a like bigger event standpoint.

378
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:37,600
However, I am a big believer in small curated elevated experiences, both VIP experiences for your customers but also from The prospect level because I think that the amount of micro content short-form content that you can ultimately create from that and repurposing redistribute at scale is incredibly important.

379
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,600
So it's something that I definitely plan to do it.

380
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,300
Just it's going to be a lot less than what we initially expected.

381
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,000
And that's real.

382
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,800
It's probably real for a lot of companies right now.

383
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,600
So I appreciate both perspectives there.

384
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,400
Richard has a question for us.

385
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:05,000
The number one, Pitfall you see in today's customer marketing World, whether that is over or under prioritizing certain initiatives and ideas.

386
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:17,900
Yeah, I mean, I feel like it's for us like we're trying to do less honestly, it's tough when you are a Very stretched team.

387
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,200
Why do 10 different things?

388
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,900
Like, there's like 10 15, 20 different things.

389
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:28,800
I want to do, but they're going to be half asked if I do them because we don't have the resources to be able to support that.

390
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,800
So, why not do 567 things?

391
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:46,500
Really, really well, and be proud of that, and so I think for me like I am okay with doing less and it sounds weird saying that because like I am not usually that type of person, but I think the quality over quantity.

392
00:42:46,700 --> 00:43:03,100
A station starts to come in and it becomes a lot more imperative to be like, listen, I did these six things but honestly, they drove tons of business, tons of renewals early, renewals all these things and you feel really proud of it versus saying, I did these 15 different things and seven of them flopped.

393
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,200
So that's just a couple of my thoughts.

394
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:14,500
Yeah, I would say for me it's you know now that we have got sort of this content engine built, we were pumping out case studies were pumping out videos.

395
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:22,900
I really want to start focusing on the next phase of that so it's focusing on how sales is actually using the content is that's making a difference.

396
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,500
I want you know, we talked about attribution that's something I really want to figure out next year.

397
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,900
And so, for me, something I am starting to do is actually go into Salesforce.

398
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,900
We're running reports.

399
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:43,700
We're seeing all the opportunities in stage 3 looking at The notes within those opportunities and actually proactively suggesting case studies, and slides, that they should be leveraging those conversations.

400
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,300
So that's sort of something I hadn't had the time to do before that.

401
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,600
Something I want to focus on more now and moving forward.

402
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,500
And then again, yeah.

403
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,400
Figuring out, you know, how are these stories traveling?

404
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,900
Which stories are working?

405
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,700
Well, how do we produce more stories like that?

406
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,500
You know what, what are we missing as far as our inventory of stories?

407
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,600
I want to start diving more into those numbers.

408
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,900
You know I know Top my head, there's certain sub industries that we don't have as much representation as we should.

409
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,700
So that's something else.

410
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:20,200
I want to get my hands around as well as you know any stories were missing in terms of product so you know we just launched qualified meetings.

411
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:27,200
So that's something I want to be focused on is getting those stories of customers that are successfully using that piece of our product.

412
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,200
So good, thanks for sharing Bill's.

413
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,600
Got a question here.

414
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,300
Nick.

415
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,300
It sounds like you're generating a lot of content across.

416
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,900
A lot of channels though.

417
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,300
You did mention Focus right now, which is great?

418
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,100
What have you found?

419
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,200
Most effective?

420
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,400
What do you think will be effective even if it's not yet, driving metrics?

421
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,600
Yeah, I mean, for me, LinkedIn is my number one channel so, and I was able to fortunately build up a pretty decent sized audience there.

422
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:10,500
I have almost 42 thousand followers currently And, so I have been able to initially I Niche down really, really hard on field marketing at the start of the pandemic and it was I was the only one talking about it on all of LinkedIn.

423
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:19,400
Like how does it actually contribute to a revenue organization and so people were interested in that and then I branched out to ABM then I branched out to a lot of different topics.

424
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,400
And now more recently, I am talking about like, the customer marketing piece in its.

425
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,600
It's honestly, it's been really, really great.

426
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:37,100
And if you look at the content that I create, I actually Talk about Alice in 98% of that content and Leadership internally isn't happy about that, by the way.

427
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:52,000
But I think it's important because if I know that for 2022, I am going to drive about 15 to 20 million views on my content alone, organically on LinkedIn, think about how many people are clicking my profile.

428
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
So you know on LinkedIn where it says, every 90 days you can see how many people click your profile.

429
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,900
So I have about 15,000 people that view my profile.

430
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,800
Every 90 days on a rolling thing.

431
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,700
So the first thing that they do when they cook their profile, my profile is they see.

432
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:05,700
Oh cool.

433
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,600
He's at Alice.

434
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:07,700
Oh, what's a Liz?

435
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,700
Oh, they're gifting platform.

436
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,000
Oh, we use a competitor.

437
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,700
Oh, oh, we're thinking of budgeting for that, for 2023, they click it.

438
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:23,600
That's where the self-reported attribution standpoint comes in and all I am trying to do is share learnings of things that I am working on different types of projects like nothing is off limits for me.

439
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:29,100
And again, it's probably something that leadership isn't always happy about but I don't share anything that's negative.

440
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,300
You know numbers that I shouldn't be.

441
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:39,400
I just share projects that I am working on lessons, learn successes failures because people don't like to talk about failures because they feel judge.

442
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:45,500
I will talk about failures all day long because it's about the learnings that you do from those failures to move you forward.

443
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,700
And that's all I have really tried to do.

444
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:57,000
It's been in March of twenty 20, 30 be three years of me, creating content on LinkedIn, and so I have now doubled down on Tick, Tock and Instagram rails.

445
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And all I am doing is taking my written LinkedIn content and recording myself on video talking about what that text post was, and then Distributing it on, you know, YouTube shorts, rails, and Tick-Tock.

446
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,600
So it actually doesn't take me a ton of time to get this content out there.

447
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:19,200
It's more time, actually engaging in replying to every single person that comments on my stuff.

448
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,300
But that's how you build those real relationships.

449
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:31,600
That's how you get in those conversations when someone's thinking about your product, or service, or whatever it is, it's the relationships that you build in the Mint section that ultimately moved to DMS.

450
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,600
Ultimately move to inbound.

451
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:40,100
Requests ultimately remove the comes to like job offers down the road as well.

452
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:49,500
Like it can do a lot from you from a branding perspective in like building an audience, but you have to deliver value versus being that person that just is out there, pitching their company every day.

453
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,300
Such good, call-outs, tons of gems.

454
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:56,700
There.

455
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,200
I am curious are both of you?

456
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:08,400
So you mentioned, Nick, you're using Tick-Tock and these other social channels for customer marketing and other things.

457
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,500
Serena are you finding that successful as well wear for qualified?

458
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,800
Are you all exploring other social channels is linked in a good channel for qualified?

459
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,400
Yeah, so I would say LinkedIn is definitely our number one.

460
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:22,900
Channel.

461
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,800
And we're thinking about paid and organic.

462
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:48,700
And what we do is we will always promote our stories as well as our videos customer content on LinkedIn and will encourage our customers to do the same because, of course, we have got our audience, they have got theirs and so if we're able to package that up for them, they were able to share out on their channels and even you know within the folks then the story if they share out, you know, that's just amplifying the story.

463
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,200
So I would say that's definitely our number one channel.

464
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,300
That's great.

465
00:48:53,300 --> 00:49:01,300
So you all actually create the customer testimonial and then you quip your customer with that content with the asset so that they can amplify.

466
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,200
Exactly.

467
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,600
It's a great tactic.

468
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,500
Okay, awesome.

469
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:12,700
Well, I have got one other question here, and then we can start wrapping this up.

470
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:17,300
If anybody has any other questions, please drop them in the tab.

471
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:24,400
One question I have got is around just budget and headcount for customer marketing.

472
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,700
How do you justify the budget?

473
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:33,800
The head counts if you want to do a campaign or some sort of program that requires a budget.

474
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,400
How do you justify this?

475
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,400
Maybe this is tied to that attribution.

476
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,300
Note that we talked about earlier but just curious how it works for you all.

477
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:56,400
Yeah, I think the budget conversation aligns with the strategies, so it's kind of going into each quarter and understanding like what programs do we think need to be a priority this quarter?

478
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,100
What have we noticed?

479
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,100
That moves the needle from the previous quarter.

480
00:49:59,200 --> 00:49:59,700
What do we think?

481
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,600
We have done enough of that?

482
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:05,600
We can kind of put a pause on and then, of course, understanding all the numbers that align to them.

483
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:16,800
So for me, a big Focus for us this year was producing content, so we made the budget ask for Like building out our own Studio within our obvious.

484
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,900
So, we got a lot of photography equipment.

485
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,300
We got a lot of video equipment, but being able to set all of that up.

486
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:28,100
We have now hosted three photo shoots, and we have captured 50 plus customers.

487
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,100
So I think for us that's been a huge win.

488
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,900
A lot of people might be thinking, well, you know, she's mentioned photography a lot.

489
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,200
You know, why is that so important for us?

490
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,800
If you go on our website, you're not going to see stock photography.

491
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,900
You're going to see beautiful smiling.

492
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,500
Happy customers and those are real.

493
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:52,000
Real people, real stats, real quotes, real videos, and I think that's just so much more meaningful, it's so much more authentic.

494
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,200
And I think that's made a really, really big difference for us.

495
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,800
So, yeah, I think it's just really trying to get your hands around.

496
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,600
Like, what is going to be the priority figuring out what those numbers look like and then making the case for it.

497
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,200
So that's been my Approach.

498
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,100
Yeah, I love, I love that.

499
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:34,200
That idea, honestly, we don't have it on office unfortunately anymore, but like, I would absolutely like, if anyone that's listening, like, go steal that idea because like, I have also thought about that, and because we do use stock images on her website, but like it's such a brilliant idea and I love that and I will always remember that now.

500
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,000
But for me, like, I am a one-person team.

501
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,500
Like, again, we are like super like strap.

502
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:55,900
From a budget standpoint from a resource standpoint to like usually what I have to do is provide kind of like a business justification for what I am looking to do, and I am usually borrowing money honestly from our acquisition, acquisition side of the business.

503
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:04,700
So like maybe I am taking some from Paid search or yo are paid spend or maybe I am taking it from our event budget.

504
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,400
It's been up until I switched over to the customer marketing side.

505
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,800
We actually didn't have anyone in cusp of marketing.

506
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,500
Everyone was focused solely on acquisition up until like I would say like five or six months ago.

507
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:27,600
So it's also you know I think 2023 will change it will have its own budget line item and thing but for this year I have just been like stealing from people left and right when I need money.

508
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:44,300
Love about those notes and just the realistic also situation Nick that you're communicating because I think that's something you know it's like what can we do when you have a budget when you don't have budget, you got to get really creative right?

509
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,300
So I appreciate that a ton.

510
00:52:47,200 --> 00:53:03,300
All right, well we're going to be wrapping up here and I would love to end with just a note of any advice or encouragement that you have for all of Us as we're going into 2023, we're going to get into the holidays.

511
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,800
What's something that each of you would leave with us?

512
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:17,600
I would say double down on content creation, like with your customers with, with anyone.

513
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,800
Like I think that.

514
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,400
Yo and I qualified like does a fantastic job with this?

515
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:31,400
Because again, like I see them everywhere, I see the content that they create everywhere, I spoke at their event, you know, not too long ago, Aunt insulin on content.

516
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:31,800
Yeah.

517
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:47,700
So like I think, I think if anything like, you know, figure out how to create content, whether it's through customer stories, whether it's do organic, Nick paid whatever like utilize all these things and then double down on like the short form aspect of it and then like figure out how to distribute that at scale.

518
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,900
Yeah, that's really good.

519
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,400
I think something having done customer marketing for a while.

520
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:02,300
Now that I am constantly challenging myself to think about is, how do we do it different, you know, there's, we're so used to seeing case studies.

521
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:13,400
We're so used to videos, you know, and all those things sort of the standard pillars, which aren't bad, they're fantastic, but I want to spend more time next year, thinking about like, what is that?

522
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:18,100
Next big idea that we can offer our customers, that gets them really, really excited.

523
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,800
So, We have got some ideas, we have been throwing around internally, you know, customer appreciation day was one of them.

524
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:34,100
Revamping our customer page is going to be one of them, but, you know, now that we have got all this great content, you know, can we put it in the form of this incredible customer campaign that we do next year in?

525
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,700
Does that look like out-of-home?

526
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,100
Does that look like an event presence?

527
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:47,000
Does that look like a customer only event where, you know, to your point, Nick, your stories aren't talking about your product but it's, you know, could be just the customer sharing their stories.

528
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,800
So giving them the ability in the For me to do that.

529
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,300
I think would be really exciting.

530
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,100
So that will be a challenge I take on for next year.

531
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,200
So good.

532
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,700
Wow, thank you so much.

533
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,000

537
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,800
We have an interview tomorrow with Kevin Lee.

538
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:26,000
He is the SVP of marketing for oyster, and we're going to dive into another topic, that's very relevant.

539
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:40,100
In to 2023 the power synergies of brand building and actually team building, and they're oftentimes two sides of the same coin, and so he's going to dive into that.

542
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:50,300

543
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,000
It's me.

544
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,500
Don't show up.

545
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,500
Anything could stop me.

1
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,600
Did a full 180 crazy?

2
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,600
Don't come out.

3
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,900
Anything could stop me.

4
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,300
Hi everyone.

5
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,400
Happy Wednesday, it's great to be here.

6
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,700
It's great to see some of you trickling, in feel free to drop in what city you're tuning in from.

7
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:35,800
I am here in Ewa Beach, Hawaii, and this is about 30 minutes away from Honolulu in Oahu.

8
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,500
Can't complain about the weather right now.

9
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,300
It is, it is chillier.

10
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,200
But, you know, it's still probably around high 60s or so.

11
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,700
So, anyway, I am so excited today.

12
00:06:48,700 --> 00:07:01,900
We have got Alex Kelly director of digital marketing at serous joining us today, and we're going to be talking about attention-grabbing B2B Marketing in a very noisy Market.

13
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:13,600
There's a lot of efficiencies and different things that marketers are thinking about, as we're moving into 2023 and things, got to change the way that we Market.

14
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:21,600
The way that we work the way that we Singe and meet our buyers, across the buying Journey need to change.

15
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,900
And So within the constraints of 2023, it breeds creativity.

16
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:38,000
And I think this is the opportunity where we can hear from Alex on some of the Innovative approaches and ways in which he is able to Foster creativity and thinking with his team's.

17
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,200
So with that, I would love to invite Alex to the stage.

18
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,100
Please join me.

19
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,500
Hello, thank you.

20
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,500
Hello.

21
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,000
Thanks so much.

22
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,800
For having me.

23
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I am doing well.

24
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,500
It's been a pretty slow roll to the week, but excited to kick things up in the middle here.

25
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,900
Nice.

26
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,300
Nice.

27
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,500
Right.

28
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,200
Right before the holidays.

29
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,500
So, right, before everything just shuts down again.

30
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,100
Exactly.

31
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,600
Yeah.

32
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,200
Thanks for even just showing up really, really appreciate it.

33
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,900
And I am really excited about the conversation that we're going to dive into today.

34
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:31,400
But before we jump in, there's a few fun facts that I would love to jump right into And you know, all I will start with my fun fact, and then we will go into yours but I have got a different way of getting your fun facts notified.

35
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,900
So this is Allyson Felix and I basically played basketball with her.

36
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:50,400
We went to the same high school and it was funny because like, she literally could not make any basketball shot, like it would go straight off the backboard, but she was the fastest one down on each side.

37
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,300
I would have offense and defense to the end of the court.

38
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,300
So that's my fun fact for you.

39
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:04,100
Alex, we got some fun facts and you're a musician.

40
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:16,400
I am yes I study music in college and then I thought that's what I was going to do with my life and then you know, decided maybe I wasn't a hundred percent cut out for that life.

41
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:23,400
And when I moved back to New Jersey, I sort of fell into what I am doing now, which is very different but kind of similar in some ways.

42
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,300
Nice, nice.

43
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,800
And I know we were hoping to get a life singing session, but maybe another time.

44
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,200
Yeah, it wasn't quite feeling up to it after the last week and a half that I have had but I would have loved it all good.

45
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,900
All good.

46
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,300
Okay, so I have got another fun fact, sort of poll that we can do here.

47
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:51,400
It's called to it's will be three truths and One Lie and if we could pull that up on stage.

48
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,300
So there're these facts which some of these you just mentioned that are true about you?

49
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:07,000
But if you all want to vote, which one is not true about Alex, Go ahead and drop your votes.

50
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,700
Majored in music in college takes on graphic design.

51
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,100
Gig has twin boys, just got married.

52
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,400
So go ahead and drop in your votes.

53
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:26,200
This is where the Jeopardy music comes in doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

54
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,300
Okay.

55
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,300
All right, we got votes so just got married.

56
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,000
What's not true?

57
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,500
Alex.

58
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,300
I definitely do not take on graphic design gigs.

59
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,700
Nobody wants to pay me for that.

60
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,000
That would be, that would be an Abomination.

61
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,400
We're kind of playing.

62
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,700
We're splitting hairs here.

63
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:52,100
I got we had our wedding on Saturday, but it was after several covid.

64
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,500
Delays.

65
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,000
We were supposed to get married back in March of 2020, right?

66
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,200
When the world shut down, and we pushed it one year, which ended up not being nearly long enough.

67
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,800
So we ended up having to delay it.

68
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:10,000
It once again, and we decided to do it in December of this year.

69
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,400
So we legally got married in 2021 but it was very small thing and only our parents are there.

70
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:23,600
And so we finally had our wedding this Saturday, which is also why I am feeling not quite up to destroying my vocal cords.

71
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,200
Even more from all the singing and dancing we were doing.

72
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,200
Wow.

73
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,600
Congratulations.

74
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,200
Thank you.

75
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
What a big deal?

76
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,700
Yeah, and the we do have twin boys.

77
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:41,100
We have identical twins who are one-year olds, and they were able to come for a little bit.

78
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,500
So they we they got pushed down the aisle by our nephew which was definitely a highlight for both of us.

79
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,400
Well, I hope you get a ton of rest and recovery coming out of that.

80
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,400
Thank you.

81
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,500
Yeah.

82
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,600
So let us Jump Right In to know you even more.

83
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,500
I would love to dive into your story.

84
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Getting into B2B marketing.

85
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,400
And you know why, why beaten we have marketing wide Tech.

86
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,400
You probably could have gone to the b2c direction but walk us through your journey and how you got to serous.

87
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
Yeah, well everybody grows up.

88
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:27,700
Definitely wanted to be a B2B marketer when they're a child, they dream about it right now.

89
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,600
I studied music in college.

90
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:45,300
I thought that's the route that I wanted to go is The only thing I was really all that passionate about and spending a lot of my time, just performing and writing and doing all the things that I just found a lot of joy in and creatively and in school and all throughout college.

91
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,300
And when I graduated in started writing more and thought, that's what I wanted to go.

92
00:12:51,300 --> 00:13:05,200
I was still living down in Virginia and I kind of hit this point where I was either going to move to Nashville and really make that a concerted effort or I would already been From home in New Jersey for seven or so years.

93
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:13,700
A few years after college and I kind of wanted to go back for a bit and just see everybody that I had grown up with that, that was back in the area and my family was nearby.

94
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:26,000
And so when I, when I came back, I kind of fell into working with a really close friend of mine, doing some project management work at a mortgage company and it was a lot of requirements Gathering.

95
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,800
It was helping to organize their projects and keep them on task and just kind of help out wherever I could.

96
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,500
And some of the things that we ended up taking on.

97
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,700
We're very much in the digital marketing realm.

98
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,600
It was you know we were helping to build this new retail forward website.

99
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,800
They had Marketo install, but nobody really knew how to administrate it or use it.

100
00:13:48,800 --> 00:14:01,500
So I just kept raising my hand and saying, yeah, sure, I will try to teach myself how to do this, or we just got more involved in some of these kinds of projects because we were fairly fresh out of college and willing to take on some of these more.

101
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,200
Tech, heavy task and I really just enjoyed it.

102
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,700
I liked it, the things I was I was taking on I liked the challenge of it.

103
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:26,500
It was, it was also really fun to just try to learn as much as I could and teach myself what I needed to know, to do the job on the day, and it was a lot of, you know, reading Hub, spots blog and all that kind of stuff and just trying to learn as much as I because I never took any marketing courses and in college.

104
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:36,300
And, you know, after a few years there and you know, through that time I was given the opportunity to take on more direct ownership over these things.

105
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,800
I hired some folks and got to learn from a couple of others who are in the marketing realm.

106
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:50,000
And I really wanted to try to make that my core focus and moved over to working at an agency for a time.

107
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:01,500
It was a hotspot partner, inbound marketing agency and great way to learn a lot really fast working with a ton of different types of clients, but it was not exactly for me that kind of model.

108
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Where you're, you know, a team of one or two taking on eight or nine, clients in all these different Industries and doing everything for them, including all the account management and the strategy and the content creation, and the implementation and all that stuff.

109
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:22,200
So I after that, I was lucky enough to get connected with the team of data dog.

110
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:39,600
And, you know, I joined the demand generation team there which was just a really phenomenal sort of solidification of My understanding of B2B marketing and how a business like that can run and how a marketing team at a business like that can run.

111
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:48,600
And, you know, I worked with a team of really awesome marketers across all the different teams that we're supporting that business.

112
00:15:48,600 --> 00:16:03,700
And it was just a really, really awesome experience being there at the time that I was there and that was, you know, somewhere around the range of 250 to 600 plus employees and it Just under a year and a half that I was there.

113
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,800
So it was rapid growth.

114
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,300
There was a lot of success.

115
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,400
It was, it was just really fascinating to see how they ran.

116
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:29,100
And I kind of found myself missing a little bit of that chaos from the agency days when I was just getting my hands on everything and trying things out and seeing what worked, and I got introduced to the VP of marketing at serous through somebody that I had worked with and at data dog.

117
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:38,600
And, and just really liked what he had to say, and they were a smaller, team, smaller organization, really high appetite for experimentation.

118
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:47,300
And how the product is there were just over 100 maybe just a hair over 100 people, and they were not all in New York.

119
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,800
It was, you know, the entire product organization was remote.

120
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:56,100
There was a handful of people starting to start an in the UK and the rest of us were in New York City.

121
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:04,700
Office wasn't even nearly 100 people, so it felt a lot smaller and it felt Very contained in that way.

122
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,000
And I really liked that and then marketing team was pretty small.

123
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,500
We were with the VP maybe you know, five people or so.

124
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,200
And then we had an editorial team that was maybe three or four or think at the time.

125
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,099
And so there was just a lot of going on.

126
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:33,500
You're trying to figure a lot of things out and I like that energy about it and it was also just the last four and a half years that I have been here, just been a great learning experience and really great growing.

127
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,100
You know, experience to opportunity to grow and stretch myself and a bunch of different ways.

128
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:53,600
And, you know, now we're a little over 400 employees and, you know, a lot more people in the UK and now we're fully distributed and a global team which is just really, really interesting Evolutions over that time.

129
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:03,000
But yeah, not exactly what I thought it was going to do, but I have loved the, the Journey of it's been really, really fascinating plus I still The do creative things, but I love.

130
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,900
Hmm.

131
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,300
So tell us about what you do at serous.

132
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,500
Yeah.

133
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:21,100
So I head up the digital Bob bit of a misnomer, but I am the director of digital marketing, which started as purely taking ownership, over the digital team, which, you know, we had events and digital, which is kind of everything non-event.

134
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:37,800
And right now, I had up a team or help manage a team of around 10 marketers that is everything from digital, which is are always on digital programming or growth engine for inbounds coming in through the website.

135
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,000
It's email marketing and have an inbound SDR.

136
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:53,700
That's a part of that team, but we also that the team is also making up a demand generation more campaign, specific or account-based efforts to help support particular verticals.

137
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,900
I now lead our field marketing team, which is our event strategy across book, North America, and a Mia.

138
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,400
As well as customer marketing.

139
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:11,900
So all of our sort of enablement and dissemination of engaging content and materials for our existing customers as well.

140
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,000
So it's a bit broader than it started.

141
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:31,400
It's quite a bit broader than it started but it's, you know, it's kind of grown organically over that time, and we try to make it feel really cohesive as much as we can and really tie these different areas of the team together to make sure that we're all sort of capitalizing on what we're able to.

142
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:38,800
To do in tandem with each other not just individually as separate groups, how is your current marketing team structured?

143
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,300
So I helped oversee that, that part of the organization, which is those marketing functions.

144
00:19:45,300 --> 00:20:00,400
The more I would say campaign or Channel specific execution arms, digital demand generation field marketing and customer marketing as well as a web developer that helps oversee our various marketing web properties.

145
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,900
And then Of in parallel to us.

146
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:10,500
Next to us our VP of content oversees, all of the content and editorial social and design and creative resources.

147
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:22,500
So we partner really closely with that part of the team, and we are very dependent on them for a lot of the creative decisions and execution to help facilitate the programs that we're trying to run.

148
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:31,000
But I tend to focus mostly or at least I hope much heavier on the new business growth of the organization.

149
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,600
And a lot of the programs to help support that growth.

150
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,900
Wow, that's a lot of responsibility on your side.

151
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,200
It's been fun.

152
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:52,400
It's certainly been challenging especially over the last few years but the challenge has been you know really rewarding part A lot has changed over the last, you know, three or so.

153
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,500
Years going remote, you know, pretty much the entirety of the team.

154
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,300
One person on the team today on my side of the team today was here.

155
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,700
In the office with us everything.

156
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:10,200
Everyone else has been brought into the team since which is just sort of fascinating change to see.

157
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:16,500
But yeah, it's been, it's been a lot of stretching myself.

158
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:25,500
A lot of trying to learn and trying to learn as much as I can and take on some of these bigger challenges but that's what also keeps it really interesting.

159
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,600
That's awesome.

160
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:34,900
Well, jumping into the topic today, of attention-grabbing B2B marketing.

161
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,600
How are you thinking about this?

162
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,300
Especially going into 2023?

163
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,200
This is going to be more important than ever.

164
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,900
At the same time we don't want to just be noise, right?

165
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:57,800
As marketers, how can we create meaning and really that differentiated unique type of messaging, So what are your thoughts?

166
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
You know, in this topic going into 2023?

167
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Yeah, it's it is a challenge for everybody.

168
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,600
It's challenge for every Organization no matter what you're selling, what your who your customer is.

169
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:20,500
We as consumers are inundated with countless messages and marketing campaigns.

170
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,700
And, you know, just information overload across every channel.

171
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:25,900
Not even.

172
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,300
At, but our expectations have changed dramatically as consumers.

173
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,900
It's not even just the noise.

174
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:38,800
It's also, you know, we consume information and media so (differently) than we were even a handful of years ago in some of these cases.

175
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:55,900
But if you look at what Netflix and the streaming model is done for our consumption of media, if you look at how organizations are trying to adapt to that, you know, you can look at the changing landscape of how, you know, entertainment and movies are created and distributed it.

176
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:10,500
Its it is monumentally different from the experiences that we sought out as consumers, you know in the Years prior and our expectations of how we consume information and find information has changed.

177
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:17,300
Because of that we expect a very similar type of experience and delivery model from the businesses that were looking to consume from.

178
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:26,400
You know, as marketers, we create a lot of content, we are creating a lot of information, and we are looking to distribute that across all the Channels.

179
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,500
And we're always trying to find the ones that are connecting with our audience or where our audience is engaging.

180
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:54,600
But that landscape changes really rapidly and the I guess we look back you know, since the early 2000s that inbound marketing model of sort of owned media and these creating these platforms have content awareness and distribution where your you will create gated content offers.

181
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:03,000
And you will surround that with blog, Posts and you will rank for specific keywords and you will bring in this organic traffic and grow some more sustainably over time.

182
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:15,000
There's a lot of really good ideas in that are just a lot more challenging today because of the changing algorithms of what actually ranks and what Google is going to reward over other content.

183
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,500
It also is challenging because every organization is following the same Playbook.

184
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:29,500
We're all trying to do the same kinds of things, which means we're all creating the same articles for the same words in the same phrases, and We're always trying to outrank each other for that same traffic.

185
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,100
But Google is also sending less traffic back to your website.

186
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:42,100
Then they were in years prior because they want people to remain in their platform and every social media, platform acts, the same way, they're prioritizing the things that keep them there.

187
00:24:42,100 --> 00:25:00,600
Because that eyeball in, that platform, is more valuable to them than some of the ad dollars or whatever the case is that you're creating for your audience, they don't, they don't want to prioritize your value, they want to prioritize their own, so they will charge you for the same amount of awareness and an activity than they otherwise would have organically.

188
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:11,600
So all of these things are making it a lot harder to not just get the attention of your audience but to deliver information in a way that they actually care about and that they actually want to consume and interact with.

189
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:39,300
So what we have spent a lot of time, you know, doing and really it's very important parcel with what our platform kind of does, and we try to eat our own dog food as much as we can, which is We create content that we find incredibly interesting and, and more eye-catching and interactive, and then we find ways of refactoring that for whatever that Channel or the median is.

190
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,000
Because at the end of the day, your product message can be really compelling.

191
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,000
But if you don't have the eyeballs of that audience, they're never going to get there.

192
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,300
They're never going to find it.

193
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,900
So you need to get their attention first.

194
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,100
And then, you could start to translate that into ways of really understanding what your product, and what your ultimate.

195
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,500
You is to them as a consumer but it's really an attention economy at the moment.

196
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,100
And we're really just trying to figure out.

197
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:11,600
How do we, how do we combat the competition, which is not just the people that we compete with, on a product basis?

198
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:19,700
It is competition in the forms of people would rather spend their time scrolling through social media, then engaging with your business.

199
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,500
How do you play in that space?

200
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,000
They'd rather be looking at videos that are entertaining.

201
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,700
I am versus videos that might be relevant to what your product offers.

202
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:37,500
So how do you make your product messaging more entertaining and more like the things that they actually want to seek out all?

203
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:45,900
These things are sort of converging into this very difficult space of his digital competition.

204
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:56,400
So some of the things that we're trying to do our take our editorial Direction, and we have been doing this for quite some time, in the team is creating some really interesting.

205
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,800
Arresting interesting stuff, but our editorial direction is much broader.

206
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,000
It's not fully rooted in our buyer.

207
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,400
It's not fully rooted in our product.

208
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:13,200
It is just interesting stories told visually and through interactive lenses that is also sort of passive showcase for what our product can do.

209
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:34,500
So if they find that interest, and we're able to connect that interest it with the Right audience, then there're ways of us, re-engaging them with things that are more and more relevant to the business and the product further On the cycle, but we're always trying to lead with that eye-catching moment, that interactive element, that just gets them to lean in just a little bit.

210
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,000
Even though it's through a, through a screen in a digital channel, thank you.

211
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:50,300
I think you explained the landscape really well and the challenges of a very noisy attention-grabbing type of landscape that we have to deal with today.

212
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,200
What process are you working with your team to get to that?

213
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,600
Type of messaging that's differentiated and meaningful entertaining.

214
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:11,300
You know, I don't think the mechanisms there are two dissimilars What is ultimately necessary?

215
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:20,700
In all cases is to understand the customer and understand what they care about and what they're interested in, as it relates to their role.

216
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:27,300
But also expanding that lends to what they just find interest in and what they engage with in there, they're sort of day-to-day lives.

217
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:34,700
You know, the, the feedback loop sort of insight Gathering process is very much.

218
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,000
Still, a research based effort, it's having conversations with people.

219
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,800
Trying to observe them in their natural habitat, it's just taking conversations in a more natural Direction versus it being purely.

220
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,300
Well, how would you solve this problem and what do you feel when you experience that problem?

221
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,200
And it's not 100% around?

222
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
What is your product?

223
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,300
How to understand?

224
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,800
How your product can solve for a problem?

225
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,000
It's also just, you know, what are you interested in?

226
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,100
What are you seeing today?

227
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,100
That is really catching your eye.

228
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,700
What do you where do you go for information?

229
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,000
Where do you turn to that?

230
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:16,300
You trust who Are the people that you really perk up when they're speaking about a topic that's related to the things that you care about.

231
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:24,600
And if you can kind of converge, those topics of Interest with the people of influence and the channels of connectivity.

232
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,700
That's really where the magic happens but you really can't get there.

233
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:43,200
Unless you're either having direct conversations or trying to, you know, find that research out and more mass-market ways of either existing research or conducting your own Roan on a more broad basis but it's got to come from your audience.

234
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:55,700
Otherwise, you're going to be led astray by the time, the tactics and strategies that got us to where we are today which is not going to get us through the next, you know, three five ten years as the landscape continues to evolve and change.

235
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:03,900
So we were to get a little more tactical on how you go about to gather the research and the insights.

236
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:12,500
Are you regularly doing customer interviews, or what are ways in which you are able to get those insights?

237
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:22,000
Yeah, couple of ways either direct conversations were its it is sort of structured more than a fact-finding mission.

238
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,700
We are, we want to speak with, you just about your behaviors, and we want to understand what makes you tick.

239
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:45,500
We want to understand, you know what you do in your day-to-day, both inside work and out and how we can use that to start a triangulate as we interview more, more people, you can also create content anchors that help to capture those insights on a more ongoing basis.

240
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,400
You know, we're doing it right now, you're having a conversation with me.

241
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,800
I am a director of marketing or digital marketer at an organization of a particular size and profile.

242
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
I am talking about the things.

243
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:03,900
I am doing and what I find interesting and what got me to where I am, these are all things that we can you could feed back into your overall strategy of.

244
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,300
Okay.

245
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Well how do I use that to change?

246
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,200
How I distribute a message to somebody like Alex in his role at as organization?

247
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:25,000
And so when these mechanisms exist and you're constantly speaking with and recording and Gathering insights from people that you ultimately are looking to engage with all of that.

248
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,700
Is it accessible.

249
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,500
Information.

250
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:33,300
All of that becomes fodder for each change in the strategy or change in the message or a change in the tactic.

251
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:55,200
Also, going directly to the sales organization listening to a ton of gone calls and you know, hot trying to look for certain keywords or phrases or things that topic areas that are of interest and to see what kinds of organizations are speaking about things or, you know, not trying to gain Insight through a game of telephone but going right to the source.

252
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,700
What are they?

253
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:05,800
On these calls that you could use in your own messaging more, you're using their words the, you know, the better off things are going to be as long as you're able to figure out how to package those things up.

254
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:12,200
So, you know, there's I would say, existing mechanisms in kind of all businesses to gain those insights.

255
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:22,100
Somebody in the company is having regular conversations with your audience and it's really figuring out how to tap into that or as a marketing organization, create platforms.

256
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:35,300
Like this, that allow you to speak with people that are, you know, Know your target audience or subject matter experts in your area that you can, then start to sort of feed those insights back into the broader team in a way that is more accessible or more.

257
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,100
Distributable.

258
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,700
So okay, II.

259
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,500
Love this.

260
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,400
And thank you for validating that.

261
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,200
Even this opportunity right now is sort of fact-finding.

262
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,900
B2B marketers is one of our targets, right?

263
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:55,700
So just to ask you a question, what type of messages resonate with you?

264
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:02,700
What type of going into 2023, again, you're probably getting hit up, DMS and Linkedin.

265
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,100
Emails are inundated.

266
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,500
I mean, that's the world of what a lot of Experience of beauty marketing.

267
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,500
But what's going to touch you differently?

268
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
What's going to grab your attention?

269
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,800
Alex, it is so difficult.

270
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,300
It's so hard.

271
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:59,200
And I know, I know full, well, I my attention to my inbox or, you know, the amount of phone calls that I get in a day, my attention can't always turn to those things and, and full transparency, I think a lot of folks, you know, A lot of folks know inherently know this and feel it in their personal lives and just generally we know this, and we also know that the tactics work but I have a hard time getting connected to a message in those mediums where it's somebody picking up the phone and calling me directly where it.

272
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:06,200
There's no sort of Preamble or there's no pre-existing awareness of what it is.

273
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:18,000
We're actually trying to The phone down to talk about or same thing in my inbox, my I think like most people, my email is a disaster site and it is so hard to find the things that are irrelevant.

274
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,500
Let alone, the things that are not what works for me personally.

275
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,199
And I can't say that's the same for anybody else is things like this.

276
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:56,000
When there is a platform of information that is Really high quality that I am able to go out and seek information from rather than it being pushed in front of me when I connect with a source more than I connect with a single episode or a single topic and I come back time and time again, more often than not, I am going to go to them.

277
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,100
I am going to, I am going to reach out when I have a need or a challenge or something.

278
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:13,200
That I think they can help me with because they have already proven that they can help me with it because Hi, I have listened to or watched or engaged with things over the course of several months.

279
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,700
It could be several years.

280
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:27,300
We think brought on drifts for first ballot early on, in my time at saris and I had been listening to their, their, their stuff and an engaging with their content for years prior to that.

281
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:35,300
And I just really had a sort of I wanted to be able to check it out in a way that was more advantageous to them.

282
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,800
But I was never to Into until I was.

283
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:44,900
And then when I was, I went directly to them, it wasn't a sales call, and there's, there're countless examples of that.

284
00:35:45,200 --> 00:36:14,700
We're usually when I get to the point of making a decision of being able to solve a problem, there's already a short list in my mind and that short list is probably pretty short because there're names that I recognize there's people that I feel like I can trust even if I have never spoken to them because I have spent the time and I put in the time to engage and consumed as much as I can, which is ultimately how I got to where I am I learned from others, I didn't, I didn't know any of this before I started, it's here.

285
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,700
It's all in service of engaging with others.

286
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:29,600
So, the more I am able to do that or sort of put out a bat signal in a community of people that I feel like I can trust, their opinions, it starts to narrow down the list.

287
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,000
So the message is really difficult.

288
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,700
The more that it's led by sort of entertainment and education and a Spurt.

289
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,300
He's the better off.

290
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:50,600
It, it lands with me but it takes a lot of time, and we don't always have time as marketers or especially not of the sales professionals which makes it all the harder.

291
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:58,200
So the more you can invest early on the better off you're going to be you know a year or two years from now but it's that's really the challenge that everybody is up against.

292
00:36:59,300 --> 00:36:59,900
It's good.

293
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:07,000
All right, so if anyone's got questions for Alex, feel free to drop them in QA looks like a has one question.

294
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:15,700
What are some tactics you have used to build brand awareness, especially at a time when budgets are getting tighter, yeah.

295
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:26,500
Our CEO has said this a couple of times in different contexts and there's this mentality of, you know, champagne results for beer money.

296
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:36,600
We're just because budgets tighten, doesn't necessarily mean that the, the execution of something needs to suffer, right?

297
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,700
On.

298
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:47,300
In most cases, when constraints are added into a process, it actually breathes a higher level of creativity because you have to be really creative.

299
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:47,700
Native.

300
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,800
And in some cases Scrappy to solve a problem.

301
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,100
And that's where a lot of the really robust and sort of meaningful ideas can come out of.

302
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:14,100
So the tactics might be the same in essence, but the way in which you execute, those things might just have an added layer of creativity added into that and I guess some examples of that.

303
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:42,300
We had a We had thrown a an event a few years ago for a product launch and you know, we weren't trying to do something so astronomically expensive, but we were trying to do something really meaningful, and we were trying to do something that really helps to play into the message of the day and the message of the day was all about creating experiences and that experience ultimately is what matters, right?

304
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:54,800
It's the things that we experience are what make them real the experiences that we seek out in The world are meaningful, the difference between a good experience in a bad experience, is so Monumental.

305
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:03,000
But both of those things stick out in our mind for different reasons, and the team spent a countless amount of time and putting their heads together, really?

306
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,900
Trying to figure out how to nail this thing?

307
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,000
And some of it was, was not thrown together.

308
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:19,400
It was, it was just done in such a way that Illustrated that concept, it was, you know, a bad experience entering into this venue versus A sort of red carpet experience.

309
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:26,600
The bad experience was just Solo cups and, you know, Gruff looking people and a dingy coat rack and a bat back kitchen.

310
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:32,300
But that helped illustrate exactly what we were trying to go for without having to spend even more money to help.

311
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,900
Really, you know, gussied up that part of the experience.

312
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:47,300
We also had thrown together a stand-in for a DMV to help illustrate the sort of antiquated ways that people create content.

313
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:56,700
And it's just like, brought this space to light, but it was all, you know, is, you know, rope and pipes and stuff that would kind of pull together in a really crafty way.

314
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,400
And we threw up a web page for that.

315
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,900
Using Sarah's in like an hour.

316
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,500
The designer did an awesome job, making it look purposefully bad.

317
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,700
But we just had a really fun afternoon trying to do that as quickly as we could.

318
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,800
Because they realize, hey we put a URL in the back.

319
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,200
Is this thing that were printing out?

320
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,100
Can you throw something up on the website?

321
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,300
Yeah, we could do that.

322
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:54,400
So, I mean it's finding ways of just having fun with it and creative executions on tight, constraints, actually make things feel like they're more meaningful as much as they as much as these flashy things people kind of they can see through the, the shine in a lot of cases and it just doesn't feel quite as real, you know, I think other ways to build awareness are just your content doesn't have to look and feel premium for it to be really meaningful and to be really authentic, and Be really entertaining.

323
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,400
I mean, look at any book.

324
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:06,200
It's just words on a page, but the feelings that generates are so varied that it's, it's insane.

325
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,300
I have a stack of books on my desk right behind my monitor.

326
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:16,600
That would be really, really sad to show people, but it's just, that is a mechanism.

327
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:22,600
That is very Lo-Fi in a lot of cases, but it's such a, it's still building a meaningful connection.

328
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,600
So, you know, there're ways of doing events, there're ways of doing virtual events in a really cost effective way.

329
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:39,100
And just having conversations with people, one-on-one to breed really creative ideas is a good place to start and say That's great.

330
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,900
Thank you for that.

331
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,200
I, you know, I wanted to dive a little bit into.

332
00:41:46,400 --> 00:42:06,900
I remember you talking about your collaboration with design and how you can work with different parts of the marketing org, that maybe you wouldn't normally do like a strategy brainstorm with or something like that, but you were talking about how its arrows, you all have done that and have had great outcomes results come out of it.

333
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:14,500
So could you describe your creative process to get to some of the ideas that you were even sharing?

334
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,400
Yeah.

335
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:49,100
It's fun because it's always evolving but it's, you know, I think it's marketing organizations for marketers and marketing teams we can think about things in a really linear fashion where we might have a sort of primary message that we're going for we create this long document of narrative, or We create this, Google doc with all of our messaging and maybe it's a blog post, maybe it's something longer, and we send that over to a designer when it's all said and done, we have created the strategy.

336
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:56,100
We have created the we know who the audience is, we have done all the research, we have created all the copy, and we send it over to somebody to essentially produce off of that.

337
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,700
Where it's just taking, you take this thing that I have already decided I am doing.

338
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,800
And can you make it look better?

339
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:11,100
It's and presentable, and we have found Time and time again, that the earlier in the process is that we Engage The Design Team.

340
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:29,300
The, the more involved, they are in the actual strategy development in the, the investigation of ideas the better off the end result is, you know, its it just opens up the conversation and ways that we might not have expected.

341
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,700
They will ask questions that we didn't think about.

342
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:38,400
They will ask us why a lot, and we More you ask the world.

343
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:38,800
Why?

344
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,500
And really dig into that.

345
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,700
Sometimes you don't always have an answer and maybe that's telling, right?

346
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,000
And then we need to kind of go back to the drawing board and figure some stuff out.

347
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,800
But having them involved.

348
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:57,900
From day one before it's, you know, really a solidified idea before it's something that is more concrete.

349
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,600
It is just a problem to solve designers and visual thinkers.

350
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,200
They think about solving problems in a very different way.

351
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:15,700
So instead of it being a very linear production, Yes, we try to make it more cyclical, we try to make it more collaborative from the beginning where that brief is put together.

352
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:28,200
There's a lot of iteration on just even the sort of underlying needs and you know feelings that we're trying to evoke or audiences that we're looking to go after what do we know about them?

353
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:37,200
How do we put all of that into this, this sort of shared understanding and this brief and from there, you know, the copy and the wireframe?

354
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:42,700
The design all feed off of each other and there's a lot of going back and refactoring things that aren't working.

355
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:53,800
There's a lot of sparking new ideas throughout the process, and then we ultimately end up in a place that's just more fun and more interesting and that shines through to the audience more.

356
00:44:53,800 --> 00:45:05,400
(So) than even the team that's creating it, you know, an example of that is, we recently were trying to create essentially, create more use case content.

357
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:39,600
We were trying to Showcase more or of how, you know, content created in Sarah's helps to solve for very particular pain points in the in these certain kinds of Industries, and we have examples from clients, we have a lot of examples of things that were created, and we just wanted to find a different way of presenting it, so we, it was pitched to us, as this idea, to essentially create a fake business, a fake brand with fake brand guidelines, with a very outlandish product, and they had the very same challenges that a lot of (Is) have and here's exactly how they did it.

358
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:51,200
And what that piece of content looks like and what their messaging looks like in context and it allowed us to create this really fun story and really Branch off of that in very different ways but the end result is the same.

359
00:45:51,200 --> 00:46:04,000
We connect it to a pain point, that a very real business will have and it's very much also shows what exactly they can do to solve for this problem and ultimately connect that back to a product value.

360
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:09,300
This product is called the, the ripe So detector, so that you always get to that.

361
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:17,200
Exact ripe avocado before it goes, starts to go bad in your drawer and I think people just had fun with it.

362
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:25,100
We had fun creating it and the team just had a lot of fun ideas to bacon at this, and we would never have come up with that on our own.

363
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,500
We just wouldn't have we would have gone a little bit more traditional, which ultimately wouldn't have really felt like saris.

364
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:36,600
And we're thankful to have partners that really push us to think outside of the box on that.

365
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,700
So good.

366
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:47,900
All right, we have a couple of more questions that have come through saline is asking, what is top of mind for you go into 2023?

367
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,000
What are some things you will be doubling down on ya.

368
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:59,000
We have spent a lot of time over the last few months thinking about our event strategy.

369
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,900
And you know what has been working for us?

370
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,200
What hasn't necessarily been working quite as well?

371
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,200
So we are spending a lot of time.

372
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,700
Time thinking through.

373
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:20,000
How do we take that same ethos of creating really interesting digital experiences and make those come to life in a physical space as well?

374
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,000
Or at least make sure that the same things are true.

375
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:29,500
That the same constraints are there that the same, the same sort of guiding principles are there?

376
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:40,700
And, you know, as we have been sort of rebuilding and building out our field marketing team and thinking through our representation and Different markets and sort of building the plan for next year.

377
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:48,700
I find there's just so much opportunity for us to think about the in-person representation of the brand.

378
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,200
And how does that lead to the conversations that we want to have?

379
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,400
Yes, the operational sort of underpinnings to that is something.

380
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:02,500
I have spent personally a lot of time on to make sure that we're buttoning, things up in the right ways and that the strategy is more sound.

381
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:09,400
But you know, the creative execution of that is so important to it is the first People see when they're walking by, they see your booth.

382
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:17,400
They see the representation of the product they see touch screens or you know, just visual cues makes them want to come and speak with you.

383
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,800
And that is really important in an in-person event.

384
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,800
So it's a strategy that's worked really well for us.

385
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:29,000
And we're trying to find ways of making it work, exponentially better in the years to come.

386
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:42,700
And then I think what's really top of mind for me is just how do I ensure as the team is executing and really focused on The objectives and the goals that we are tying all these things together as best we possibly can.

387
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,600
How is the digital engine, helping to support the demand generation campaigns, that are very specific to an audience?

388
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,800
How does that tie into the content strategy and our editorial planning?

389
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:04,600
What are some of these really interesting out their stories that are still really hyper relevant to the audience's that we care about on the downstream effect and in our sales and marketing Pipeline?

390
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:24,400
And how do we make sure that it's just, we're, we're amplifying, the things that we can amplify, and we're making sure that the all of these components are working together to build this much bigger representation of what we want to be seen as a known for and it all helps to showcase the power of the platform in different ways.

391
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:33,100
So that's really top of mind for me, as we enter into next year because it will last couple of years have really been, how do we just navigate, what's in front of us?

392
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:40,800
And it's just, we're sort of, you know, riding the waves to some And that's not going to change, but there's a lot that we can do in that.

393
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:52,600
I can focus on to help ensure that at the very least, the team has solid foundation and structure as possible to just collaborate as best we can, that's huge.

394
00:49:52,600 --> 00:50:03,100
I think that alignment and collaboration and the currency of the trust and structure that you're providing is going to be really critical going into 2023 as far as events.

395
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,900
So that's interesting that you all are looking at in-person events in particular.

396
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,400
What conferences Summits in person events?

397
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,600
Are you all looking at for next year?

398
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:18,900
Yeah, there's a number we have had a lot of success at, you know, going back to HubSpot.

399
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:26,400
We have had a lot of successes in bounds and it's, it's a, so I was there in September in person.

400
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:37,100
And first time, I would been since 2019, I think it's the first time we as an organization have been and it was just the, I think it was also unique to that.

401
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:37,800
Here.

402
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:45,800
Everyone was so happy to be there and the energy level of people being in person and talking to their co-workers.

403
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:55,800
And the people that are in a very shared similar space was pretty electric and people were really interested in.

404
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:12,900
And what you know, the organization's had to say the sessions were really compelling and I also think they just did a really incredible job of to refactoring the layout of the space to account for just the reality of what today actually needs versus, you know, a few years ago.

405
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,600
But you know that's a pretty big one for us.

406
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:29,800
We're looking at the Adobe, you know, Summit and Adobe Max to connect with, you know, the marketing and design audiences in different ways where there's a number of other events that have started to come onto the scene for us more.

407
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:36,500
So in the last couple of years obviously is everything is shifted virtually or did shift virtually entirely for a couple of years.

408
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:48,800
There's a number of vendors that do really high quality meeting setting, like one-to-one conversations that are happening both in person and virtually that had just been incredible pipeline builders for us and any organization.

409
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:56,900
And we're going to make sure to continue to do those as we get back to some of these bigger conferences, just to be able to show off the brand more.

410
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:04,300
Those are really about just in connecting the product story, as deeply as we can to people that have a very particular need and challenge.

411
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,100
So we're trying to find the right mix.

412
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,700
That's great.

413
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:08,600
All right.

414
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,800
Spencer has a question here.

415
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,400
This will probably be our last question.

416
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,700
That will take you mentioned.

417
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:20,200
That one of the most effective ways of marketing to you is to be a respected resource.

418
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,400
How would you justify and monitor an approach like this?

419
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,500
That would likely take a while to see results from?

420
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:27,500
Yeah.

421
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,300
It's especially if you're a small team, it's a hard thing.

422
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,500
It's because there's such immediate needs to help bolster the business.

423
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:41,200
Des and it does, it takes a lot of time, you know, I think like anything.

424
00:52:41,200 --> 00:53:00,100
There's there needs to be pretty clear expectations set up front around what you believe it is ultimately going to take and that's going to take time, it's going to take resources is going to take a little bit of patience, may be a lot of patients in some cases but just because it is going to take a lot of time.

425
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:06,600
Doesn't mean that it's not going to show some promise earlier on and that promise might be not might not be in.

426
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,700
The form of pipeline that might not be in the form of closed, one business.

427
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:18,600
It might not even be in the form of, you know, people coming to you and saying explicitly, they want to use your solution, or they're interested in learning more about your product.

428
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:40,500
But if you are getting the right, personas the right organizations, the right kinds of individuals, engaging with that, Clark property or that content or that, you know that particular you know, series whatever that format is and you're getting some qualitative feedback that's really helping to bolster the effectiveness of it.

429
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:47,500
That can be enough to go on in the early days it can be enough to show that you were saying the right kinds of things.

430
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:53,100
The right kinds of individuals are finding it and now it is about how do you iterate on that strategy?

431
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,200
How do you build more Foundation underneath it to hell?

432
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:12,000
A pre engage and bring them back to learn more about the product because one effort and one tactics, not going to do it all, it's not going to help solve this Big Brand Story and help build a point of view and also showcase the product in a really compelling way.

433
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,200
It's really hard to do that.

434
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,100
All on through one, through one mouthpiece, or one lens.

435
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:26,200
So the expectations and the, the ways that you measure that need to be different and it's likely going to be pretty qualitative.

436
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:38,400
Especially in the early days but you know if you have the right, you know, the right c-level executive of the right company saying like well that was really interesting there and all they're doing is leaving a comment on a social post that might be enough.

437
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,100
It might be enough to show, you know, show your boss to say people are engaging in the right people are engaging.

438
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:59,400
We need to figure out a way to make this more sustainable or maybe a little bit more efficient or, you know, pump a little bit more into this to figure out how we you know, broaden that mouthpiece to really capitalize on what's working, but it is.

439
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,700
It's a journey and it can be a really difficult one.

440
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:05,300
When the pressure is on for that in quarter, pipe line objective.

441
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:09,300
That is also staring you down, so it's not easy.

442
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,500
But that's what I would look.

443
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,800
For is whatever early signals.

444
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:19,600
You can possibly find that show that you're moving in the right general direction, because you're never going to get it right the first time.

445
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,800
That's good.

446
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,600
That's good.

447
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:32,600
So for the teams we need to determine those early signals and you said it could be as simple as like a third-party solicited message.

448
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,600
You know, from our targeted buyer or something like that.

449
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:43,500
That's not necessarily an mql conversion but you know an early detector like you said.

450
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,600
So that's good to know.

451
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,300
Awesome.

452
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,700
All right, Alex.

453
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,500
Well thank you so much.

454
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:56,200
For taking the time with us today to just drop your wisdom and knowledge for us.

455
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:04,600
Could you leave us with one word of encouragement or advice for the B2B marketing community?

456
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,200
Yeah.

457
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:19,400
As you join any organization, it can be very overwhelming to learn the business and the buyer and the things that are working or not working.

458
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,900
And all of the things that you, you just need to absorb as somebody in an organization.

459
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:50,800
But I think anywhere you go, it's important not to lose you and your individuality, and the things that make you unique because they hired you, they hired you for a reason, the way that you present yourself the way that you see the world, the way that you know, just the way that you approach the work, whatever, whatever the case might be, there're things that make us who we are, that, that are valuable to any organization.

460
00:56:50,800 --> 00:57:01,300
And when you can figure out a way to make your individuality mesh with the company objectives and those big picture goals, that's really where the magic happens.

461
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:09,600
You know, I am I fancy myself a musician, I have not spent nearly enough time investing in that over the last few years.

462
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:18,800
Especially with twins but the things that I find Value in our those creative Pursuits.

463
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:33,500
And even though I am a much more Revenue focused Market or today, I still make sure that I am engaging in Creative Pursuits, either in the office or outside of, or having these conversations that feel fulfilling in that vein because it's important to me.

464
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:51,500
And when it's important to me and I feel more fulfilled by that, then I give more to the organization that I am a part of, so I think that's just so important just, you know, not to Lose Yourself to the big, the big machine around us, and they will be better off for it when they're able to find ways of enabling that as well.

465
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,200
Wow, such a powerful Point.

466
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,200
Thank you so much.

467
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:02,700
I mean, I think that is right on about not losing yourself because it's you can get overwhelmed.

468
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,400
Not just even with the business needs.

469
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:14,600
But you go on LinkedIn and it's like Doom, scroll with how many layoffs taking but like all these different Marketplace factors and the economy and all these things.

470
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:22,500
But at the end of the day, there is a special magic that each person brings to an organization.

471
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:27,900
And we need to hold onto that if anything double down on that, going into 2023.

472
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,600
Exactly amazing.

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,300
He is The SVP of marketing with oyster and boy.

26
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:22,500
He's got a lot of deep knowledge and experience in B2B marketing and leading remote teams.

27
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,900
And today we're going to dive into a very great tap topic as it relates to going into 2023.

28
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:41,600
A lot of teams need to be thinking about their brand and on the flip side of that building healthy phenomenal, remote team culture, they go hand-in-hand, is brand ties to your values, your vision.

29
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,200
Your mission and how that gets communicated externally and internally.

30
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,200
So, with that, I would love to invite Kevin to the stage.

31
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Hello.

32
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,000

00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,100
It's a pleasure to have you here.

37
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,700
Kevin.

38
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,900
I am such a big fan of you, and just everything that you have invested into the B2B marketing Community.

39
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,600
You have got a quite, you got quite a following, and you have your own news.

40
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,500
Newsletter.

41
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,900
How long have you been maintaining your own database of marketers?

42
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,500
Yeah, it's interesting.

43
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:32,000
So I number all my newsletters, I think this week's, I said, when every week this week's is 350 or something, which is not to say I have sent 350 of them, but I put the year number at the start and then number each week.

44
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,500
And so this is my third year, on some stuck, the 50th week of the year.

45
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,900
So three or sometimes doctor I have been doing it a bit before then too.

46
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,500
Wow, God Gotcha and there's such Rich information in there.

47
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,600
If people wanted to check it out.

48
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,300
What's the website link again?

49
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:57,100
Yes, he can get there through my personal website, which is Kevin Lee.com and then the direct subject link is Kevin Lee dotsub stack.

50
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,600
That qasim okay?

51
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,900
Yeah, definitely check it out, if you're interested.

52
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,200
So you're tuning in from Boise Idaho.

53
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,800
I know there's some fun facts that we want to learn to get to know you a little bit more.

54
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,700
So I put together this little pole and basically it's three truths and One Lie.

55
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,900
So if we could Pull that pull up on stage here.

56
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:34,200
Okay, so we have got these four different answers which of these is not true about Kevin one teaches marketing at a college to be a newspaper.

57
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,600
Reporter reads three reads 50 to 100 books each year or for has an MBA.

58
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,900
So go ahead and drop your votes.

59
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,100
And then we will see which one is not true.

60
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,800
Okay, I tried to vote myself.

61
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,300
This is, these are good.

62
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,800
I don't think people believe that you actually could potentially Read 50 to 100 books each year.

63
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,700
That's a lot.

64
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,600
That is a lot.

65
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,400
It's a lot bigger.

66
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,100
Alright though.

67
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,900
So yeah.

68
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,400
Okay.

69
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:18,400
So let us reveal the answer drumroll and the answer Kevin which one of these is not true.

70
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,900
I do not have an MBA, okay.

71
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,100
So you actually read 50 to 100 books.

72
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,000
Each year I do.

73
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,900
Yeah, I was lucky when I worked at buffer which is a B2B SAS social media company.

74
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:44,000
One of our perks was a free Kindle and as many Kindle books as you wanted and so that got me hooked into reading and I have carried that habit with me ever since.

75
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,900
So yeah, I read a mix.

76
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:53,500
I try to read short one so that I can get the number up and feel good about like hitting a milestone, but that is the range I try for each year.

77
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
That's awesome.

78
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:03,200
So what are some of your more recent books that you are reading and that you would recommend?

79
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,500
Yeah.

80
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,400
So I just published my best of books to my newsletter list for like the full.

81
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:16,400
I think it was 50 or 60 this year that I read and I didn't read by many marketing books this year which I don't know if that's like what that means.

82
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,600
Maybe I am burnt out on marketing books or something like that.

83
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,800
But the one that I love this year that was somewhat marketing related was called the sea.

84
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,700
We In.

85
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:34,000
It was all about storytelling and the importance of Storytelling for Branding, for marketing, for politics, for culture, like for so many different reasons.

86
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,900
And so you probably wouldn't find it in the business section of a Barnes Noble or library.

87
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,800
But for me, it had a lot of interesting takeaways from marketing.

88
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,400
And then one of my favorite marketing books of all time is a book called Alchemy.

89
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,900
It's written by one of the executives at the Ogilvy advertising agency.

90
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:02,900
It is just such a mind-blowing blend of science and art within marketing which I believe there is both a lot of science.

91
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,400
But also a lot of art that you can't really explain with what we do on marketing side.

92
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,900
And so that's been a really influential book for me, and put words to a lot of the feelings that I had with how I go about marketing.

93
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,700
Love that.

94
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,900
That's a classic right there, agreed.

95
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,400
Yes.

96
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,800
Wow.

97
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,500
Okay.

98
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:31,900
Well, thank you for sharing that and you know, I wanted to dive a little bit more into, just your story getting into B2B marketing.

99
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,400
And why, how did you get into it?

100
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,900
And why did you choose B to B?

101
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,200
Because you probably could go beat his see, as well, you know?

102
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,900
So why B to B Tech totally?

103
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,100
Well, I kind of stumbled into it.

104
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:48,900
I don't even know if I consciously like knew what B2B stood for when I started like down this.

105
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,400
And so, for me, it was wanting to join, wanted to join.

106
00:13:53,400 --> 00:14:06,800
A start-up, was one of my primary motivations and even the reason for joining a start-up was because I had a really high belief in remote work and the ability to like, do work that you're passionate about and like results-based.

107
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:18,500
Work environments, I came from a very traditional marketing background with, you know, office and suit and tie and show up to work every day and sit in meetings, and it was just like a very stereotypical experience.

108
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,100
I thought But I want something different.

109
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,500
So that led me toward toy startups.

110
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
I love the optimism of startups.

111
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:35,400
I love the scale of startups but I had no concept of what the difference between B2B and b2c was, which is maybe can partially explain how I do marketing today in some ways?

112
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:50,500
So the company that really caught my eye was buffer, which was a company that was mission first, really cared about culture and values and that was all I needed to hear like they had a An opening for writer.

113
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:58,300
And I was brought up into in newspaper, reporting and journalism and all these different written communication fields.

114
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:05,200
And so, I was like, I would love to write for a full-time job, and I want to do it at a place that cares, as much as I do about culture and values.

115
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,400
That was my start buffer happened to be a B2B company.

116
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,500
And so gained a lot of experience there.

117
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,400
And I haven't looked back since Wow, that's awesome.

118
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,300
How many years ago was that?

119
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,100
That was about ten years ago.

120
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:30,300
Guy trans I had some exposure into like New Media and startups before that through my time at vaux and that was eye-opening as well.

121
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,700
Now that was I was there for five years of as well.

122
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,100
So like 15 years total in Canada, startup and texting.

123
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,600
Wow.

124
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:56,100
Okay so tell us a little bit about like what were some of the most challenging the moments that you experienced in your startup, especially the early stages of just, like, learning about what is B2B and you know, what were some of those challenges Yeah.

125
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:06,100
Yeah, it was interesting because I think I because I don't have an MBA as we learned in the poll earlier, and I am not formally trained and educated in marketing.

126
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:15,800
So much of the marketing that I knew was either from my core discipline of content or was from the marketing that I experienced when Brands and products are being marketed to me.

127
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:27,100
And so, I think I have always had some of that like user first DNA, into my B2B marketing plans like b2c DNA Within The world that B2B marketing.

128
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,900
It's that was really helpful.

129
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:44,700
I think as a starting foundations like how would I like to be marketed to let me make sure that is true of the marketing that I do and then my team is doing so that was I think a useful Foundation to start from, but then like my education and to B2B marketing was it was like super steep.

130
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,200
Like I woke up every day at work thinking, today was going to be the work that I did.

131
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,100
Today would be the day.

132
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,100
I get found out is an impostor and I don't know anything about what I am doing, and I am sent packing.

133
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:01,100
You're thinking, so there was always that like, underlying fear of, I am not qualified or not cut out for this.

134
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:07,599
And so that motivated me to stay curious to learn as fast as I could.

135
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:20,000
The, the things that I had gaps in and to be very self-aware of where I knew, I didn't like understand the certain acronym in a meeting or understand certain phrase like rather than try to avoid like ever being close to that phrase again.

136
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,500
Like I would go out and research it understands what am I missing here was the context?

137
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,099
And so I think that Like early days.

138
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,100
I know my curiosity and my drive to succeed.

139
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,800
We're really important in learning as fast as I could.

140
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,900
I was really fortunate to be at a place like buffer, that was like, very transparent in the information that they shared internally.

141
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,700
I had a wonderful boss who was patient with me and, you know, showed me kind of the ropes of what we were doing.

142
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:52,000
And then a company, that was okay, thinking differently about how we could grow and how we want to show up as a business in the market.

143
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,100
And, so I think a lot of it was very serendipitous.

144
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,600
That I started where I did.

145
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,400
That's awesome.

146
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,200
I think all those feelings and emotions learning curves that you mentioned are so real.

147
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,900
And I think so often, you know, especially B2B marketers, just getting into the game.

148
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:20,100
I appreciate your transparency about that process because I think a lot of marketers could feel the way that what you conveyed and learned through.

149
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,200
So yeah, they're not alone.

150
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:27,800
It is a universal feeling in a lot of ways and it's a very isolating job to because like I work, Work.

151
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:33,300
I work remotely and so these things, I am feeling them in my office here.

152
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:41,300
I am not feeling the next to someone at also having those feelings and it's just a it's a feeling that you need to say out loud as much as possible.

153
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,900
So that people know, it's true of other people than just yourself.

154
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,800
Are there communities that you have joined?

155
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,200
I mean, you have created your own.

156
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,500
Are there others that you participate in as well?

157
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:06,200
Yeah, I think that's partially what motivates me to run the newsletter that I run into the present where I am present online, as a way to give back as a way to show folks.

158
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,600
Like I didn't I don't really know much about anything, but this is what I do know.

159
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,700
And if it's helpful for you, like, please, please take it.

160
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,700
So that's yeah, that's been helpful for me.

161
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,000
There have been some slack communities.

162
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,400
I have been part of Those tend to come and go.

163
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:37,700
But it's always nice to just, I tend to be more of a lurker than a valuable contributor but just being able to lurk and see the same of the conversations in there are similar to the things that I am thinking about and wondering about it makes me feel more connected, I guess to the broader marketing community.

164
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:48,800
And then I took some courses early on like reforge is one of my favorite, my favorite programs and that was really helpful to understand like oh I now know.

165
00:19:49,100 --> 00:20:01,700
Like what, the, what the current way of thinking is, and it's not very far off from how I am thinking today, or it was far off, but now I am caught up to where it was, so it was just like a very validating experience and so kind of build some of that into my, my ritual has been helpful.

166
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:24,300
Love that thank you for sharing, so I would like it out Dives Right into our panel or panels are interviewed topic here on brand strategy and how that goes hand in hand, really with the remote team culture, that you are building and you have established.

167
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,100
So, let us start with the brand strategy topic.

168
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,500
I know that you're very well versed in experienced in this area.

169
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,500
You have built differentiating brands in Tech yourself, just curious.

170
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,800
But what brands do you admire, and why?

171
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,900
Yeah, I love b2c brands in general.

172
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:55,100
And so like I am very drawn to, you know, from some really big Brands like Nike to even like the deed is see direct to Consumer space.

173
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:09,200
Like there's so many unique and interesting things happening there, in terms of how they're using storytelling and data to really connect with the very A very late clear picture of who their customer is.

174
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:16,400
I think that's what strikes me about some of the brands that I find appealing as like they are speaking.

175
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:44,700
Such a very clear and direct way to a very clear and direct type of person I think that's really admirable and something that I am always striving to do better at, and so I often look outside of tech for inspiration in that regard but when I do like inside of teca, there're things, you know, endless examples of great Brands and Tech to some of the big ones that I have, as kind of North Stars for me, and my teams are Brands like web flow or figma.

176
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:58,200
But then there's also like really, you know, early stage startups, a seed stage or series either doing some cool things to, as I am always on product hunt to understand like what is, what is the newest and greatest like tool and Technology.

177
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,000
But also how are these tools and Technologies branding themselves, and how they show up in the market?

178
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,500
So that's may be cheating.

179
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
I think I said I Find inspiration everywhere.

180
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:14,100
Essentially, but I, those are where I start when I am looking for, what makes those Brands differentiating to you?

181
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,500
Why are they iconic?

182
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:43,900
Yeah, you know, it's I think of brand as a sum of all the experiences that someone has with your company and so what differentiates them are makes them, iconic is It will sound like beating around the bush with my answer, but I think what's true for me is that it's the experience of these brands that resonates most with me and then experience is hard to like, pinpoint in 2000.

183
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:53,600
It is this exact thing they're doing with their visual identity, like I am over when, when Pitch came out as like this new slide presentation software, like they were using.

184
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,000
What was it?

185
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,800
Like 3D shapes or something, and their visual identity, which is very new and differentiated But that alone wouldn't have really sunk in with me.

186
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:10,900
Like it had to be grounded in a brand strategy and a brand personality and to permeate everything else that pitch does which they do really well.

187
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,700
So that's what draws me, more to a brand, like pitch, its kind of the sum of all the experiences.

188
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:28,600
But usually, the entry point is something may be small in particular, like a visual identity, some copy on a website, maybe some user-generated content, or Word of Mouth that people are talking about this.

189
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
And or the space.

190
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,200
So that's usually like the hook.

191
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,700
And then to really resonate with me, it needs to be like a full, a fully-realized experience.

192
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:37,900
Mmm.

193
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,400
And that takes time to be able to get there and resources.

194
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,200
Yes, it's a big Endeavor, you sure?

195
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,400
Yeah.

196
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:53,700
Because it's not, it's probably not even just marketing building out that experience.

197
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,900
It's with the product.

198
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:06,800
It's with the sales, cuz it's the whole company being Be able to adopt and fully capture the brand experience from your perspective.

199
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:14,300
Like, what has that look like with some of the brands that you have built when you have worked with other team members?

200
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,200
And how do you get that established brand strategy?

201
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,800
And then the alignment across from executive leadership to the org?

202
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,700
Yeah, you're exactly right.

203
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,200
It really is.

204
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,000
Those two phases.

205
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,200
Its can we align on?

206
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,500
What our brand is, what we stand for, how we want to show up in the world.

207
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,800
And then it's the second phase of how consistent are we being in actually following through on this and applying it.

208
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,300
So, you know, they're both very difficult phases.

209
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,400
They're different difficult for different reasons.

210
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:49,000
I think the first phase of defining that brand is needs to be highly collaborative.

211
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,900
It needs to be No, ambitious.

212
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,500
It needs to be grounded in like some very core visceral, feelings, and values.

213
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:08,400
And those things take time to discuss and to hash out with the, with your internal team with market research, or just a lot of different inputs, you need to go into refining that.

214
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,400
And so, I have done that work at buffer and an oyster and for other companies and kind of advisory capacity.

215
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,000
And it's may be as fast as it could be.

216
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,800
Is a 62 10-week process, that is maybe being a bit ambitious, even in like a six-week timeline.

217
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:33,700
And so more often, it's a quarters worth of work to really get to the details into that and get something that you can be confident in as well.

218
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,800
If you don't want to rush out a brand that you don't feel fully bought into either.

219
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,900
So that works really important.

220
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:48,500
I think, for me, it comes down to, you know, starting with the why, why does our company exist and that's often the question that gets answered by the founding team.

221
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Ideally, they had a, why?

222
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
When they started out.

223
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,800
And so, hopefully, that why is compelling enough?

224
00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:05,100
Otherwise, I am happy to come up with a different why that makes sense to so, starting with that Y, and then marrying that to a tension that you find out in the culture and the market at large.

225
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:18,900
And I think that's where a brand can really come to life and resonate in a powerful way when you're connecting this Y, which is often, you know, a personal need or a personal problem that you're solving to this broader.

226
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:25,000
Cultural tension that applies to many other people and can have like some natural scale and resonance to it.

227
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:33,300
So that's, you know, not an easy thing to figure out, but it the closer you get to the heart of your brand and like what your Brand's best self is the easier.

228
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,500
It is to start to notice where those overlaps might be.

229
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
So that's the first phase and the second phase is.

230
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:39,700
Yeah.

231
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,500
The once we figure all this out, how do we make sure we're being consistent about it?

232
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,300
That am I mean that is an ongoing process.

233
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:52,100
I think I have been very lucky that Bufferin at ways to maybe I will share a waster is example.

234
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:59,200
Oyster, we are very aligned on what type of mission we have as a company and how that relates to our brand.

235
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:07,900
So it's very clear alignment and obvious alignment for everyone of what we're trying to do as a company in the short medium, and long term, a twister.

236
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,300
And that's a great place to start from.

237
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,600
So then my challenge is a marketing leader as well.

238
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:22,600
How do I make sure that We are all consistently applying that brand to are our internal experience, our external communication?

239
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,300
Like there's so many different layers of this that permeate every single team within the business.

240
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,100
And if you're not careful about it, as time goes on, you will start to notice.

241
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:41,300
Some people starting to interpret this brand from a slightly different shade and then all of a sudden, you know, six months later, it is an entirely different narrative that you not, you can hardly recognize from where it started with.

242
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,500
And so, I have to keep reminding myself.

243
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,300
I need to be Overly communicative, I need to share more than I think.

244
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,200
I need to share any to repeat.

245
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,900
What might seem very obvious to me just, you know, I think you have to say something seven times before it sinks in.

246
00:27:53,900 --> 00:28:00,400
So I have to say something seven times every month because I think it you know, you lose it after every month to you, need to keep refreshing.

247
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,700
And so it just becomes a very much an always-on process for us.

248
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,400
And we're kind of working through that toy store at the moment.

249
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:26,500
Wow, so even after that first quarter of getting the strategy, Get outta line with executive leadership, communicating out launching it out, even thereafter years after you're still continuing to bring alignment communication.

250
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,600
And I am guessing the brand also evolve May evolve.

251
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,800
And how do you handle that?

252
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:49,400
Yeah, I definitely evolved anywhere in one of those Evolution stages that oyster, at the moment, we're very much about Global Employment today, but we see a path in the future where from More expansive, even Beyond Global Employment into many different aspects of future of work.

253
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,800
And I think it's both a question of how do you, how do you make that transition?

254
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,100
But also, when do you make that transition?

255
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,100
When is the sequencing and timing right to go from A to B?

256
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,400
And I mean, the fortunate thing is there's no, there's no like Playbook to follow.

257
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,500
And so, they're in a sense.

258
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,300
There's no wrong answer to some of this.

259
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,000
I think a lot of it is going into it with eyes wide open and acknowledging.

260
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,500
Like, yes, this is the Trajectory, we need to be on and the steps that need to happen.

261
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,000
And let us I think it's always unique for every company.

262
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,800
And so let us look at the circumstances and understand what makes the most sense for us today.

263
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,100
And so for us, that waster, for instance, we haven't had our employment brand.

264
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,800
I mean, oyster is a two-and-a-half-year-old company in general.

265
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,500
And so the brand hasn't had a lot of time to bake fully yet.

266
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:43,300
Since I think that reason, like, it makes sense to keep going on the employment side, a bit more before you switch gears to something else.

267
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:50,200
But then also, I think you want to do it in a way that isn't jarring for the market as well.

268
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,700
Like, there's a total Rebrand, which is almost like a single point in time we were this thing.

269
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:13,000
And now we're this thing, there's almost like a, like, an ICP, or Persona change where we were about these people and now we're about these people but there's more of like the underlying brand values brand strategy piece, which is maybe not as evident right away to the market.

270
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:21,900
But over time you start to get at this shift into what people are expecting, sometimes that can happen with, you know, we're going to expand our product line from.

271
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,100
We used to sell this thing to we're going to sell it to other thing.

272
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:30,700
You see that a lot with like d to C brands that are selling like I think Obama is the socks company.

273
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:45,800
Like, I know them as a sock company, but they sell t-shirts, and, and underwear and all these different things now, and like, over time, my understanding of that brand is going to evolve, but it wasn't like a single point in time when bomb was like, was like socks from the website.

274
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,700
We're going to go all in on this thing instead.

275
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,300
Like I think is a very natural progression that a lot of brands have to undertake.

276
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,400
And it's not something you want to.

277
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,300
You want to feel like a very abrupt shift if it doesn't have to be in.

278
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,400
So it's an interesting process of.

279
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:12,500
How do you work through design and that way where you're making tweaks, rather than complete overhauls through copy through voice and tone through the images that you use, like there's just a lot of different components that you can kind of sequence, each of those in and of themselves, too.

280
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:37,000
So it's almost like I think about change management and kind of take some of those same principles of how you manage change with people and orgs with your brand as well because things can't be too abrupt or, you know, you can't just say like, all right we're going to rear and tomorrow you know, there's a lot of sequencing, a lot of things involved.

281
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,100
So yeah, thank you for walking us through so going into 2023.

282
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,300
I am seeing some folks talk about investing into their brand.

283
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,000
How do you see it?

284
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,900
Because I know budgets are getting tighter.

285
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:09,900
We have to show, you know, Roi with smaller amounts of spend and you know, hopefully deliver 10x even like 20x out of like less spend is sometimes the pressure that some folks have been communicating.

286
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,700
But what's your sense?

287
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,300
Ahow brand strategy and investing into your brand, can help.

288
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,500
Play into next year's prodigies.

289
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,400
It's an interesting topic.

290
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:33,800
One of the things I often think about with marketing, is its marketing job to be two to three years ahead of the company and that is something that I hope, I hope pretty dire.

291
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:48,500
In terms of that long-term thinking, long-term strategy, and that often gets lost in moments like this, where you're so focused on the near term and You know, next quarter's revenue, or next quarter sleeve volume and is very real-time metrics, essentially.

292
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:57,400
And so, as a market leader, I try to find ways to ensure that I am still including long-term planning into my plans and advocating for that.

293
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,000
And brand is one of those very significant long-term plays for our team and for many marketing teams.

294
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,900
And so that's like the broader lens that I think of it through brand is our greatest.

295
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,600
What's going to help us differentiate and way in a long term and I think it's really important that companies.

296
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:19,400
These are aware of what their long-term strategy is for this for winning, or for growth, whatever the case may be.

297
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:28,200
And so that doesn't necessarily help like, when you get your resource and budget number, and it's smaller than what you expected me have to make some really hard trade-offs.

298
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:36,900
And so, for me, when I am in those conversations, it's become a shift from Brand, being a brand awareness play.

299
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:54,300
Like, that's get as many people to know about oyster or buffer or welcome as possible and it becomes More about how can our brand, how does our brand influence, the sales funnel or the marketing funnel, or the self-serve funnel, like, whatever funnels, you have, because brand does have an influence on that.

300
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:06,700
Oftentimes, it's hard, it's harder to measure than like a direct Roi type measure of Performance Marketing or conversions, things like that, but if you take brand out of that, you will see a lot of your numbers change.

301
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,500
And when you put Brandon to it, you will see all of your numbers improve.

302
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,600
And like if you can get more clarity into what those numbers are, what those are.

303
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,000
Facts are I think it makes the case a little bit easier to invest in Grand.

304
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:31,300
And so that's one of the ways that we have been thinking of it, specifically tying brand to metrics like our LTV or tying it to metrics like our yield on, how much we spend on ads versus how much pipeline we generate or even something like sales velocity.

305
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:37,199
Like in theory, if someone knows and loves your brand, the first conversation is going to be easier than be more likely to move.

306
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,000
The second conversation closing.

307
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It will be easier because whoever they have to get approval from may already know about you and I feel good about you.

308
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,900
So that's where Branch shows up for me and moments like this.

309
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,600
And this is one of the places where I point others to, when I am advocating on behalf of grand.

310
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,000
Hmm, that's really good.

311
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,500
Thanks for sharing that.

312
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:05,500
So for you all, when you get into these planning modes for thinking about the next one year to three years.

313
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
What's that process?

314
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,600
Like are you first having the conversation with your leadership and then do you have like a team?

315
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:18,300
Team, what does the team look like on marketing to be able to execute on a brand strategy?

316
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah.

317
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:29,800
So ideally we have a three to five-year company strategy, which would come from a CEO, or a founding team, or her c-suite leadership team.

318
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:43,800
And that's really helpful to know, like, where do we want to be as a company in three to five years now, because that obviously will dictate what we want, our brand to be three to five years from now, I think what where it gets really challenging as if no one's thinking, three to five years ahead.

319
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:56,300
And he was a market leader of the only one thinking, three to five years ahead, then all of a sudden I know, I have been in places like that where I am putting up strategies together and like is anyone actually going to agree with me about this direction?

320
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:01,400
I am saying we should go in 23 years and so that is a challenge.

321
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:11,400
I, so I say if you don't have that definitely push for it or ask for it within your team and Company to have that company long-term Vision to ground your brand strategy.

322
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:18,500
And but then from there is its a lot of going back to that company strategy is doing market research.

323
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
And understand like where are the trends today?

324
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:27,400
And how they evolved over the past two to three years and almost like projecting out where you think they could be two to three years.

325
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:37,200
Now, it's important to bring as many data in as you can, but there's always going to be a pretty hefty dose of qualitative input into like a three to five-year Vision document for brand.

326
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:45,900
And then involving your team is really helpful to like, can you get insights from your product marketing team since they know the markets so well, and they know customers.

327
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:54,400
While can, you get inside some growths team on what channels are I am the best and even how Channel performance has evolved over the past couple of years, and they evolve into the future.

328
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:02,800
Once you have all those inputs, usually a brand strategy becomes a bit more clear to see Mmm, that's good.

329
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,500
Okay.

330
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,700
And if anybody has any questions, feel free to drop them in the Q&A tab.

331
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,400
I would love to transition our conversation.

332
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:19,900
Speaking about teams talking about how you are building a pretty awesome, team culture from what I have heard from your teammates.

333
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:30,200
So, you know, just FYI, you have got that good third-party feedback, coming out your leadership and the team Dynamic that you have built over at oyster.

334
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,400
Currently, how many team members do you have on the marketing team?

335
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,600
What is, what is your org look like?

336
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:45,200
And yeah, how do you manage them a week to week?

337
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,300
I would love to hear about just your, you know what?

338
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,000
What does workflow look and feel like?

339
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,200
Yeah.

340
00:37:52,200 --> 00:38:00,100
So, we're a 50-person marketing team today 50, and we have, I guess, where you can consider a matrix marketing organs.

341
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,700
So, we have Pillars of brand marketing, product, marketing, and growth marketing.

342
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:33,700
And then we have to supporting layers of content and design and then as we have kind of scaled to the team size right now, we were able to carve out a group called strategic projects that which works on most like startup within a start-up kind of ideas as well as business operations, which has helped us a lot and of organizing ourselves and our processes, and they're hoping everything runs smoother and so it's been a steep learning curve for me like T people is a lot of wonderful people to get to work with.

343
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:39,400
So I learned a lot about how to I am still learning a lot about how to manage, all that.

344
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,400
I guess like to get people moving in the same direction.

345
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:50,000
I think has been a really interesting puzzle to solve, and so we have a number of different rituals that we use to.

346
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
I hope a good effect.

347
00:38:51,400 --> 00:39:05,900
I don't know what the word of mouth would be on my team's feelings about the rituals, but I have enjoyed putting them in place, and if I don't know if this complicates it or makes it easier, I often think this makes it a bit easier, but it might not sound that way, but we are a very asynchronous call.

348
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:16,500
Our oyster and so we don't spend a lot of time in synchronous meetings discussing strategy or checking in like a lot of that happens in a Google Document or in slack or in the ocean.

349
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:35,800
And so that for me has helped because I am able to document a lot of the thoughts that come out of my head or come out of my chats of the marketing leadership team or come out of different parts of the business document that and then put it in a place where people can access it on their own terms at their own time and kind of on demand.

350
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:44,100
Moving forward, and so I think that helps when you get to a certain scale where you have information easily accessible for people whenever they need it and want it.

351
00:39:45,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So that's been a help I think as we have scaled, and we have also been very deliberate about putting our strategy down on paper working in a sauna for project management is that we start from strategic planning to move all that into a sauna for project management.

352
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,800
We also use a sign up for goal tracking, then we have a biweekly live stand up.

353
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:21,200
We all get together to discuss performance to date but also use that time to connect as a team to highlight other voices on the team, so they can share like work in progress or deep dives into their areas and feel like we're again moving in the same direction.

354
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:28,500
Honestly, I am really grateful for the leaders that I have on my team because so much of managing a 50-person team happens when I am not there.

355
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,400
And when I have no idea what's going on in.

356
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,700
So, like in the individual departs, like sub departments within marketing.

357
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,900
There's so much good work.

358
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,800
That happens with those.

359
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:41,300
Dividual teams and their cultures in terms of moving in the same direction, communication team building.

360
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:51,000
And so, it becomes especially important to be a good manager of managers when you get to the scale because you won't have direct contact with the majority of the folks in your organic more.

361
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,000
That's great.

362
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:03,900
And I am curious like what are some of those challenges that you have run into where you have had to problem solve and figure it out?

363
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,100
Yeah, we have a few, there's always a few.

364
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:16,000
So one of the ones is I think it's due to this concept that I have called push-and-pull.

365
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,600
So we have a cremation.

366
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,800
We're very, very many documentarians with an oyster.

367
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:28,500
And so, a lot of information is available for folks to look and see and I will probably incorrectly often come to the assumption that.

368
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,300
Well, it's in the here.

369
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:34,100
So of course, people know to look here and you know, people probably don't know to look there.

370
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:40,200
They No, they don't look somewhere but there's so many places to look at so many things to read it just doesn't get read or doesn't get seen.

371
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:48,200
It doesn't get like fully integrated into their plans and strategies and so that's one of the risks that we have as an asynchronous culture.

372
00:41:48,200 --> 00:42:04,500
And as a team of our size is that we have important things that we are putting in a synchronous document that might not resonate or even be seen by as many people as we think they're being feeling consumed by plus one on one when risk, another thing that's popped up.

373
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,100
Recently.

374
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,700
Is that during the planning phase?

375
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:14,400
We have a concept of these are, you know, the five to 10, big projects that we want to do as a team over the next quarter.

376
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:21,100
But, you know, for a 50-person team, you can do 5 to 10 big projects that still have a ton of, you know, either always on work.

377
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:21,600
That's happening.

378
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
Anyway or additional work.

379
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,400
Like there's lots of bandwidths to do some really great stuff.

380
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,600
And so how do you prioritize almost like the second layer priorities?

381
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:49,000
Beneath the 5210, big things and often times when the It's about is in the production areas, like content or design or marketing operations, or lifecycle or website, like these creative units that are needing to build infrastructure or create assets and things like that.

382
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,200
And so, we felt some crunch there to have, like, it's clear with the big things that we're working on.

383
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:00,300
What does that mean for everything else that we can work on and want to work on and maybe should be working on as well?

384
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,800
And so, we haven't necessarily solve that puzzle yet, but we're aware.

385
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,500
It is a puzzle.

386
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:17,200
How to solve at the moment, I think it's huge that your team members can even bring these things up and there's that trust and transparency to.

387
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:27,600
It sounds like quickly surface any challenges and you know even if it's not resolved ASAP like we're working together to figure it out.

388
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:38,000
So how have you have established that level of collaboration transparency See, you know, how did you create that kind of culture?

389
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,500
That is a good question.

390
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,000
I think I should ask him my teammates at what they think was successful to get there.

391
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:55,900
Like I do believe that Like, I always try to build teams with trust respect and affirmation is some of the core values of the teams that I am building.

392
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:05,900
So the fact that trust is so front and center for me, I think does kind of work through a lot of the different connection points that I have with my team?

393
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,700
Whether it's consciously or subconsciously, as I am doing it.

394
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:14,800
And so, as an example, the way that I lead and manage people is very, very open.

395
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,400
It's very, I give a lot of autonomy to folks.

396
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,000
I am often asking for feedback or very receptive to feedback when it's shared.

397
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:33,900
I think that builds a certain amount of safety in sharing your feedback with No, with your boss or manager or team Lee.

398
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,600
Like, I think that psychological safety is really important.

399
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,700
So I do that a lot to the, the way that I manage those, I try to do that through the way that I manage.

400
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,500
We also have regular surveys that we do both at the company level.

401
00:44:46,500 --> 00:45:01,500
But then we're also often asking the team for feedback at like, a stand-up or in stock, and then the important thing is to ask, but then to return the results to people, so they see that, oh, this person asked this saw the results, and this is the action that you're From them.

402
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:17,400
So we just did our queue for employee engagement survey as the company and marketing's results were sent to me in the market leadership team, and we kind of had a chance to talk about all this, but then we were like, well let us ask the team what they think about these results to, and so we share the results with the team.

403
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,900
And then ask them, these are the themes that we noticed from your feedback.

404
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,400
Did we get it right?

405
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:27,500
And if not let us know, but if so like what do you think you would like to see happen?

406
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,600
Next, as a result of this and take their thoughts into Duration with that.

407
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:48,500
And, so I think those I guess those processes and systems really do help to build that psychological safety in the build a culture where it's okay to give feedback you know, up down or horizontal, and so we're lucky that has been the case for us so far, that's awesome.

408
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,600
Thanks for sharing.

409
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,400
All right we have got a couple of questions actually coming through.

410
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,600
So let us go ahead and pull up and question.

411
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,000
What are some marketing tactics you have used too successfully?

412
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Bring awareness to Brand you worked on?

413
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,100
And is there anything you tried?

414
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,400
That didn't work like you thought it would.

415
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:10,800
Yeah.

416
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:19,900
So the ones that have worked really well for us at waster, have been our PR and our thought leadership and our social media work.

417
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,200
And we have seen some really impressive scale from those channels.

418
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:33,000
So specifically, when it comes to getting placements in Tier 1, Yeah, that's four different stories that we want to tell and then using our either our own profile.

419
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:48,300
So like our oyster LinkedIn profile or using the profiles of some of our most influential people within the company, like our CEO or a founding team or some of our leaders and thinking of them, almost as brand ambassadors and putting together content strategy and thought leadership behind them.

420
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:53,200
We have seen some really powerful scale for the brand to that one of the next steps.

421
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,300
There's then to tie that into like a full, I guess you could think of it as an employee.

422
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,500
Agassi the strategy.

423
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,800
And so, how do you get the hundreds of people who work at oyster?

424
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:08,700
Also, sharing on LinkedIn or Twitter or Tick, Tock, or whatever the case may be on behalf of your brand and the things in the stories that are important to you.

425
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:15,800
And so, that's, that's kind of really large scale, sustainable way to move the brand.

426
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:29,400
We have also spent money on the brand and so events is a really big lever for us to being very targeted to which events resonate most with your target audience, or which events resonate with Because the way you want to be perceived in the market.

427
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:36,100
And so the difference for us in that case is we want to show up at HR events because we are an HR Tech platform.

428
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,100
I always stir, and so we have a presence there, but then we also want to be known as Innovative.

429
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,600
We want to make kind of splash in the Silicon Valley seems.

430
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:51,600
So we're showing up at Tech events, likes a stir or web Summit as well because it connects our brand with kind of has this bigger Zeitgeist around Tech.

431
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,600
So those have been helpful for us, I would say on the side that hasn't worked as well.

432
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,300
We have done some, some very initial testing and out-of-home advertising which I think can work.

433
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:25,900
Well if you get the strategy right but it requires a certain amount of investment to really an investment and belief and time like to really let that sink in and to get it to work the way you want to, when we did it, we advertised on some Billboards in San Francisco and the primary benefit of that for us is we could take a picture of it and share it on LinkedIn.

434
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:32,100
It was almost like a social proof thing more so than an actual brand Impressions or brain consideration kind of play.

435
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,400
So that would be.

436
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,100
I would be somewhat careful about that.

437
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:41,600
But otherwise, it's, you know, I think for us it's a lot of, it depends on what is the goal of your brand?

438
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:47,800
Like, if you're going after brand impression doesn't number, then yes, channels like PR social media.

439
00:48:47,800 --> 00:49:00,100
Make a lot of sense because of the scale, if you After more of like a brand consideration aspects that may be something like a podcast, which is a bit more intimate than maybe doesn't scale, to as many eyes or ears in that case.

440
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:06,100
I think you can be very, very specific and targeted based on what outcome you want to drive for your brand.

441
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,200
It's great.

442
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:17,400
We have got another question from Spencer in this time of justifying marketing, spend improving Roi.

443
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,400
How do you show the value of brand marketing?

444
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,400
Great question.

445
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,300
It's it gets tricky and I think a lot of it depends on what is most important to.

446
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,100
What is most important to the people who are most important that your company is?

447
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:46,200
So that's probably the CEO but in some cases it might be like a Chief Financial Officer clo or just whatever the hierarchy looks like it company like what are the things that matter the most to those folks and how do you connect brand to them?

448
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,300
And so it has a general rule.

449
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:53,700
I would say connecting Brands to any sort of efficiency metric today is going to be really helpful.

450
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:00,300
Like I mentioned earlier, that could be something like LTV or yield sale.

451
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,900
Lost city is another example.

452
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:08,000
So connecting it back to these metrics that help you get more efficient with your spend, with your acquisition.

453
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,900
That's one way that I have seen it.

454
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:15,700
Be really effective, but I have also seen it be effective with kind of broader company's strategic decisions.

455
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:21,400
Like if you want to go after category, creation is like your one long-term strategy that you have a high belief in.

456
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,500
Then how do you connect your brand work to category creation that case?

457
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,300
Maybe it is the organic search volume for a particular keyword.

458
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:37,200
Word or maybe it is the number of reviews you get in this certain review website on this certain category term.

459
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:43,900
And so, I think you can marry it to whatever the company strategy is or whatever is most important to the company.

460
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,500
At a time, when I would probably default to an efficiency metric in the meantime.

461
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:54,700
Some of the, like, always on brand goals that we have for, for us, a twister is, what is are aided recall?

462
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:58,100
So running an aided recall survey on brand awareness out the market.

463
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,900
What is the free traffic to our Website?

464
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,400
And so how many people are coming direct to our website?

465
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,800
How many people are being referred to our website?

466
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:11,100
So clicking on a link that someone else said about Western coming here or what is like or organic.

467
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:20,200
Search volume both for like any relevant search term, but it's even more specifically for Brandon Search terms like how many people are typing oyster?

468
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:25,400
Oyster HR oyster Global Employment into a search engine and finding us that way.

469
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,900
So those are kind of like the always on one side.

470
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:33,400
We look at as well as share a voice which is more of a market, share kpi.

471
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,000
Those arms are kind of always on.

472
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,400
There we go.

473
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,700
For the next one.

474
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,300
Yeah, it's a tricky one.

475
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,500
We use Blended share of voice for the market, share one.

476
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:51,000
And so we're measuring across paid search, social PR in organic search.

477
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:57,300
And this shirt like the specific percentage of she avoids, very some differently, across all four of them.

478
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,600
So we're trying to find a way to blend them into like one metric.

479
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,400
But in general, we usually based it on how many competitors we have their space.

480
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,200
And so we have two main competitors in our space and so if you think of if All equal.

481
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,100
We should all have 33 percent share of the market.

482
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:17,100
So we want more than 33 percent is the way we would goal ourselves in that case.

483
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,500
That's great.

484
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,400
Alright wow, like I need to play back.

485
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:29,400
This recording is there so much that you shared with us and believe or not.

486
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:35,700
We only have like five minutes left before we wrap up, Kevin.

487
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,600
I know that you have got a job board and you have got resources.

488
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,700
And so we have got some links here.

489
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,300
Your palate.com or can I go ahead and share?

490
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:48,500
Sure.

491
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,100
That it is there.

492
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:56,700
Anything else that as a marketing Community we could learn benefit from with the resources you currently have.

493
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,300
Yeah, that's a great one.

494
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,600
Yeah, you're welcome to share that link.

495
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,500
So this is a jobs board for remote.

496
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,500
Jobs in particular, remote marketing jobs.

497
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:13,400
You're welcome to just check out the link there and look at the jobs and hopefully it's helpful for you or someone in your network if they're looking for work.

498
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:23,900
But also, if you want to apply to be part of what's called a Within that transport, it just helps me make introductions or connections to hiring companies as well.

499
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:28,000
If you're currently in the job market or looking for your next opportunity.

500
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,200
So would love to support you in that way.

501
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:36,900
If that's helpful for you, if you do, subscribe to the newsletter, you will get to hear from me once a week.

502
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,300
You can unsubscribe anytime.

503
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:42,100
If you get tired of hearing from me once a week, but you can get some resources there.

504
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:55,200
I am often sharing their stories from oyster or buffer, sharing resources that were using sharing Ideas that are on my head and so, it's very much like a real time look into the stuff that matters to me at the moment.

505
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:04,000
And then there is a paid app head section of that newsletter, which gives you access to my personal notion workspace, which has a bunch of different templates and play books and things.

506
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:13,500
They're all the proceeds from that newsletter, go to a non-profit that's helping to bring more or folks of underrepresented groups into Tech.

507
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:19,500
So, if you're welcome to subscribe there and get access to notion as well, That's amazing.

508
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:20,600
All right.

509
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:36,100
Kevin with the wrap up, is there one word of encouragement or advice that you could leave the B2B a community with Yeah, I probably tie it back to where we started, which is, I came from a very non-traditional background into Tech.

510
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:44,600
And I think that non-traditional background is something that can resonate very deeply in a very crowded and noisy B2B marketing space.

511
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:51,200
And so embrace the non-traditional, think outside the box, go big, go wild.

512
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,900
Like we have a saying, like, we celebrate moonshots and roof shots.

513
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:01,400
So, as long as you have some moonshots in addition to all the Roof shots the validating the stuff that you're doing.

514
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,700
Like, I think that is that makes for a really good mix and then just feel free to be bold with it.

515
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,400
I think that's where a lot of great performance comes from, a might be harder to measure.

516
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:18,700
Might be harder to tie directly back to some sort of Roi, but it's worth it to get your brand and your product heard out in the market today.

517
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,100
Love that.

518
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,200
Thank you so much.

519
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,300
Kevin, we appreciate you.

520
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:31,400
We're so grateful for everything you're investing into the community and so all the best to you and your team your endeavors.

521
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,900

525
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,000
All right.

526
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:46,500
Well with that, our next event is taking place next week, so we are going to be interviewing Alex from Saros.

527
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:56,700
He is the director of digital marketing, and it's going to be a great conversation on really looking at content and figuring out.

528
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:01,700

Homie tiger, and Get your people and State.

10
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,300
Okay, cool.

11
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,800
Okay.

12
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,300
Screen share.

1
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,500
Did a full 180 crazy?

2
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,700
Don't show up.

3
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
Anything could stop me.

4
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,200
Hello everyone and welcome.

5
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,300
I am seeing people are tuning in from not so sunny places from sunny places.

6
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:47,100
It don't matter, you're tuned in, you are here with us today, and that makes us so happy and Overjoyed to have you.

7
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,700
As today's panel discussion, is going to be really hot.

8
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,600
We have got John Miller.

9
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,300
Who is the CMO demand base?

10
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,500
Nate Dame.

11
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,900
The CEO profound.

12
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:07,400
G + MK, the CMO of Loop and tie to talk about the expertise of the joint synergies of ABM and SEO.

13
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,400
So this is going to be a really great discussion with these experts.

14
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,800
You know, B2B buyers we know this 2023.

15
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:28,200
They want personalized self guided experiences, according to this recent stat by trust radius, 87 percent of buyers want the ability to self serve.

16
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,300
Or all of their buying Journey.

17
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,100
87%, okay.

18
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:40,600
Buyers, love it because then they can take their own time and Pace to explore research and purchase on their own terms.

19
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,600
We're seeing those touch points prior to conversion, go up, especially over the last couple of years.

20
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:57,600
And so if SEO and ABM are created in silos and isolated from another, which can happen often times, then these important parts of the buyers process.

21
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,700
It doesn't get the feedback that you need from sales.

22
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,900
There's a lot of other things, I am not the expert on this.

23
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,200
So this is what I want to unpack with our panel today.

24
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,800
So before that, we're going to take a quick poll and let us pull that up it.

25
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,700
I just want to get a check here.

26
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:26,700
How many of you are currently leveraging your SEO and ABM in conjunction with one another?

27
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,300
Go ahead and just drop your votes there.

28
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,200
All right.

29
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,600
Okay, so we see a much greater percentage oh kind of sort.

30
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,600
As we got some maybes and some nose and not as much of the yeses.

31
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:50,200
Okay, all right, all right, well with that, I would love to introduce our wonderful speakers to the stage.

32
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Come enjoy a beer.

33
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Hello, hello.

34
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,200
Hi there.

35
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,900
How's it going?

36
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,500
John 8 MK.

37
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,300
So, great to see where each of you tuning in from.

38
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,400
And could you give us a little introduction?

39
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,600
I will start with you, John?

40
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,300
Yeah.

41
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,300
Hey folks, glad to talk to you.

42
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,800
I am in Burlingame, California, a little South of San Francisco.

43
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,400
I have been in the Mart tech industry for years and years.

44
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:28,800
I was a co-founder of Marketo I was the CEO and founder of a company called engage you in about two and a half years ago, we merge engage you and demand base to create the leading ABM platform.

45
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,900
And now everyone is the CMO there.

46
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,299
I worked with at least one of our other panelists met Fred Marketo and engage you.

47
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh, so it's really great to have the opportunity to chat with him on this panel, as well.

48
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
And where are you tuning in?

49
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,000
From what city Burlingame.

50
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,700
California, a little South of San Francisco.

51
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Nice.

52
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
All right, I will hand it over to you.

53
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,700
Nate.

54
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,100
Sure.

55
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,100
I am in Lake Geneva.

56
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,700
Wisconsin.

57
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,000
Southeast Wisconsin.

58
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,200
Just above Chicago.

59
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,000
Someone already chatted.

60
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
I am not a Packer fan.

61
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,800
I am a Chicago transplant.

62
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,500
Wisconsin.

63
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,000
So I am a die-hard Bears fan.

64
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,500
Although my kids have been stolen over the Packer side.

65
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,600
It's a sad story.

66
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,300
Yeah, John and I worked together years and years.

67
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,100
For quite a while.

68
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Marketo, I run an agency called profound strategy or an SEO results partner, we go high-growth scalable predictable, SEO campaigns for technology companies.

69
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,800
Amazing.

70
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,000
It looks like we just lost MK.

71
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,300
So whenever she jumps back on, well, there you are.

72
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Presto change-o, seems you said money.

73
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,600
Yes.

74
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,800
83 times usually for me to appear but I gave you two.

75
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,300
Gotcha.

76
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,000
Hey, okay, so where are you tuning in from and could you give us a little intro?

77
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,800
I am not tuning in from anywhere.

78
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,400
Nearly as cool as California.

79
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,700
But I am dialing in from Rhode Island today, where we are expecting some snow in a tiny estate.

80
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:00,900
Here in the US, I am the CM 0 here at loop antenna, and I am thrilled to be able to talk to you about Pat top.

81
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,100
I said I am particularly passionate About in a, a VM and SEO.

82
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,100
Awesome, thank you.

83
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,000
All right, well, we're going to jump right into some of our questions here.

84
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:25,000
You know, it was interesting to see those results from that poll where majority of us are probably kinda sorta or not at all, using ABM and SEO in conjunction.

85
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:35,300
So one of my first questions is, where do you start with even thinking about bringing a BM strategy and SEO strategy in alignment?

86
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
And I am going to hand this over.

87
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,200
Huge on initially to kick it off.

88
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Yeah, you know, I mean back when I was starting engage, you know, I used to use this analogy to describe a VM, you know, I talked about the sort of inbound manj and kind of marketing.

89
00:10:50,200 --> 00:11:08,800
We did, it Marketo is fishing with Nets where we'd run our campaigns, and we didn't really care which fish, we caught we just cared if we caught enough fish, whereas ebm is what I like fishing with the spear, where would go identify the big fish that we really wanted, and we would reach out to them kind of proactively.

90
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:18,800
Yeah, and in those early days, you know whether I was intending to are not, I think I was purposely setting up sort of either-or dichotomy, right?

91
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,400
You're either fishing with Nets or you're fishing with Spears, you know, and I think a lot of people struggled with that a little bit.

92
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,300
However, fast-forward.

93
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,900
Gosh, seven plus years later.

94
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,000
I have come to learn that.

95
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,700
That's its more nuanced than that.

96
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:47,400
And what you actually have is something that looks more, like a spectrum of different go-to-market styles, you know, ranging from truly bespoke 1, to 1 atm.

97
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,200
You know, for deals that might be worth 2 million, 10 million, 500 million dollars a year.

98
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,500
You know, or if they talk about 12 few, which is good for deals, maybe half a million a year or so.

99
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:22,000
Um and then one too many ABMs which is appropriate for say a hundred fifty thousand or two hundred fifty thousand dollar deals and then you even have you know, just targeted demand gen where maybe you 50,000 Dollar Deals where, you know, you have a pretty wide universe of companies you're going after but you still want to be a little relevant targeted.

100
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,400
And a lot of companies span across these different deal points.

101
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,300
And so, I think, rather than thinking about it is an ATM strategy or demand gen strategy.

102
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,500
I think the beginning, your to answer your question, specifically about, how do you start by building an AVM strategy?

103
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,100
Aligns with your SEO strategy is to realize they aren't in Conflict.

104
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:52,100
You know, you have one go-to-market strategy, which happens to span different styles and which you just got, you're going to use different tactics for different kinds of deals.

105
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:01,900
And as we will talk about more, you know, some of the tactics and to being very complimentary that's great.

106
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,900
I think it's great.

107
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
I think it's spot on.

108
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,600
And to be honest John has built a framework for thinking about a VM that's still so relevant.

109
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,900
In fact, I saved his engage eoe book and pull it up again.

110
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:25,500
Yesterday, talking to my team about our own AVM programs, our doing scale campaigns to micro segment today, and we're talking about a strategic level Campaign, straight out of John's ebook.

111
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,900
So anything this guy says about a VM is tends to be pure gold.

112
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,700
What's interesting is thinking about, sorry to be over the top.

113
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:40,400
Top John but what's interesting about SEO, and we want SEO to sit next to a BM SEO.

114
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,300
Could be seen as a huge net and ABM could be seen as a spear.

115
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:59,600
And, so I think it's also important to think that these two things should coordinate, but they don't necessarily serve each other exclusively, SEO, conserve, a lot of broad purposes that might tie closer to brand or tie into other objectives.

116
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,200
To just be present when your buyers ask questions, May even be a strategy to plug leaks in a high scale.

117
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,500
ABM program, where you still have a leaky bucket.

118
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:18,000
I just be because people are searching questions as we do on Google, and they find answers that your competitors have answered.

119
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,400
And you got to be there too.

120
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,900
So they can tie together, but they're also quite distinct in the end the spectrum of how you might design your programs.

121
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,300
I love that.

122
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,300
I think when you also meet you're using SEO as I have wide.

123
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:40,600
Expansive, net SEO, coupled with the right engagement tactics through your avian strategy can also be the bait.

124
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,400
So not only your dredging, the ocean floor with some of your SEO strategy, at the highest level of intent.

125
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,300
In your keyword search, you can also be getting a lot more granular with that keyword searching.

126
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,500
How you start optimizing site pages to be hunting down certain fish, so that you can have them in close range?

127
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:05,200
To shoot with your sphere with a BMI think we teased our, the oceanic and fishing and metaphor to its fullest extent.

128
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,800
Right, that's good.

129
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:32,900
I definitely see that complement complementary nature in the way, each of you are describing a VM and SEO and how they can work together, you know, I think about the buyers journey, and from here's my qualified opportunity and then all the way through to conversion and Even post sale, could we get a little bit Technical and that flow?

130
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:40,300
How do you see ABM and SEO working together from even before qualify table?

131
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Like what's that whole experience from awareness all the way through Yeah, I mean I mainly that off.

132
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,000
That's okay.

133
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,000
Sorry.

134
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,500
If MK4 about to speak there, you know?

135
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:59,700
I mean I sort of think I mentioned tactics that were complimentary you know, so I think the first one is there's this concept of.

136
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,700
What's people talk about his intent data, which is a really key part of ABM intent?

137
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,900
Data is your.

138
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:15,800
When you can sort of see what topics your target accounts are researching and reading about.

139
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,600
Out on the open web, I can get into more about how that data is figured out.

140
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:36,300
But, so I think Step 1, Campari tactic is when you have identified your target accounts, using 10 data, to see what topics that read about what keywords they talked about and then that's a pretty good Kion, kind of what you should be focusing, your SEO strategies on.

141
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:45,700
I think second when you, when company comes like a little further down the funnel, a company comes to your website.

142
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,200
You know, 98% of the time, they're going to be anonymous, right?

143
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,400
They just Googled something and they found you another F.

144
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,000
ABM tactic is to DN optimize that web traffic.

145
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,500
You don't, you're not going to hear who the person is, but you can figure out what company they work for based on their IP address and their cookie.

146
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:11,000
And if you see that this is coming to your site and it is a target account, you know.

147
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,300
Now you can actually personalize that webpage to recognize them.

148
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,400
Maybe you just the content based on their industry or other things, you know about them.

149
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:31,700
So you're being more relevant and more personalized for that kind of organic traffic and then last, you know, late in the sales cycle, to me that's all about validation and consensus.

150
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,900
Making the hiring committee feel safe with this purchase.

151
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:53,700
You know, and I think you can often times you're going to have some buyers like an executive who hasn't really been involved with the buying committee whose like, hey, what's this demand-based thing that were purchasing, you know, and they're going to answer that by typing something into Google and see what comes up.

152
00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:01,200
So making sure that your SEO strategies also include late-stage validation, I think would be a third tactic.

153
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,000
I talk about okay.

154
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,900
Looked like you were going to speak right?

155
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:18,100
When I started talking there, I mean you, you summarize it so beautifully, the only, yes, and they have to the framework that you put out there for folks, to look at is also bifurcating.

156
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,700
Some of the data points you have with folks who have boots on the ground talking with your customers.

157
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:34,000
Obviously, I think one of the most important stakeholders in any of your ABM, or ABX strategies, or your sales team that you get to work alongside with, but I actually find it really interesting to spend time.

158
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:42,000
Working with your customer basing teams post-sale to understand a lot more about what is really compelling and helpful for them post.

159
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,500
So where they get hung up, where they get stuck on either product adoption, where they start to gain traction.

160
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,700
That time to Value multiplier.

161
00:18:50,700 --> 00:19:04,000
To post sale is a really interesting way to build a top-down SEO strategy, starting all the way from awareness coming all the way down to decision to understand how to maximize that time to Value quotient.

162
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,400
For your customers.

163
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,300
Success teams?

164
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,200
Yeah, good point points.

165
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,400
It's interesting.

166
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:23,200
I think the intent data is one of the most valuable B, I know, and we're working with clients for kind of sometimes, looking over the fence like, oh, well, your will your ABM, your marketing team over there.

167
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,000
Give us that intent data as well.

168
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,900
We want to just tap into that pipe, it transfers to SEO.

169
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,400
You can think about intent data.

170
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:46,400
When you look at keywords, we think it's important to level that up a bit when you're doing your then getting tactical that Co so you know exactly what you're targeting exactly what you're getting and that Actually tie really well, even to last-minute, validation, with Executives.

171
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:57,500
There's this interesting Trend where many tech companies seem to have this user need at that, we call an SEO, this user need like, what is a BM for Adam and base?

172
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,000
What is what our webinars are?

173
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
What is a webinar platform?

174
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,500
Maybe for something like, welcome, what do they be?

175
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
I am gifting for something like Loop and tie.

176
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,200
What is the name of your category and there's an intent, or we call it a user need far more?

177
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:19,700
Avec than the intent and a modern SEO program will can hone in on the user needs that matter and sometimes he's this Wild Thing Happened.

178
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:26,200
So for many B2B tech companies that we worked with these highly generic user needs their specifically.

179
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:47,000
What is the topic, their core vertical will find that, you know, no one wants a Target that because it's generic a high level, but we often advocate for it and because time and again, we find the highest Revenue attribution to those pages when they gain traffic and earn traffic and keep it.

180
00:20:47,100 --> 00:21:11,200
We see the highest revenue attribution to those pages and our best consensus it from that is we don't find those pages generating leads predominantly early in the process, but I seem to be gaining that attribution late in the stage, or when our best assumption here, the data is hard to always specify, it's a it gets messy, right?

181
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:11,800
Right?

182
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,800
But it's that it really seems like executives are doing exactly.

183
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,000
Like, John, described.

184
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
What's ABM again?

185
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,500
Oh, let me, let me Google it.

186
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,300
Oh, and I got a great answer and by that answer, by the way that answer came from demand base.

187
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,500
So yeah, let us move forward done with that.

188
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
What's my next decision?

189
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,300
So good.

190
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:38,900
Wow, just a Sal had said if there're any questions that, any of you have, feel free to drop them in the Q&A tab, as we're rolling here.

191
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:51,300
So what it comes to optimization throughout that occur throughout the entire funnel, how do you see ABM and SEO working in compliment?

192
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:57,800
I assume that there's going to be feedback loops and how does that happen on a week-to-week monthly?

193
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:09,200
With, but the teams Yeah, I mean they saw you got this one.

194
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,800
Sure.

195
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,700
I think that the right mechanisms are important to the right feedback.

196
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,000
Loops are important rate schedule.

197
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,900
The right, Cadence.

198
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Most importantly, I would say that each program needs to have its own established goals and objectives which are probably not the same.

199
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:37,800
And then we're asking the question to say, how can, you know, now that we're say it's two people running each program, how can we help each other reach your Everett goals by collaborating, right?

200
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,100
I think it's a mistake to say, well, we got these two programs, they should work together and Magic will happen.

201
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,400
We used to hear that all the time.

202
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,500
And sometimes we still do.

203
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:51,600
If you do SEO and you do paid search and like you coordinate them, it's the silver bullet and often.

204
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,400
It's not, I mean, you can do a lot of work that we don't fight.

205
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:02,900
We haven't found a way as or it's like this Silver Bullet of just magical explosion of leads or Revenue, anything, you know that you can coordinate.

206
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,600
So I think maybe I am an SEO.

207
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,800
Aim separate objectives to contribute to higher level company, objectives, and the question for the teams.

208
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:28,000
And for leaders, helping those teams collaborate is, how can these two programs help there, you know, coordinate to help their individual goals being achieved better and that should be the question that drives collaboration and should drive the Cadence should drive how, you know, obviously to share all the data.

209
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You can, you know, make decisions via the written word publish your conversations, you know, don't just have a rambling meeting.

210
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:43,800
Things but use the written material and use document of material so that it's much easier for others to see what's happening and jump in and jump out of different context.

211
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,100
But ultimately the, the goal of collaboration should be.

212
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:52,200
Hey, can you share something so that each team's goals can be reached faster and better?

213
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah, plus a million to that.

214
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I love to think about to what could see be seemingly.

215
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:07,700
Disparate tactics like SEO and sem or sorry, an ABM have mutually shared kpi's.

216
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:17,100
So you have your discrete performance metrics that really, are you roll up metrics the overarching company successes Nate said but there should be mutually own kpi's.

217
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:27,500
I think one really important one is conversion rate, optimization metrics and understanding more about the Enter the audience, that's coming and then how that intent is actually yielding conversions.

218
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,800
And ABM obviously spending a lot of time thinking about conversions and how to get high quality High intent, folks over and into the hand of the sales team.

219
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:50,100
So, by appointing, some of those mutually shared kpis, there's a lot of really good Synergy and how the teams come together to collaborate and share this, Mutual goal to drive forward and actually start to orient themselves around.

220
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,200
One another's discipline.

221
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,300
Sookie.

222
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,200
Right there.

223
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,100
The, the alignment of those objectives.

224
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,400
John did, you have something to add to that?

225
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,400
I have talked a lot already.

226
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:04,900
All right.

227
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,600
Well, we have got a question that came through that I think is also relevant from Jose.

228
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Do you have a framework or template?

229
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,500
That you can share to map, SEO, content, efforts to the ABM Journey.

230
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:42,900
I am going to I mean to me that does start back to the intent keywords and I mean if you get one, you get really sophisticated, you could look at the keywords that the accounts in your kind of early stages, what I would call a qualified or awareness stages.

231
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,200
Are using and are those keywords different from an account?

232
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,700
That's deeper like consideration.

233
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:00,100
What I might call marketing qualified account, you know, and those might be different keywords that the ones late in the stage or using.

234
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,200
And again, this is sort of the magic of intent data.

235
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,600
Are you can actually see what kinds of topics and articles your accounts are reading about?

236
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,100
Out that's how I might think about that.

237
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,800
John could you dive into that a little bit more?

238
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,900
How do you see that with demand Base today?

239
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Like if you were too just to give us some examples of your buyers and what their intent search looks like order?

240
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,300
What does that experience look like?

241
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,800
I want to show me answer the question properly here soon every company that provides intend data follows.

242
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:46,500
The same basic algorithm, you know, it's basically you have got a person on a webpage and step one is UD, anonymize that person's company you know.

243
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:55,900
And again you don't know who that individual is because that would be not part, you know, breaking privacy, you know, ethics if you will but it's okay to figure out what company they work for.

244
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,800
And then you can do some natural language processing on the page.

245
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,700
And lo and behold.

246
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,700
You see, huh?

247
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,400
This person from Dell is researching event Solutions.

248
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,600
And if you saw just one signal of that, it's probably not that interesting.

249
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,700
All right, but when you start seeing, whoa.

250
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,000
Okay.

251
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,800
There are 7 people researching this a lot and that's three times the amount of activity last week.

252
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:32,700
Now sudden you like maybe something's happening, you know, and I want to kind of focus a little bit more time and attention there and so you get kind of two kinds of intent data.

253
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,200
You get kind of just Baseline levels.

254
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:42,900
These accounts are generally reading about these topics and then you get these surges like wow there's a lot more going on.

255
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,800
Something I might want to pay attention to something demand-based.

256
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,000
We get our intent data by mining, the advertising, Midstream.

257
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,500
So we basically are seeing everywhere.

258
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,700
Web page that has a display out of it, you know?

259
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:06,900
So, every article, every news publication, you know, all that kind of stuff, other content providers like G2, or trust radius, their mining, their own review sites.

260
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:15,100
And so we all get intent data using the same basic algorithm, but by mining different data streams.

261
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:16,700
Yeah.

262
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,900
Hopefully that answered your question very helpful.

263
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,700
Yes, thank you.

264
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Yeah, I think Jose another option to depending on where you are in your journey with this is having a centralized document to that looks at, you know your ICP and it could be different types of icps and kind of laying out a matrix of sorts of your SEO and the keywords that you're targeting based on a tent based on the customer journey.

265
00:28:42,600 --> 00:29:07,000
And then also layering right next to it Nea be IM strategies that compliment where that person is in that strategy and ideally, with that Matrix, you will be able to look at your SEO and ABM strategies and find complementary areas for your SEO to do some of the dredging that we talked about earlier in the call and your ABM to really get in there and start spearfishing to capitalize on the intent.

266
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:20,100
When folks actually hit your area, the pond, You know, I have a lot of opinions and a very love-hate relationship with keywords.

267
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,800
I think that they are an excellent start and can take you very far.

268
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:29,500
I also think that if we can take our keywords one step further, we go to be a lot.

269
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,600
We can I think that's what's needed to compete in SEO, and to get heat in SEO today.

270
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,200
A modern SEO versus traditional, kind of throw on the wall SEO.

271
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,400
It will throw spaghetti on the wall.

272
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,400
See What sticks, you know, publish 100 blogs, maybe one of them, kind of ranks.

273
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,500
The rest of them, don't you actually just lost a lot of money and are not ordinary engineer.

274
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,100
Any traffic to show for it?

275
00:29:51,900 --> 00:30:05,000
We use this, we use a model and methodology to hone in, on the user need, which is the, the exact need and exactly how by John described it where, what is the need of page meets?

276
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,300
Not just a keyword but also the need that paid me to.

277
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,600
My, my comparing Solutions am I learning about High level of the solution.

278
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,100
Am I comparing this solution versus another solution category?

279
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:22,000
I am asking specific questions about that solution and so that's we call the user need, which can be of a more specific intent.

280
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,500
Try to we're building software, you tried a lot of NLP.

281
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Algorithms can't find a tool that automates that yet.

282
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,300
It's human.

283
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:39,400
Editors human marketers that are deciphering user need and but once you know, the user need and the SEO world, you know, exactly who's waiting for that need.

284
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,700
It's usually three to five pages.

285
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,000
Has.

286
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:48,500
And then from an SEO standpoint, beating them isn't is not creating just another page with a keyword on it.

287
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,500
But actually a page that is does as good as these guys.

288
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,300
And even better than meeting that need.

289
00:30:54,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Because there're thousands of pages that have met that need and you have to be the very best, you know, because Google is going to see that the people engage with that page even more than the others you have to be better than.

290
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:12,900
And it's just a far cry from traditional approach to SEO that, you know, I would be published a lot of blogs, but the keyword in it, Open pray and you know, you end up losing money.

291
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,200
So if you can transform and align your content strategy is so concentrated.

292
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,100
Use your needs.

293
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,000
You know what pages?

294
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,300
You need or Pages you have that, you need to increase and you can map your intent data to those user needs as well.

295
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:39,100
So that when people are on search with that intent, they're getting, they're getting you as the goal and Jose, you probably know, you know, we're going to be could talk all day long about user needs.

296
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,000
But when, you know, those user needs and can Catalog them and prioritize them.

297
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:53,600
That's the foundation to then winning that traffic and SEO actually winning and then incredibly competitive, you know, world or landscape of search results today.

298
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,800
Such good points.

299
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,300
Wow.

300
00:31:59,400 --> 00:31:59,700
Okay.

301
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,100
My wheels are turning right now, and I am just thinking even about what you just said made about you.

302
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,200
Each of you mentioned user needs.

303
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Is there a good number of needs that we should be identifying?

304
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:32,600
Or is it just based on like okay this is really spiking John like you said, and should we map those needs out then according to each part of the funnel How do you recommend to strategically hone in, as you said on those user needs across each stage?

305
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,100
I would argue that is the sort of most fundamental strategy.

306
00:32:37,100 --> 00:33:02,400
Well, there's two, what are the top two most fundamental strategies behind ABM, you know is understanding where each account isn't as journey and then customizing you know segmenting and customizing your message accordingly you know and therefore Knowing, you know, that an account that you might be interested in, but is not even aware of the pain, right?

307
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,000
That you need to message that company.

308
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,200
Very, very differently from one that's spiking intent for your category.

309
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:21,800
So that's the first core fundamental as the other one is you can't focus your resources equally on the every account so you should know really prioritize interior accounts to put more resources on the more valuable accounts.

310
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,900
Those two things are probably a VM in a nutshell.

311
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,200
Yeah.

312
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,300
And to borrow the analogy of a BM is that spear, you know again, SEO can play with nicely with that.

313
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:43,300
But it is the net next to it where when anyone has a certain user need if you will when anyone has that need and if you win in the search landscape you're going to capture that.

314
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:53,700
So you want to know as again as I was alluding to earlier when people that are Target account land on your site because I went through that need.

315
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,100
You want to be sure you're a VM team.

316
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,700
Knows that and can respond to that even if they're brand-new visitor to your site there otherwise Anonymous, what do we will identify them?

317
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,300
And potentially, take action, SEO, cast that wide net.

318
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:14,199
If you have a good program that can compete in at the, you know, tightly competitive landscape of search today, and be present for that.

319
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,800
Need your hopefully going to capture anyone that's there all the time, right?

320
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,000
You got your booth in the trade show of search results, right?

321
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,300
And you're at the top and you're the biggest Booth, well, your ABM your target accounts.

322
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,800
They only represent 2% 5%.

323
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:38,600
20% of the people that are doing the search which the searching SEO wants to capture all those that are valuable and convert them to Pipeline and opportunity.

324
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:46,300
ABM you want to be sure that your VM team knows that leads to someone that they can should throw a spear at.

325
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,699
I also think the needs are really important way to align your team.

326
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,000
There's intent.

327
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:15,700
There's also the marketing teams, way to harness that intent, but your team's ability to actually action against that intent and use the context of understanding the need fundamentally understanding, the need to match the reaction towards intent is a really important except there's nothing worse than coming into an ABM strategy.

328
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,900
That was so thoughtful.

329
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,600
All men, all of my needs address everything.

330
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:31,400
I needed only to be met with that next human-to-human interaction, that feels so disconnected from the holistic approach, starting all the way from the very beginning until the point that you talk to a person.

331
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:39,800
So don't underestimate how important needs are in need alignment, internally is to create continuity in that customer Journey from dark funnel.

332
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,500
All the way to meeting the first real life human at your organization.

333
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,500
That's huge.

334
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,700
All these points.

335
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,400
Thank Q.

336
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:58,400
When talking about that alignment, how do you see that actually happening across teams just tactically week-to-week like, how, how does that happen?

337
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,900
Meet just to clarify your question a little bit.

338
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,500
Like, how do you align your teams around needs and your ideal customers needs?

339
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:14,900
And making sure we don't, we don't miss, you know, to your point like making sure we don't miss those opportunities.

340
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,900
Yeah, I mean Tales always time it's marketing and being able to align your team's.

341
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,800
That's one of the most foundational things.

342
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:43,100
I think when it comes to a VM or ABX holistically understanding how to really get your team communicating effectively with one another around those needs and understanding their role in shepherding, someone through they need diagnostic problem of the self-diagnostic problem.

343
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,000
I think it's really important, secondary.

344
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,900
Really, I think also too, just it's cannot be understated.

345
00:36:49,900 --> 00:37:01,100
How important documenting the needs are and then documenting every person's role and responsibilities around those needs, are we talked a lot about documenting, SEO ABM?

346
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:06,900
But if you're not sharing those resources, if you are not providing that transparency for alignment around those needs.

347
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:16,100
It's hard for other folks to know how to get involved with the skill sets that are in their repertoire to carry that journey and make that customers experience a seamless and smooth as possible.

348
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:16,400
School.

349
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,100
I think this is, this is huge.

350
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,400
I feel like a lot of the misalignment internally can happen just because of the lack of some of these things.

351
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,800
You're mentioning the lack of documentation, the lack of communicating.

352
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:39,600
And, you know, asynchronously and synchronously aligning from objectives, kpi is all the way through to feedback and optimization.

353
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,300
So I think that's a huge Point.

354
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,200
As a lot of us are probably working remote or hybrid.

355
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,300
So This is, this is good.

356
00:37:50,700 --> 00:38:01,400
You know, one of the questions that I have is around, identifying your perfect buyer Persona and leveraging, both SEO and ABM to do.

357
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:11,700
So, how are you seeing it with your own company and your own Persona is like, how have you seen that honing in process take place?

358
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,900
And what does that look like?

359
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:26,100
I have been lucky to go to worry about ideal account, ideal person ideal account and person.

360
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:36,500
I guess I will tackle the ideal account one first, you know?

361
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,400
So the framework.

362
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,400
I like to use for that is called fire fire1.

363
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:57,000
So the effing fire stands for fit and, you know, this is really if you look at the, just the information about that company, are they a good fit with your other customers?

364
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,800
Their industry, their size, their Station.

365
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:06,100
If you're a technology company turns out, one of the most important factors for fit is what other Technologies do.

366
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:13,800
They already own complementary Technologies, competitive Technologies, one of those Technologies up for Renewal, all those types of good things.

367
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,200
The I stand for intent, which we have talked about, you know, really like where are they?

368
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,500
In their Journey, you know, do they have?

369
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,200
They never heard of this category or they actively research.

370
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,200
The r stands for relationship, you know?

371
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,000
And this is really, you know, do you have contacts in history with this account?

372
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,800
I mean, maybe you.

373
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:38,000
Maybe they just hired somebody who wasn't your customer at a prior company.

374
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,800
You know, maybe you did a close loss deal because they weren't ready to buy six months ago.

375
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:53,200
But now they might be, you know, all that context and relationship and then the he's engagement and this is really representing.

376
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,500
Are they engaging with you and your company?

377
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,800
Are they coming to Website, are they attending your events, do they open your emails?

378
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,800
You know, that kind of thing.

379
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:22,700
Each of these, I think are interesting ingredients to use when your sort of tried to identify that ideal account because all things, you know, obviously want the good fit, but all things being equal, you know, knowing where they are in their journey and what context and how engaged they are also matters as well.

380
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,900
So I will take that on the company one and leave.

381
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,200
The person one may be for others.

382
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,300
That acronym is really strong.

383
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,700
So that's fire stands for fit.

384
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,800
Intent, relationship and engagement correct.

385
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,600
Thank you.

386
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,800
You do on the ABM side, running our own programs.

387
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,300
I only have two small items to throw into that.

388
00:40:48,300 --> 00:41:12,500
Number one is if there are any defacto and I will say automatable if you're trying to scale an ABM program and there're certain aspects of a company's technos technology stack that can be that is existed in your CRM and you can process hundreds or even thousands accounts just to churn out the probable.

389
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,200
That's before you do a manual review.

390
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,800
It's incredibly powerful.

391
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:29,500
So always look to automate as much depth Z as many steps as you can to get down to the right fit accounts and then and frankly leave room for even two for higher scale, ABM programs.

392
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:35,800
You're trying to reach many hundreds, even thousands of accounts leave room for reasonable room for human review.

393
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Don't just grab a proposed list.

394
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,500
That's a team member found, and we're excited about our first.

395
00:41:42,600 --> 00:42:03,300
I am at it but allow yourself and engage and encourage your team to spend time in human review and to those doubts concerns or what about that come up, it's far easier to Target the right accounts and even a smaller list of the right accounts, then a bigger list of mixed accounts.

396
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,900
That's great.

397
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,800
Thank you MK.

398
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:16,100
Did you have anything there about the buyer in particular narrowing in?

399
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,800
Yeah, I am plus ones and Nate suggestion about getting some folks to partner with you.

400
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:32,300
For some real time, testing the Persona that you're using on top of the company fit for your business, I would be remiss if I didn't say that, that fire acronym was fire.

401
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:38,700
John's, I appreciate you sharing that with us, but there is something to be said about some of the feedback loop that you get.

402
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,200
Partnering with your business development teams, if your team has won, I have been lucky.

403
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:51,700
I have worked with a couple of different companies that have been at different stages of implementing a VM, and complementary to their SEO.

404
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:04,800
And some of the need suggestions about great creating smaller list and testing against Persona types of testing, the needs framework testing your messaging framework against certain job types.

405
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:12,900
And job titles has been a really fast feedback loop from marketing to In up additional testing for ebm strategies as well.

406
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Thanks MK.

407
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:28,200
I am going to jump to this question on SEO analytics and how that can provide insights to the ABM campaigns.

408
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,500
As they're progressing, Nate I am going to hand it over to you sure.

409
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:46,800
You know, I think the reality and forgive me for repeating myself, but the reality of the competitive nature of SEO today, modern SEO is about competing with Was it ends, right?

410
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,200
You're trying to win the gold medal.

411
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,400
You're not just trying to go down to the local gym and swim for some exercise.

412
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,400
Like and if that's how you treat SEO, like I am just going down to the gym couple times a week.

413
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:07,700
The reality is that you win and you learn traffic, your SEO campaign delivers Roi when you win the gold medal or the silver or the bronze.

414
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,200
That doesn't mean it's impossible.

415
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:16,000
It means do the right things and really see who's winning and figure out how I can strategically beat them.

416
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,000
And it's very doable and it's a scalable approach.

417
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:25,300
And if you're doing that and you're getting traffic, I think you want to understand what traffic.

418
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,600
What are the what portion that traffic are inside of your target accounts?

419
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,200
What portion that traffic are part of your target account?

420
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:34,700
Set?

421
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:42,000
What portion are not, I consider it successful, no matter how much traffic were getting.

422
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,000
If we're moving the needle, I am tired accounts and pipeline generated.

423
00:44:47,000 --> 00:45:00,500
I think the biggest mistake that's made in a SEO campaign that begins to take off is some level of leadership will say, you know, only 5% or 1% of this traffic converts.

424
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,300
Well, let us not look at direct conversion.

425
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:09,100
Let us look at Revenue attribution and broader metrics with a water time scale.

426
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,800
Regardless, the question isn't.

427
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,900
Just, what percent of traffic, converts, what's the ROI on the traffic?

428
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:21,200
How much is attributing to Pipeline and impacting pipeline directly or indirectly?

429
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,200
And if we're seeing a good impact on Pipeline SEO is a wide net.

430
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,500
You're going to see a lot of traffic.

431
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,100
You're going to see a lot of students researching.

432
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,100
You're going to see, maybe there are nonprofits, that's not a Target account.

433
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,200
Just companies that aren't a Target account.

434
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:41,300
You're going to see a lot of trap people with that need only a small percentage of might be those that are Target account.

435
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:46,800
So the question is in what percent is really driving in a VM programmer, Having leads.

436
00:45:46,800 --> 00:46:00,600
But rather how much revenue or pipeline can we find that since that's measuredly associated with RSU initiatives and the co-worker That's huge distinction?

437
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,000
Thanks name.

438
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:12,500
We are sorry, if we in our customers generally, find that it's pretty useful to look at all your web analytics with that kind of account overlay.

439
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,300
On top of it, it's kind of what Nate's needs getting at, you know, you know.

440
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,600
So it's not just, hey, what am I traffic sources?

441
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,200
But you know what?

442
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,800
Am I traffic sources for the Target accounts?

443
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,100
You know what?

444
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,200
Not, just what page is convert the best.

445
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:45,800
What pages, convert the best for the Target accounts and to do all that you obviously need to build a connect, your DNA on immunization to your Analytics, And if I may just because it's free, I don't mind promoting a little bit.

446
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:53,900
Demand-based does have something called account ID, free where any company can just go and install our tag on your site and connect it to your Google analytics.

447
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:54,900
And we will do this for you.

448
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,800
Oh sweet.

449
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,500
So just you can search, you know, account ID free on our site and get it.

450
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:03,700
Good to know.

451
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,100
Awesome.

452
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,000
Alright, so here's another more tactical question.

453
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:17,500
How do you leverage SEO and ABM to build clean retargeting audiences?

454
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,800
Anyone else want to go first?

455
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,600
I do know that you're done, we want to learn from you.

456
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,400
Yeah, I think you have got the most to say John, but I do know that SEO.

457
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,200
Can, if you're getting a lots of high-value non-branded SEO.

458
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,800
Traffic retargeting is a must for sure.

459
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:49,400
Retargeting is generally how you drive the most conversion possible from the visitors that came to you from SEO in total.

460
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:59,700
Its I would call it a must But yeah I know John what were your thoughts the way I like to think about it.

461
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:10,100
You know is if you're only retargeting the target accounts then you're going to minimize your wasted money.

462
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:30,300
You know, typically, you know if you're just doing a regular retargeting campaign, you know, you very well may be retargeting that student or that you know, who was never going to be a customer, but when you take that account ID lens to it and say, all right well these are the companies that I can actually sell to.

463
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:37,900
They're the ones getting retargeting, you know, typically I think you're going to get better results and this matters.

464
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,100
I mean we did a study across.

465
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,300
Every company of ours that has our tag on the site.

466
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:56,800
So, all of our paid and free customers and across that whole universe, only 37 percent of the traffic coming from search to company sites.

467
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,800
We're we even able to identify it as coming from a business.

468
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,100
Let alone a Target account, you know?

469
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:11,300
And so there is, I think a fair amount of waste on this but, you know, it's even broader.

470
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,600
I think you goes back to that Journey.

471
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:23,100
You know where you have got that qualified account, you know, which is not even like be what you're interested in them, but they don't even know.

472
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:32,700
There's a problem, you know, and you know, you should know how do you reach out to them using something like display advertising, but it's not retargeting.

473
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,800
It's account focused advertising distant, try to build some awareness of the problem and Trust in your brand.

474
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,300
Then if they start showing some intent, now, you want to kind of catch their attention.

475
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,900
Tension to bring them to you.

476
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,200
And you thought leadership can work really well.

477
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,600
And now once you have got them to your site, that's when the retargeting can kick in, you know?

478
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,800
So I also like a theme.

479
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,100
We have had this whole, this whole conversation.

480
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,100
It's a line into the journey as well, hmm.

481
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,800
So good inside as well.

482
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:16,300
Bridging, the Divide between our last question and this question and making sure we're going really far down the funnel to understand where were generating revenue.

483
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,300
And also how we're generating Revenue that is not only retained the potentially expands.

484
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,500
I think that becomes a really interesting lens to layer on top of your retargeting efforts.

485
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:34,000
And it can't be understated to how important it is a knowing, how your business, like, what your business is and how it converts.

486
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:44,900
Just About this free traffic tracking tool as a great lead generation strategy of freemium strategy, product LED growth strategies.

487
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:57,000
Those strategies do need to be laid over top your retargeting strategy, to make sure you are not wasting the efficiencies, in your spend, you're gaining efficiencies and you're spending your retargeting campaigns as well.

488
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:04,100
Efficiency is the key for this year to name of the game.

489
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:08,300
So that's these are really insightful points.

490
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,300
Thank you so much for sharing.

491
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:19,800
So let us say we identify and narrow in on those that are Target's, even in the, in the retargeting.

492
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,200
How do we drive the engagement up?

493
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:29,000
John, you mentioned a few things about thought leadership and different things, you know, across that entire funnel MK.

494
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,700
I am gonna throw this one out.

495
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:38,800
Do you like what are some things that we can do to really double down on the engagement with high intent buyers?

496
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:45,200
And at what point should we be pulling those levers and tripling down?

497
00:51:47,500 --> 00:52:04,000
Yeah I mean I would be remiss if I didn't talk about gifting somewhere in the answer of boosting engagement with your high, in 10, high value accounts, but I will copy it that by saying that Gifting just by sending someone to give cars by throwing something like that.

498
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,900
To someone to try to get them to convert, or spend time with you is actually winning in efficacy.

499
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:20,900
So making sure that the tactic that you're using to boost engagement matches the authenticity of the need of the moment and of the audience that you are targeting.

500
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:29,600
I think there's a lot of really fun and interesting ways to engage with folks and capitalizing on their need first.

501
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:38,100
And I am working outwards is a really valuable way to examine your options and the exploration of Engagement with folks.

502
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:44,800
For example, if their need is I need to see more Intel on who's coming to my website.

503
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,700
Then creating an amazing free tool.

504
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:54,400
Like demand base has is an awesome way to engage with your community creating a webinar.

505
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,700
Like this to help folks, who are maybe just starting off with SEO and a VM and trying to find complementary.

506
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,300
Geez to boost efficiency.

507
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:05,900
He's there in, is a really great way to engage with folks.

508
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:22,400
The rule of thumb that I advise folks out on finding the right engagement tactic is to understand what's going to help someone authentically connect with your brand and learn about your domain, expertise, through that experience.

509
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:32,800
And when you layer that lens on top of the engagement tactics that you have available to you, you start ruling out things that feel a little Official, you start ruling out some of those engagement tactics.

510
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:41,000
That feels a diamond doesn't from everybody else's playbooks and ABF, but I will say coming all the way full circle back to gifting.

511
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,500
I do think gifting has a vital role to play in account-based execution and I love seeing it.

512
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,700
Be used as mid-cycle accelerators.

513
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:58,200
I love it, being the relationship accelerant in a sales cycle, it's not the best door opener.

514
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,800
I think it's like I said, waiting and See there but it's a great way to show.

515
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,000
Hey I am a real human.

516
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:11,700
I know you're a real human and it's a really fun time and a place for us to partner to help one another in are mutually shared objectives moving forward.

517
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,900
So that's really interesting that you're saying that it's not best.

518
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:25,300
Maybe be leveraged at the very top of the funnel that like, hey, get a free gift, you know, you don't know me.

519
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:36,200
Well, but yeah, you don't know that Brian gifting is really kind of Channel fundamentally above it all, but it also, there's a quid pro quo kind of nature to it, right?

520
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:52,800
Like you are going to give someone a gift card to get something in return and so that ruse, I think it like I said, is not working as well, for some folks who know that on the other side of getting five dollars to Starbucks, are going to have to sit and have someone go through the pinch of sorts.

521
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:59,900
And it does the lost the intent of a gift is just completely with lost in the meaning of that exchange with someone one.

522
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:06,500
So post-relationship being established is where, yeah, you recommend.

523
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:19,800
That's my Pro tip for folks who are thinking about incorporating getting into their avian strategy and don't forget, your customers are also great, great marketers for your business too.

524
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,900
So post-sales celebrate celebrations, through gifting is also great to account-based.

525
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,700
Marketing doesn't stop at the first point of sale.

526
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,400
That's a big one.

527
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,900
That's a whole other webinar right there.

528
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Yeah, for sale might have to invite you guys up for that conversation, as we have got four minutes left.

529
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:48,900
So this has been an incredibly Rich conversation, you have taken us way, 300,000 stretch, strategic level thinking very tactical to the ground.

530
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,400
I really appreciate it.

531
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,900

Chase and we are super excited to be able to have her here.

6
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:03,300
As she is going to crack the code for us on these myths around marketing attribution and metrics.

7
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,900
I mean, there's a lot of things that you see on LinkedIn and different influencers.

8
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,800
In out different things we were just talking about this in the green room and majority of it is probably pretty fluffy.

9
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,300
So I am excited to bring up Julia, join me here on stage.

10
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,400
Alright.

11
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,100
Hello.

12
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,400
Hi.

13
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,900
How's it going?

14
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,700
How are you?

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,900
Thank you for having me.

18
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,200
Oh, I am excited because you have got a lot to say about marketing metrics.

19
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:46,300
Attributions, you're probably one of the savviest markers, experienced marketers, and, and you can go really deep.

20
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:54,200
I have found with attribution metrics, and so before we jump in the key, tell us a little bit just about you and cap.

21
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,800
Chase.

22
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,300
Yeah, so I am Julia.

23
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,000
I am the VP of marketing at cap.

24
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,200
Chase I live in New York and Brooklyn which is almost Manhattan.

25
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:14,600
She's getting some really I spent my time prior to being intact really traveling the world and spending a lot of time living in a lot of countries.

26
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:33,600
I lived in Madrid Vancouver, even Las Vegas at one point and that's primarily because my husband was a professional poker player before he pivoted into Tech and I Yeah, I am I live I ran a link Farm originally, I was like deep and a CR at one point in my career, a link Farm.

27
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:45,900
I had a disgusting link Farm, but one point you could hack anything, it was like, Hey, like, we want to rank and it was like, scrape, your content blink, an s*** out of it and have the right domain name and remain power.

28
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,000
It's hard to imagine this.

29
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:56,500
Now, I feel like saying this makes me sound really old, but I was like, if you wanted to appear for, let us say Vancouver, if you bought the keyword, like travel Hoover or the domain.

30
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,700
Sorry Travel Vancouver or like go Vancouver you would be number one.

31
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:17,000
Like it was just that easy obviously with like all that shifted but I think that taught me a thing or two about like not looking at everything as if there's like some Trend that's going to solve your problems and probably why I go so deep on everything because like I did do that and it was cool while it lasted.

32
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,900
I made some money off it but That doesn't mean it's sad when it dies, let me tell you.

33
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:31,500
So a little bit about cap Chase and, you know, I am probably the most excited about this company at any company, I have been at purely off of the traction.

34
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,300
They have had in two years and how different and disruptive they really are in the industry.

35
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:45,300
And so when I started looking for my next job and like where I wanted to land, it was really important to me that they were a B2B company for supervisors.

36
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,800
I don't do b2c marketing, I don't even want to talk about it.

37
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,600
I don't get it.

38
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:55,200
I just told a girl my team that's social is the thing that like I just don't understand and like great job, and she was like, okay?

39
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,100
And then I really researched a lot and I have been at a lot of startups.

40
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,800
I have been at SAS companies, I have done the, you know, I lived in San Francisco.

41
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,800
I did the Silicon Valley, like quintessential thing.

42
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:15,400
And what I have seen is I could there're big raises, followed, big layoffs, followed by, you know, success or non-success.

43
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:25,600
And a lot of times the internals of the company don't actually match the Any of what the valuations say or like, raising is also telling a story.

44
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:33,200
And, so I was looking for someone who was doing something really different, that was kind of taking away from that, could provide value to people without giving up equity.

45
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,900
And I kind of came across cap, Chase organically, and actually applied for the job, without a recruiter, which kind of rare in my position, I think.

46
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:49,000
Anyway, so if you haven't heard of capture a Serafin tech company that helps a Saunders get money and essentially how they do.

47
00:08:49,100 --> 00:09:02,200
That are they look at your recurring Revenue, we have really Advanced Integrations with pretty much every major way that you would record Banking, and then they're able to assess and unlock funds almost instantly.

48
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,000
And so unlike in a traditional baked word takes months, we can do it in.

49
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,300
I mean, depends on the client but like two three days.

50
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,200
I am and like Max a week so really fast.

51
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,600
And it was incredibly important for me to be at a company that I felt had product Market fit.

52
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,100
You know, a lot of people say they have it.

53
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:30,500
That's I can talk about this but like the number one myth is like if you don't have a product you can't really Market anything everything dies.

54
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,200
So I was really excited, they have raised over 900 million dollars and worked with over 3,000.

55
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,100
Where's at this point, and they're only two years old, and they're in your lap Mark already.

56
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,200
So really exciting company, really disrupting a really fun place to be.

57
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,900
And yeah, that was kind of what I was looking for.

58
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,500
But anyway, let us jump into Market ngratulations marketing.

59
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,000
Know, it's really cool.

60
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,100
It's a very cool company.

61
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:02,200
I am thrilled to be part of the team and to have been, you know, to have gotten through their interview process and be where I am.

62
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,500
I have learned so much already, and I am really excited about it.

63
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,000
That's awesome.

64
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:16,000
Well, we're so excited to unpack some of these myths and attribution metric myths.

65
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:27,600
So before we jump into that, though we do have a pole, let us pull up the pole and see how many marketing attribution software tools.

66
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,600
Are you currently using at your company?

67
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,800
So, feel free to place your votes in there.

68
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,900
I have got up to 10 options here.

69
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,800
I mean, I feel like people use a lot.

70
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,600
I am always getting out of yeah, 426, I am always getting sent them.

71
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
My people in the company are like, hey, we need to buy this.

72
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
I am like, do we?

73
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,300
This is going to be a big topic that you're going to help us unpack.

74
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,300
All right, well, that's good to know it.

75
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,800
So most.

76
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,600
Whoa, here we go.

77
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,100
Okay, four to six.

78
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,400
Is the common doesn't surprise me schools.

79
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,500
All right.

80
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay.

81
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:34,200
Well that gives us a good sense of how many folks are using tools and I guess the question really is like relying on as we're jumping into this topic here you know, you think about B2B marketing there, it's a complex buying process and even harder going into 2023 with layoffs less resources.

82
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:46,400
You gotta Sokak LTV profitability across everything, everyone's tighter more than ever, the board of directors investors everybody is like on you more than ever.

83
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:58,000
And so this is where Julia like you are the expert here with all the experience you had and I love the transparency, you had transparency.

84
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,200
You had with me when we spoke earlier of just like the numbers of failures that have helped.

85
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,000
You get to this point of Learning.

86
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:14,300
And so, I mean, I would love to just hear your thoughts of just like going in and 2023.

87
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:22,800
What are you saying with some of the big shifts and changes and with marketing attribution and metrics?

88
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,900
You know, is there anything that you're seeing in particular that's really changing or different?

89
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:41,200
Yeah, I mean, I think a lot has shifted in marketing first of all like I think like the era of doing nothing, I am not doing nothing like the pray and spray, it's like coming to an ear and you just can't afford to do it, right?

90
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:51,600
Like it's just too expensive and so that kind of like has brought I would say the emergence of line of thinking that you see everywhere, you know.

91
00:12:51,600 --> 00:13:00,100
Like I think B2B it goes through like four years, like originally was the demand generation experts like, that was like Thing you needed to do.

92
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,600
You need to do DG and like that solves your problems and then it was like, you need to do a BM that solves your problems.

93
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,100
And now I kind of think we're moving into like this like oh it's a I was like AI is going to solve all your problems.

94
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:21,400
Like we're going to run an i and like AI has gotten really good on some things and like I still, you know, I am using tools like I don't use chat GTA, but I use Jasper, which is a competitor of theirs.

95
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:27,000
And I had to write a lot of stuff and I think that it's an amazing.

96
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,100
What you can do with II and attack.

97
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:46,000
And but I also think that if you are unable to understand what you're trying to get out of something, if you are unable to connect, you know, everything to the core and the foundation's like, it doesn't really matter because I chat GPT can't tell you what it's going to say.

98
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,200
Like you still have to tell it what you want it to say.

99
00:13:48,200 --> 00:14:09,900
It just writes the content without you having to go through like the first iteration of you know I don't even know what you want to say like the first iteration of R draft or you have like think through how you're going to intro like it kind of does that work for you but like you still need to know the story or telling you still need to know that the data points and like your narrative around it or it's that's right.

100
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,500
It's generic fluff.

101
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:28,400
So yeah and I think like one of the things I have seen is like when I came in to be like I started in growth, and I was running a free product and I think like also by the way, like Worlds, Collide in Silicon Valley, like that company is very much come back into my life, like in a million ways.

102
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:35,900
And I was like, really But anyways, that product I worked on a free product building, a free product.

103
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,700
And like, just like all tech companies, I kind of like threw a sketch.

104
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Violet me, that was like pre figma, and they were like, hey here you build it?

105
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
I was like, I don't, I don't.

106
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,200
Yeah.

107
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,500
And I like deleted stuff.

108
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,000
I was like, all right, here's your free product and that was like the era of the growth marketer.

109
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,900
And I was like, all right, we're going to make a free product and it's to drive referrals, and we're going to be viral, and we're going to be just like Dropbox and like that's the goal and I think we did do a lot of that.

110
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,600
At and it did become the demand generation machine for the company, and I am really proud of that.

111
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:24,500
But what I saw in like what has enlightened, I think the way I approach marketing forever, as first of all, I had a really hard CEO in that he was like a very, not hard as a person, but he was a very He needed like in a good way like I think he pushed people that I probably wouldn't have pushed myself.

112
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:32,000
And, so I was forced to make models and do things that was like, way outside of my comfort zone is like an early entry was basically growth marketer.

113
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,600
I was just like, what, what do you mean a growth model?

114
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
What the hell is that?

115
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:49,800
And I did all that with his help and that really paves the way for me, I think in my career, and he also really he gave us again like these errors are gone but now you have run Cards and a different credit card system.

116
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,000
But back then there were like these Embers cards and was like almost like a gift card.

117
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,400
And every day, I would have to be like, hey we're out of her LinkedIn.

118
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,200
Budget, can I like have some money please?

119
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,100
And I am both cars.

120
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:10,300
Will get like shut down and so, you know, my mentality walking into tooling and anything is like, will the first place of financial department is going to go or CEOs going to go with the marketing team.

121
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,700
Like they don't attack Engineers on their toolset, they don't attack product teams on all the tools, they're using.

122
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,200
But they're going to come after the marketing.

123
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:17,400
Team.

124
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,600
They really don't even go up to the sales team, they're going to come after the marketing team and be like, hey the f*** are you spending money on?

125
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,500
And so, I am very Roi focus and I think like the new world is like Revenue.

126
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,800
I have heard that I have seen this all over the internet but like, I really believe in Revenue based marketing.

127
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,400
And to me, that's like you just drive all the way through the funnel.

128
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Like, you're not really just a lead generation machine.

129
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:46,500
You're focused on like finding the right people doing it, efficiently and yeah, that's kind of like my Spiel and B2B but beauty is hard.

130
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:58,300
I wasn't into Like it's a Playbook but it's not a Playbook and I called a bread or earlier Revenue based marketing.

131
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,600
Can you like give us a little definition of that?

132
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,599
I mean, I kind of made it up but I see it everywhere.

133
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:12,599
So I am sure there's like a real definition and like one of the things that drives me nuts is when people use a word that's like actually has a meaning and like you make up your own meaning to it.

134
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,700
So like I might be doing that right now so just like all good.

135
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,099
Eric what's your showed you?

136
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:25,300
Yeah, to me, Revenue base marketing is basically if you look and I think this is what's so interesting is you see this everywhere.

137
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:41,300
It's like the type of algorithm you see, on LinkedIn words like go all the way to revenue and your Roi should be 3x, whatever your cost is and like all of these like really crazy budgetary, like, considerations for how you should do your CAC and all of that sort of stuff.

138
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,100
But I don't think about it.

139
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,500
Like that.

140
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,200
I would say, like, when I think of Revenue based marketing, it's like, literally my team.

141
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,200
When we look at our dashboard, Words, we don't actually look at cost and mql.

142
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,900
We look all the way across to revenue.

143
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,100
It's in the dash.

144
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:59,700
It's how I guide my agency, and I am not telling them drive me mql like I don't actually care.

145
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:11,000
I barely look at that number and like I am sure everyone is appalled by that but I look at you know what you would consider like a qualified sales qualified lead is usually where I stop.

146
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:26,400
I mean I will look all the way through but obviously B2B sales Cycles tend to be a little longer so you need like a more don't feedback loop and so like I am judging on Revenue at that point in then I use like the prehistoric like conversion rates from sales to figure out exactly what a reasonable rate for that is.

147
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:39,700
And then I Hold Steady on that and that can mean a lot of things, it means if that goes up at a point where I am uncomfortable, I am going to cut spend, like I am not going to keep spending which is I think very different from what most people do at least from what I have seen.

148
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,400
Most people just keep spending and I like it will come back down but it's a math problem, right?

149
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,100
Like if your denominator just keeps going up, like you're f*****.

150
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,100
I cut spend it.

151
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,000
I make them every one re-optimize within the campaign's you have.

152
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:04,800
And that means that like you can grow really efficiently at that point because I very optimized and you're not like bloated with a lot of add keywords, or whatever if you're doing vlad's or whatever particular tool you're in.

153
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,500
And so I think about that with everything though.

154
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:17,000
So I look at you know I ran an outbound team and an inbound team and to me like all that mattered was your Roi on each of those humans because basically there are tool, right?

155
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,200
Like You're paying for them.

156
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,900
And, so I think about all marketing channels, like that organic same thing.

157
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,300
Like, how much does it cost to create content?

158
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, okay, there's like your costume to organic and I break it out like that and then I try very hard to like focus on the.

159
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,400
I mean, it sounds so obvious.

160
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:44,700
Everyone says this, but like I literally do this like just focus on the one thing that's working and to try to add their instead of like trying to do everything at once and that means slower growth in a lot of ways.

161
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:52,700
But like I do think right now in the current environment You're not going to triple like you're going to double, like it's going to be really hard.

162
00:19:52,700 --> 00:20:03,500
And I think with boards breathing down people's necks like you don't want to be spending making those assumptions until you're really secure with that level of spend.

163
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,900
Because at the end of the day it's my job on the line, right?

164
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,000
Like whom are they going to yell at?

165
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,400
It's me, right?

166
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,300
Right?

167
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
What are they trying to be really conservative?

168
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,100
What are the current channels going into 2023 that you guys are focused on?

169
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,700
On and then doubling down on.

170
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:30,300
I mean, people would probably, like, judge me, this is another thing like, you know, we're talking about the myths and attribution and modeling like the belief that there is somehow some magic be to be like sauce.

171
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,200
And Instagram is kind of lost on me.

172
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Like, I just, I don't think that Facebook is going to.

173
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,800
I know you can do really good look-alikes, and you can do all sorts of things.

174
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:54,100
But like unless you're targeting a person who is on Instagram all day, like I guess more tech people, like, I am on Instagram a lot but like I am going after Different Persona and like, I don't think they're sitting there all day, and so I don't think it's an efficient use of capital.

175
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,100
I still think Google will reign supreme.

176
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,000
I think that it's the best, like, it's the highest intent traffic.

177
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,500
You can pull in, and I think you can inform a lot off of what Google keywords are performing.

178
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,900
Like you can build SEO programs, you can build a million things.

179
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,200
And I think that LinkedIn, you know, for a B2B for not everyone, you know, I have done this for different personas, like it doesn't always work but If LinkedIn is performing for you, it's very expensive, but it tends.

180
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,600
It has some really good targeting.

181
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:29,400
And in some ways I think LinkedIn, you know, I have an agency now that runs this, but they said this to me and I thought this was like, I trust them.

182
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:47,000
That the LinkedIn is almost at a point where you can do true, ABM on it like you don't really need to buy an additional software to do that and that's what I mean about like be careful about your marriage sex doc you know the era of like just by everything by an intent based software right before you get into that.

183
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,900
Let us jump into myth number one.

184
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,500
Let us go to the first one.

185
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,900
What is your first myth?

186
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,800
You need more Tech tools.

187
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,600
I don't think so.

188
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,100
I mean, I guess you didn't pack them.

189
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,100
You need some more Tech tools.

190
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,700
Do you need something to send emails?

191
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,200
That's a good system.

192
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,400
That campaign stamps.

193
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,100
Yes.

194
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,400
So you need like Marketo or HubSpot.

195
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,600
Thank you.

196
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,400
Not going to live without that marketing automation is core.

197
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,500
You need to do lead scoring.

198
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Do you need much else?

199
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,800
I don't know, maybe segment.

200
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,700
Even if your product team isn't running out, like that's something you need.

201
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:33,100
You need to see a mess, otherwise you're slow and clunky and by the way, talk about Lessons Learned, you know, I am notorious, I will never forget this.

202
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:39,000
I have told to companies that if you didn't code your own f****** website, you are in a tech company, not true.

203
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,200
Oops.

204
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:51,100
But the that you need to CMS and I think that's really the core of what you need to do your job.

205
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,600
Job.

206
00:22:51,600 --> 00:23:01,100
And then you need to be able to take that data at from segments and you need an analyst who can build you some sort of bi tool which the company probably needs anyway.

207
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:17,700
So it's not really a marketing purchase but I think with those things you can do just about anything you need some data tools, if you're going to pull list and things like that and you need, you know, the B2B toolset of like some sort of CMS but I see it's ERM sorry.

208
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:39,800
But other than that, like Think you can do a lot and, you know if you're starting out like I think it depends on the era of the company to like, I have gotten some tools, I love an example of show pad, that was really expensive and spent a lot of money on it, but it depends on the needs of the business and I think that made sense for us.

209
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,700
But like I am not I can't buy show ped today at the company.

210
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,300
I am at they don't need and it's expensive.

211
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:54,400
So that's not a marketing attribution tool, but I think just that's one thing I think just if you look at even the Our Tech stack is like you need visible and you need this thing and you need that thing.

212
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:06,300
And you know, you know, some sort of Demands software, you need something to send gifts, you need like Lord, only knows like there's just a million tools and I don't think you do.

213
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,700
And I actually think like, if your foundations aren't, if your house isn't built, right?

214
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:15,100
Like the more you add the worse, it gets because that's why your attribution is f*****.

215
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,500
Like just bottom-line.

216
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:24,200
Like you cannot, you cannot look it attribution and think like, oh, hey like Our inputs equals better like that's not actually true.

217
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:31,500
If you can't understand the simple stuff, like adding more to it just makes it like data soup and soup, you end up.

218
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,800
It is Data soup.

219
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,100
And then it's like the UTM.

220
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,800
Have you ever seen?

221
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,600
Like the, I have done this so many times.

222
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:56,100
Now that like, it almost, it's almost comical to me, like, I have yet to join a company that could do utm's properly like the UTM Mass is like, I don't know what that is, but like I think I actually think I do know I think like there is a human aspect to all of this, you cannot take the human out of it and like, you know, you don't want a doctor who's been on for 20 hours a week.

223
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,100
You don't really want a marketer being responsible for adding tagging codes like that.

224
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,900
Do you want to pull a?

225
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,600
You want to automate as much of that as possible and remove that?

226
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:13,800
And so, with more Tech tools, you're getting into, like, we need to do multi-touch attribution, and we need to do all these things because we touch them so many times, and we need to like the world is so complicated and often.

227
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:25,900
If you believe that You just swim in your data and I have talked to many CEOs and I have talked to many people where they're unable to tie their conversions to like a source really tie the conversions to a source.

228
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:34,600
So it's like, oh well like you teams are being stripped on the, like, Google oauth page, or like, we don't really know where all these people came from, but like, they're converting.

229
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,200
So like how do we decode that?

230
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,700
And I am like, well, I just don't trust my marketing team.

231
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:55,500
I hear that a lot, and I am like, well, If that's the case, like, why are you letting them by more s*** like stop buying s*** like and start over a little bit, like, revisit the core of, like, what, you know, how these things are built.

232
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,200
And I think, like, if you can build and I almost, it's I it's funny.

233
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,300
I hope none of the people that have worked for me.

234
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,700
You're going to hear this, but I hated marketing Ops.

235
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
I have inherited it a lot.

236
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,400
It's like very complicated and important actually.

237
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,400
And they I actually think like don't buy tools like get your marketing Ops in order, like Get the Lead scoring working.

238
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:23,400
Spend the time, making sure your status is makes sense, that you can pull the reports you need.

239
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:35,800
And I think, like, often, you know what, you see on LinkedIn is like, you need to do like 50 touch attribution and you need to this tool changed my life.

240
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:44,800
And I don't think that anybody talk about, it is really doing it because if you're really doing it, then you wouldn't need to talk about it.

241
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,400
Like companies this masked ball might drop and I mean, it's kind of true, isn't it?

242
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,100
Like they're looking Its social media.

243
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:09,500
Like it's like the era of YouTube is kind of ending to write and like, how many people bought makeup because they were told to buy it by someone who is paid by a makeup company to do it, you know, like I don't, I don't think that you can that wasn't true reviews.

244
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:16,800
Like mmm, that was marketing and like I think as a marketer you guys people should be a little more Savvy.

245
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,500
Like, you know, you read about how Uber did it or how this company did it.

246
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,400
But if you actually talk to people work at these companies and I do try To do that a lot.

247
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,900
They're just like, oh yeah, it was really messy.

248
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:33,000
It was bad like, okay, makes I think that like, Yeah, The Illusion that someone has it together.

249
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:46,200
I don't know, I think it's always a challenge and if you're dependent on tools, you're actually in a worse position than if you're at least dependent on yourself with the economy being where it is.

250
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,400
Like, you don't want to be hyper dependent on a tool set.

251
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,400
It also means like you're managing tools, right?

252
00:27:53,400 --> 00:28:01,500
Like, that's, that's a lot of work versus Andre, I think with, you know, the actual working on doing marketing, like I bought drift.

253
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,200
I will tell you, I tell everyone that I bought, I was really early to drift.

254
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
They came to our Office.

255
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,800
They like built.

256
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:11,900
It was so early that I remember the amazing guy who like literally like, wrote all the coffee for me and like installed it on our website.

257
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,100
I am sure they don't do that anymore.

258
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,000
And I was so excited.

259
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,300
I literally did the math put them?

260
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,500
I was like, we get this many visitors a month at this conversion rate.

261
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,900
You're going to give me a 2% uptick.

262
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,600
That means that I am going to have this much money more and on my lead funnel every month.

263
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,100
And they were like, yo, it's like magic.

264
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,300
And you know what?

265
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,600
It actually turned into.

266
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
It was a nightmare.

267
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,800
I didn't know how to turn it off.

268
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,200
Off.

269
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,700
It was always on the SDR team disappeared to Burning Man.

270
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,500
And I spent the whole week trying to figure out how to turn drift off because no one could man.

271
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
It did nothing.

272
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,300
And like, I was like, oh lesson learned.

273
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,300
Like if your you made me believe I needed this.

274
00:28:52,300 --> 00:29:00,500
And you did some really good marketing, but like I don't think this does much like I summons, highly motivated to buy your product, do they really need to chat pop up to make them buy it?

275
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,600
Like probably not support.

276
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,800
That makes a lot more sense.

277
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,100
But I don't know about for marketing, like, and like to make matters even more interesting like we had intercom.

278
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,800
And I bought drift on top of that.

279
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,900
Wow, cool.

280
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,300
You had real-life experience lesson learned right there.

281
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,400
Yeah.

282
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,600
I mean, and but that's not an attribution tool but it's the same thing and that adds complexity, right?

283
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:39,300
Because now you're like, if you're looking at attribution and you're looking at the world of where things are coming from, you, suddenly have another chance Well, that isn't capturing your utm's like suddenly they're in a chair pot you're like f***.

284
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,900
Where the hell did these people come from?

285
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,700
I don't know and I think like you really want to streamline that and you want to make it easy for the buyer.

286
00:29:47,700 --> 00:30:00,800
Like you know what do I think is like the most important thing actually for a B2B marketer to buy, it's a calendar booking tool for the most part nobody wants to like when would want to take a break, which one's your favorite?

287
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,900
No, I am going to give props to Chile Piper but I will say that it has its problems.

288
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,800
Mm, I like chili Piper.

289
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,200
I think on a big sales team.

290
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:16,400
They do like really smart routing and but do I think for most teams you could probably get away with like the built-in HubSpot one?

291
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:16,800
Yeah.

292
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:24,700
Or you know whatever, I don't think you need an, if you don't have a big sales team you don't need to worry about routing in the way that you do with.

293
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:32,500
You know many people It's just not an issue you're dealing with so that's the other thing.

294
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,000
I think that's like a thing.

295
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,500
I would say Tech has cool.

296
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:45,600
The martic is really cool but like some of those only are opportunities at scale and so like if you have a one-person marketing team and a one-person sales team, like do you really need this?

297
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,800
It's good.

298
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
No, that's good.

299
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,300
All right.

300
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
Well, let us go in and myth.

301
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:55,500
Number 20, can't chat GPT run.

302
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
My marketing team question mark.

303
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
No question.

304
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
I don't think so.

305
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:17,100
I know and if you look at like I can't, I mean I got a slack from somebody that said like, hey here's some marketing strategy AI tool, and I was like, And they were like, well, would you use this?

306
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,000
And I was like, no, I write my own strategy.

307
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:29,300
Like, I, isn't that what you pay me for like no, I wouldn't use that but like you can't AI your way out of a problem yet.

308
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,800
Like the AI, isn't there?

309
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:45,300
You know, like a I was really good at doing like a really a, to be line thing like with living within a box and I think that you need to understand more than anything what you're putting into something if you're going.

310
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,900
Anything else out of it?

311
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,300
Like I said I use Jasper.

312
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,900
But like if you can't tell Jasper.

313
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,700
Hey Jasper.

314
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,800
I need you to write me exactly this post with this as a message line and this is like the kicker and the audience and everything I want.

315
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:07,200
Like it's really just doing the writing, it's not doing the ideas, and so I don't know like I am really ants I think.

316
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,700
Yeah.

317
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:16,100
By the idea that there's like if there's a I run, it's somehow like a good tool and I see so many of them, you know, we get sent all the time.

318
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:21,200
It's like we're going to do AI routing, and we go to do it everything lead scoring.

319
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,500
We're going to do AI this, and we have machine learning on this and a proprietary algorithm.

320
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,400
I have heard that term a lot its patented.

321
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:37,700
I am like okay I worked in an IP patent for him is like one of my first jobs and I can tell you right now, you can get a patent for anything as long as like the words don't exist in the world.

322
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:42,800
That doesn't mean it's like groundbreaking Tech and so, I don't know.

323
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,000
Like, I think that's just a, it's a sad state for marketing that.

324
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,400
Like, that's what we're marketers are selling to the world, which means, like as a marketer, you're going to come in, and they're going to be like, well, why do I need you?

325
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Like I run on LinkedIn that you could, you don't.

326
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,400
I mean, I just got a flag, I read on LinkedIn.

327
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,800
You don't need an outbound team anymore.

328
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,900
The marketing team should just send sequences and that's more efficient.

329
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,200
I was like Okay.

330
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,700
I mean I sure but also like at what cost, what's the conversion rate versus a personalized?

331
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,200
Email?

332
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:23,000
If you were able to give a targeted list to a bdr team or an SDR team and personalize all those emails from the get go and do multi-touch, do you get more bang for your buck?

333
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,100
Like that's you should test that.

334
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,900
Like, I don't know the answer, but I think that those are the questions that people aren't asking.

335
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,500
They're just like, oh, I read it on LinkedIn and I can give you like crazy.

336
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,100
I mean, I ran a scr team and like the LinkedIn Str world is quite Big.

337
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,000
And I feel like marketing is kind of like that too.

338
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,900
And, you know, yeah, 20 there was like this, this thing like you should send a break up email.

339
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,400
No, you shouldn't send a breakup email like if they have a responded to you and you're just like I feel like I am not getting the message.

340
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,100
Yeah you're not getting the message, they're not going to respond to that email.

341
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,200
Like that's its a numbers game.

342
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,900
It's not a lake or.

343
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,200
And they also said like oh if you put in typos people will think it's a human.

344
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,699
No.

345
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,600
It turns out.

346
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Google will just Spam block you.

347
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,300
So like just don't do that.

348
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:18,699
Like it's simple and you know like that's the examples of like people read.

349
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,400
Finally.

350
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,800
Also, once it's working for him, it's already not working by the time, he posts about that.

351
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,199
So you probably shouldn't listen to No One's Gonna Give You their, like, Masters stop.

352
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,699
Like I just wouldn't, that's just not how it works.

353
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:33,900
But anyway.

354
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,600
Yeah, I mean, my husband is, it's funny.

355
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:45,100
My husband is big in crypto, and he often talks about like, oh, I am gonna get this AI to do my marketing strategy, and I am like good luck with that.

356
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:51,400
You let me know how that pans out, and he's like, he's like I tried it and it was Isn't very good.

357
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,800
No, yeah.

358
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,000
So basically you're seeing anything pretty much.

359
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,400
It needs to be led driven strategically by humans and yeah, and I think the same thing with nortec.

360
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,900
Like, if you don't know why you're buying a tool, you're never going to get value out of it like, you know, be strategic.

361
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,300
I think I can't buy 70 tools and like I think that's something that's like a big difference in.

362
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,300
Like it took me years to get here, right?

363
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,700
Like it's not like I did that.

364
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,600
I did the same s***.

365
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,400
Like I just need everything to My life better.

366
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,200
Like I am going to be the best of my job.

367
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,600
If I buy drift, I am going to be the best of my job if I said do.

368
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,900
So I am going to be the best of my job if I buy whatever.

369
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:41,700
But like if you start to look at it long term and you actually see the budgets and the way that this is done at the top and the way people are reporting to boards and the way that through actually accountable to this marketing is accountable, for cost of acquisition, usually across marketing.

370
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,400
So that includes software, spend what that means is.

371
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,700
If you have a big software spend, you can't spend as much money on ads.

372
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,800
You can't do the fun stuff.

373
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,500
You can't run branded campaigns you.

374
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,800
Can't do Billboards, you can't do cool stuff.

375
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:00,100
You know, there's something to be said for out-of-home media and like that is expensive.

376
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,800
And it's not a play for Legion, but it's you can't do that.

377
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,800
If you spend all your money on Mark Tech like and why I would rather do that.

378
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,000
So well anyway, Julie you have such Rich experience.

379
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,400
I just want to hear one of your experiences coming into a marketing team.

380
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:28,000
For the first time you're the head of the marketing and what's the first thing you do?

381
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,600
Yeah, I do the same thing everywhere.

382
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:40,700
So I think I am hired for like, you know, I say I am a revenue base marketer if they're looking for like a brand person, or they're looking for a product marketer, they're probably not going to hire me.

383
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,300
So usually when I come in there's a reason and it's like DG is the problem.

384
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,500
And so, first thing I do is I assess the agency and I run.

385
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
My own attribution model.

386
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,500
I tell everyone and I have this is the thing about attribution.

387
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,000
That kills me.

388
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,300
I think it's there is no, there is no perfect world.

389
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:13,200
There is no perfect attribution and you need to just be consistent across the board, like just pick something and go with it and like if you don't have 16 analysts and you're not You don't know everything.

390
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:28,400
The best way to go is first touch because I mean that specifically because you want to give as much especially when you're looking at budgets you want to power up your paid advertisements as much as possible because often a most of the conversions are going to happen whether they heard about you organically first or not.

391
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:38,300
You want to make sure that you're capturing as much of your paid advertisement into conversion as possible in an early stage company, or mid-stage, even, or even sometimes later stage.

392
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,200
And I think that, like, that's the first thing I do is Like we're running first hunch, I wanted across-the-board.

393
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,300
I go to a data team if they have it, if not, I am like scampering around trying to find it.

394
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,900
I say I want a model built this way.

395
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,300
I want my cost per conversion on each point I had like an actual spreadsheet.

396
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,900
I give them and then I tell them like I need the state at like ASAP.

397
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:04,000
And I am going to build a model to at least goal where we should be on all of these to hit our goals as a company.

398
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,300
And that's, I begin there every time.

399
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:18,000
So it's usually the agency or the in-house paid crew is like getting a big Dragon eye on them or whatever you call it, like a dagger where I come in and a bull's-eye, and I am like, what are you doing?

400
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,900
And I think the easiest way to solve that problem is often just to throw out the agency and start over with a new one.

401
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:48,800
And just like and if painful like those people aren't bad people, you know, like I have had to let go of people who were great but like I need a clean slate to start over and That you can't often do with an in-house or with the people who have done it the way, they have done it because they were unwilling to kind of like revisit.

402
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,900
And the second thing I do is I make sure if they have segment running, I usually don't join a company that doesn't have segmented.

403
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,300
I do like some research on that beforehand just because it makes my life so much better.

404
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:09,100
I use segment, I take as much of the I am working on this, you know, in currently and I will probably always be working on this, but I am taking as much of the data as possible out of our marketing attribution.

405
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,100
Our marketing, it's not attribution you.

406
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,500
Use that word and I will suppose my head, I am marketing, what they called automation?

407
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:27,500
I take as much of that out of reporting out of Marketing automation as possible and get a dash boarded on a bi tool like Tableau or look or something like that, if possible.

408
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,200
So you can use the segment data and then use first touch their.

409
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,000
I think that's cleaner.

410
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,500
It's a place to start.

411
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,200
I mean, I would love to be in a world where we were running, you know, a w attribution.

412
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:47,700
It will but for now like at least I have a number to go off of and then I can go back and say like, all right, you're costing me this much per lead.

413
00:39:47,800 --> 00:40:12,800
This much per sales qualified lead, this punch for close lost or close one and then I can Baseline and I can improve and I can then look at like the niche within each area and say like all right your landing page conversion is horrific let us like fix that or you know the leads are bad like it's The sales team is complaining their bad.

414
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:25,100
I don't fight that fight at the sales, team tells me, they don't like believes, I am just like yeah okay they're probably got and I start there and like ice cream done the due diligence to actually see the data.

415
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,300
Exactly and it's easy.

416
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:41,100
If they are like if you look and it's like wow we're spending two hundred thousand dollars on every close one we have and the sales team is like I just work, s*** leads all day and 90% of their revenue is or there are Advertising is a Facebook you're like huh?

417
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:53,800
Yeah, okay, well let us turn that off and then you can take that money and like, you know, you can steal from Peter to pay Paul but you don't, you can hire people.

418
00:40:54,100 --> 00:41:02,600
People are really helpful, you can invest in, you know, I think the, this is why I like a, I can't do your marketing without great content.

419
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,500
Like your kind of f***** anyway, because what are they going to do?

420
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,100
They hit your website.

421
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,800
They don't know what you do.

422
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,500
They hate your website.

423
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,100
You have no social.

424
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:18,800
Proof, you know, you want like to build that resource center and so you can hire content writers, you can, there's a lot of stuff you can do with the money.

425
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,500
That's being spent on more Tech in my opinion and like I came into one company.

426
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,100
I save them almost a million dollars.

427
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,100
Whoo.

428
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,500
In March Tech buys and you know, events and you name it.

429
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,300
And events are cool.

430
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,700
And I Big Brand play but like, unless you can directly see a correlation to revenue, like there.

431
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,300
I don't think it worth do it.

432
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:41,800
You want it?

433
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,200
You got to keep it real with you.

434
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:50,200
We do see a correlation with that's I mean that and I some people do like in and I think well you're I mean that makes sense.

435
00:41:50,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Like first of all you're a vent platform and say like people are like oh this is cool like and that makes sense to me and but like most companies aren't seeing that, you know, they're spending three hundred four hundred thousand dollars on an event, and then they assume like, There are companies that have done an amazing job as an events.

436
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,700
Like, I worked with a marketing operations person from Anna plan and like, they were an event machine.

437
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,500
Like, they got all their leads from events, they knew how to work them.

438
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,700
They knew what they were doing, but she was always like when you to do events, and I was like, well, we have done them a lot.

439
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,300
Like, for us, it has really done that.

440
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:38,300
And I think like, you can get a sense, you know if there's like a right and it depends on your buying cycle to like if you can get somebody.

441
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:46,400
To see you in a booth and like they're willing to buy pretty fast and yeah of course Double Down, triple down, go everywhere.

442
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,400
Do it all good.

443
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:55,700
How long does it take like to do that whole evaluation process until you're at the point where like, okay all the boxes are checked.

444
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,300
I have got my dashboards and place got the right team.

445
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,000
I have got all the things in place.

446
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,200
How long does that take?

447
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:18,900
You know, I am really lucky in that I have like a core team that comes with me, but it takes me about a month to on board into a company and learn where everything is.

448
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,000
That's like the hardest part.

449
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,400
Like what?

450
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,600
Where is it?

451
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,900
And then it takes me about a month to ramp my team.

452
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,200
I do that kind of in tandem.

453
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:33,300
So like a month and a half year at, usually, they're 22 months, I am fully ramped, usually around 3 months.

454
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,500
Like I am ready to go.

455
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,300
I always want to cut it down but it takes me about that long to end.

456
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,500
And usually I mean depends on how bad things are, right?

457
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:52,500
Like it at one of the companies I was at and like I don't want to go into names but I definitely had a win within two weeks that like transform my life.

458
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,200
You know.

459
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,500
I took their cost of a sales qualified lead from 20K to the eight hundred dollars in two weeks.

460
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,300
And like, how did you do that?

461
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,400
It's just reporting.

462
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:05,300
Well, I said, well, let us do first touch and I they were driving everything to a website to free.

463
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,900
To a free product to the homepage, and I was like, huh?

464
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:11,800
That doesn't make a lot of sense.

465
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:26,300
And then within the free product like it wasn't set up to convert like the product wasn't built as a sales tool right like it'd be kind of got lost in there, and so I took all the traffic and I moved it to gated landing pages which is like super old school.

466
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,400
By the way this is like be to be 101.

467
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,000
I took all the data we had and lucky for me.

468
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:41,400
They have been doing this long time, so I had a lot of data and I went through on a keyword level through like you can just tie it all in on segment all the way to revenue.

469
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,200
Like, and I was just like anything that has not closed one on a keyword in x amount of time we kill.

470
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,700
And so it was their entire keyword list went away overnight.

471
00:44:51,700 --> 00:45:06,400
We got it down to like, you know, 40 keywords, and then it grew because I mean obviously I didn't keep it at $900 but that's like I reduce spends quite a bit too but like, I kept it at a very reasonable rate for a very long time.

472
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:25,400
You know, something that's market conditions but I do think like, I can see, correlations between like when I was out or when somebody else Managed IT, and I can see the psych urge in marketers, particularly paid marketers to spend more and, and I see this all the time, actually, in Tech this urge to change things.

473
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:36,400
I change it, change it, make it better, make it better but like actually if you think through your strategy from the get-go and you hold course in like the times of uncertainty you make.

474
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:46,900
Better decisions and like you do pivot your strategy but like if you hold longer your normalizing the data better and that is like the thing that a I can't do right?

475
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,800
Because it's going to Pivot all the time and that's not a good strategy.

476
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:58,700
Like Adding keywords all the time and adding more negative keywords and taking away things and like, doing that constantly is like very unproductive.

477
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:06,800
And like, yes, you want to do that in your agency's, doing that on some level, but like, you don't want to be a bipolar marketer.

478
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:18,800
I don't know about you, but I definitely manage paid when I go in every day and be like, oh, we go And then I say that everything and I read you the ads like and I got so paranoid.

479
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,500
I had this SDR team helping me.

480
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,300
I was like what do you think, will convert?

481
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:22,700
You know?

482
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,700
And like that's not great.

483
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,300
That's not a great situation Gone With the Wind what they're doing.

484
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:27,600
Yeah.

485
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:40,000
And then it's and then you don't know like you don't have any data about what's working, and so I like really learned from that experience of asking this por Ser to help me make banners.

486
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,100
And from that point forward, I have kind of Never done that.

487
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:48,600
I just hold like I am like okay I believe in this, and I am going to give it like before I launch.

488
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:55,300
I am like I am going to give it this amount of time this is the right amount of time and I just sit and then I like and then I learned to manage up, right?

489
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,800
Like I am just like, don't worry about it.

490
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,600
I got my Wong is a good amount of time to let it sit.

491
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,600
I think it depends on, you know, again, you're buying cycle.

492
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,700
Like, I think it takes a month.

493
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:13,100
It really takes a month in most B2B companies to get a really good feel on what quality is.

494
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,400
Is coming in because you have got generally, like, these are huge generalization.

495
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,700
Some people are much more efficient and this is where tooling becomes an important, right?

496
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:28,000
Like if you have a big sales team and you can shorten your Cycles like yeah, that's like holy s***.

497
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:35,200
That's when you buy tools because like every day you can shorten that sales cycle, it's more money in the door, it's better for everybody.

498
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,200
But like until you're at that point.

499
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,300
Don't do that.

500
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:46,300
But basically I think it takes like a lead comes in takes about a month.

501
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,400
Usually between scheduling and like getting them on a phone to get them like qualified.

502
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:00,900
Sometimes two weeks, I am trying to get it down to two weeks like but I try to give it a month at least at first and then shorten as needed and that's slow.

503
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:07,100
But I think you know instinct is everything and Everyone's probably read blank.

504
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:13,500
It's like going to date me so badly but Malcolm Gladwell was like, oh if you just like train for 10,000 hours, you can be a violinist or whatever.

505
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:19,800
But like and then his whole Spiel was like that ultimately what your training is intuition.

506
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,300
And so it's like in every gut, check the gut check is right?

507
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:40,400
And that's where you need to go as a marketer and like, I have done this a lot, so I have a pretty good Instinct on it, but like, I think that like there's yeah, I will go to my myth number three, like, which is like you, you need to spend money to make money, like not true, it's not true.

508
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,700
You need to spend some money.

509
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:50,700
Like you can't run a company without spending money, but I would spend that money on people, like humans are worth more, like they're more valuable.

510
00:48:51,100 --> 00:49:03,800
And there's this misnomer that like oh hey if I just have all the data if I just get more data, like I get this all the time, they like we want like more quiet like more For more fun and like, what are you going to do with it?

511
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,600
You can't even manage like the 6 inputs.

512
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:24,300
We have right now like what we're going to add more to this like you're just in a bad situation and so yeah, I really focus on that is like, and I think that you, if you run a really streamline marketing team, the things that actually matter in the things that can make the difference or like how you're doing the research into all of that and your product marketing team.

513
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:31,500
So like if you have a nice tight Loop or you're talking to your customers and you're getting feedback from them, you know what, ads to run You know what?

514
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,100
Two platforms.

515
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:32,500
They're on.

516
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:45,100
You're getting a lot of information and then if you're tracking it rights and you have like a good attribution system setup that's like kind of can't break, which means there's its your own system, you're pretty safe.

517
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,800
Like you can be a conservative marketer for a while until you're ready to make big bets.

518
00:49:49,800 --> 00:50:00,800
And like, there are times that I made huge, huge bets that are paid off in some Heaven, you know, like that's kind of the name of the game in marketing but like I have run big competitor.

519
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,700
Ads for spent a fortune on them.

520
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,200
Sometimes that works.

521
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,100
Sometimes it doesn't.

522
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:10,600
I have done huge conferences again like I don't know.

523
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,800
Anyway that's like--that's what I would say.

524
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,600
Yeah, okay, I am like all over the place, so I am going to, I love it.

525
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,400
Nope, we're tracking.

526
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,200
And we have got a couple of great questions.

527
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,000
Let us pull up this first question here.

528
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:33,800
How important is marketing Ops when it comes to building your marketing house?

529
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:39,200
I think that marketing Ops is the most important thing you can do is actually, I spend the most time now.

530
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:47,100
I start there because if your track like again this comes down to like how do you ingest the data?

531
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:51,700
And like there's a lot of talk around vanity metrics and like what is a vanity metric?

532
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:59,500
And like well if you go to, if you're tracking everything, you don't know what's important.

533
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,200
Like all data is not information.

534
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:14,000
Like it's like if you don't know what the important thing is I go back to this all the time, the Heap is like a tool that I have used in the past and one of the things that really irks me about It is like Jose tiger, everything like just take it all like the colors.

535
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,400
It is like everything's tag and then nobody knows what to look at.

536
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:25,800
And they're like, well, you know, like they hovered on the page for 20 minutes, and I am like, So like what are you trying to do on this page?

537
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,100
Like what is your goal?

538
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:39,100
And if you can't tell me that and data makes that hard like the world of data makes that really hard we have this like a human instinct to be like weirdos better and that's how you manage upright like you strip out the math, the metrics.

539
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,500
You give them the core of what they're looking for.

540
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,500
It's like hey your business is growing like stop looking at the MTL number.

541
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:50,400
Stop looking at like all of this you're going to get a feedback loop from sales like stop stressing out.

542
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,800
Like it's going to be okay.

543
00:51:53,300 --> 00:52:08,600
But yeah, that's kind of like my like mentality, I don't know, like, I have been like a kind of polarizing picture figurehead here because like, I think, Everyone has a different Vision on this, and but I think marketing office is like, the single most important thing you can do.

544
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,300
If you don't have a good mql system.

545
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:16,700
If you can't, like if you don't have an mql process and a standardized mql process, then your data is all over the place, right?

546
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:22,000
Like and your reactive and reactivity is never wins ever.

547
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:33,400
It's all about being thoughtful and I think Marketing in particular is the most important team to do that because like we are the team that is caught.

548
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:40,900
But first, we are the team that is seen as I have never worked in a job that someone hasn't overtly told me I am sure I could do that.

549
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:50,000
I am like, could you, you know, it's like everyone thinks they can just do it because it's all over the Internet and Linkedin is telling them they can.

550
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,700
And Facebook's telling them they can.

551
00:52:51,700 --> 00:53:01,400
Everyone is there's a book about it but like again I think that actually the patients and the like having a really strong foundation in marketing Ops is like where you win.

552
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,400
Its I would lead score.

553
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,600
The thing that I have done consistently that has been a game-changer.

554
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:18,800
It's like, dude, I don't know how many people in the room or that I am talking to you, or, like, the cro has, like a magic tool book like a cro comes in, and does this like pricing magic where Revenue grows?

555
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,800
And it's like everyone's happy, and they just like increased prices, but they did it right?

556
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,500
And they deserve a lot of credit for that because they figured out what the exact number is, right.

557
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:33,300
But like, I think that lead scoring is like that marketer Magic Moment where it's just like poof, we have the information.

558
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,900
We need we can run nurtures, we can push people.

559
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:53,600
We can open up leads when we need to, we can do a lot of things and like that's super old school and I think it's the thing that when you buy all this tool set you're not spending the time doing that foundational piece and like you know, I think that's like where you choose your marketing operations person wisely have.

560
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:58,000
A lot of power, is that one of your fashion Community mouth Talent?

561
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,400
That's the most important higher.

562
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:00,900
I hire.

563
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:19,100
I know I also think about like one thing I will say is like teen is really important to like people are only people and I think if you is there's a disruptive element to a team or there are people that don't make people feel comfortable and build trust like you're totally screwed.

564
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:35,800
So I spend a lot of energy on like who is going to add value to the team and less about the roles sometimes which is weird but it's more data is How important is we're going to the same question but cool.

565
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,400
Then finish your thought, I think like yeah.

566
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:48,000
I think like your team and your relationship with your team is so important because if you're afraid to fail in front of the people in that room and the Mark, I always tell I come in, and I start a marketing team.

567
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,100
The same no matter where I am.

568
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,900
Like this is a circle of trust now, like, you can say anything in this room, this room is safe.

569
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,000
This is a safe space.

570
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,000
We fail all the time and marketing, like, that's the thing.

571
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
People don't realize, like half the.

572
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,700
I am sure.

573
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,800
Every marketer can tell you a story about something really f****** dumb.

574
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,300
They did and I have my own way.

575
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:15,100
Believe me like Iran a million like hundreds of thousands of dollars without putting the tags on them, and I was just like oops you know, like we all make mistakes.

576
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:23,100
But if you lie about it and you cover it up and you're not able to come to the people that can help you like that's when you get into trouble.

577
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:48,900
And also if you're not, if you're not a little afraid, I would like feel comfortable feeling, you don't try anything and like you're not willing to take those big bats and So that's actually probably where I spend more energy, and so I probably higher product marketing, and like content DG first, but the third I have hired, you know, I have done a host of things where, like, I have outsourcers I was lucky in this job.

578
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:57,000
It was like something I looked at is I strong as the parking off steam before I joined because I didn't want to rebuild that again.

579
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,500
But it is something.

580
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,300
I spend a lot of time on and it's something I care about a lot, I think.

581
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,400
A lot about the sales status has to, in a way, that's weird for a marketer.

582
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,400
I think that the campaign stamping is like so important.

583
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,000
And then another thing that people are really f****** bad at naming conventions, like taking it back too.

584
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,000
Yeah, like just be consistent.

585
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,800
I think that's the it's like tooling can't do that for you.

586
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:20,600
So good.

587
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:28,400
You need to do that process consistency, process, process and like that's probably like I do that.

588
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:34,900
And the other thing I do when I build a team that I think is like, core is I give everyone in the floor for a long time.

589
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,400
Like I don't level the team really at first.

590
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:47,400
I put everyone in a room, and I am like, all right, we're all going to have this like lead meeting together.

591
00:56:47,500 --> 00:57:00,700
Until I feel that like the teens are functional in a way that like, I can just talk to the directors or whoever is leading the function because I think visibility is like also Really huge portent.

592
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,300
Yeah, and I am not a siloed work is a problem.

593
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,400
That's a whole nother topic.

594
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:13,400
We have got two more questions here, so I wanted to tackle these before.

595
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:22,400
Our time is up, if more data isn't better, is there a general data point that you found to be really useful across any company?

596
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,000
Yeah.

597
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:28,300
So Three things I guess.

598
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:40,100
Like when you're looking at advertising, it's I guess it's like there's like if you look at your big ecosystem you want to know the conversion rate from lead to mql by your core channels, inbound outbound whatever.

599
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,800
The mix has infinite.

600
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:54,300
You want to know, then a standardized mql to sales qualified or some version of that marketing qualified to sales qualified and you want to know sales qualified to close one, you need those to do your job, right?

601
00:57:54,300 --> 00:58:07,000
Like that's where you begin and then you Ali want to know by Channel like the time because usually the channels differentiate quite a bit and their conversion rates times like a LinkedIn lead doesn't usually convert as fast as a Google leaved.

602
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:30,500
You want to be very cognizant of that because what happens is that part that people don't see is like often with a big raise comes a big model where it's like we need to grow a hundred thousand million dollars tomorrow and you're like oh okay and there's a model there's always a model and how that model is structured is like how you Able to figure out what to do and like what you need to do and how many people you need to hire?

603
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:42,500
And like you know, that's the core of that problem set and so you need to know the times and you need to know the cost and then from there I think but really my like my most important number is always the cost.

604
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:46,700
Usually I like I said about sales qualified lead or an Excel is accepted lead or something.

605
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:53,400
Some version of that state it's an easy one to get usually everyone can understand it.

606
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,200
And then I think I tried very much to.

607
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,700
Then when I present above, it's like marketing leads.

608
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:12,000
I don't try, I don't like tell them the differentiations that much because I don't want anybody digging into the house until it's ready to like be presented and I think you want to give people autonomy.

609
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:22,500
So generally you're like, I don't know what his bill you do but like generally, you know, best like what your number should be and if you don't like, you need to ask the question, like, what is the goal of my job?

610
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,200
Okay, that's my f****** number.

611
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,500
Like how do I drive that and then focus on the top?

612
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,500
Like, you know I it's funny we run SEO in a really weird way.

613
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:39,900
I do look at visits to the website and Trends over time but like I am looking for consistency not like do we get 200,000 visits today?

614
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:46,200
Like okay cool like Jeff you know, like I think that's where you get in trouble and so like we want to find consistent patterns.

615
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,100
So yeah, I don't be more data better.

616
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,500
No, I don't think so, but so good.

617
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,100
You know, people would argue with me.

618
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,300
They do all Time.

619
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I think you're getting a lot of nodding heads and our crowd here so you can take a look at chat and cool.

620
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,000
One more question.

621
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:14,400
When you say that you prefer to look at marketing data in a bi tool, like Tableau alongside your other data, what's the best way that you found to get data out of HubSpot?

622
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,700
That's such a great question.

623
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,200
We use HubSpot by the way.

624
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,100
I am not the biggest HubSpot ban, so I like Marketo better.

625
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,600
So that's like bit of a thing.

626
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,900
A spy last.

627
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,900
Yeah, I mean the UI is much better and HubSpot like, let us just be real.

628
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,300
Like it's a beautiful Much Better Built tool like Marketo.

629
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,600
I am just like 1990 called like when are you going to update the s***?

630
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:42,800
And also, like, in Marketo the, it's like, you can't get out of a tab like you can literally open a tab and can't get back.

631
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,200
Like you gotta like, click out Mike.

632
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,500
Its horrific product.

633
01:00:47,400 --> 01:01:05,400
The like 121 sync with Salesforce is really valuable and you can do a lot more advanced routings in my Experienced in Marketo because if you're using Salesforce like the complexity of the Salesforce ecosystem and the amount of tools sitting on Salesforce.

634
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:13,400
If you have a big sales team, I think that Marketo is just a superior tool because it has a better eye frame for the sales team to like go in.

635
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,400
And like if you can do the interesting moments and you can do all sorts of stuff.

636
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,800
We're like HubSpot I don't think is as good as out yet.

637
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,900
I know they claim they are but like, in my opinion.

638
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,500
Also, like, I don't know, I mean Market in Marketo my whole life.

639
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,500
I have used Marketo my whole life.

640
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:35,100
It's hard to like, doesn't anybody ever feel like you have been sold something and you don't believe you were, like, good at your job unless you use a certain tool.

641
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:42,000
I feel like Marketo did a pretty good job with me, their sales force to on it, like, I don't know.

642
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,500
But yeah, I did that.

643
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,600
Try to get the data out.

644
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:55,500
Okay, so I think this is really complicated, so we do build a lot of attribution and HubSpot and a lot of the like, Like core reporting is and HubSpot right now.

645
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,200
I am having it all transferred back into a bi tool.

646
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,000
I don't know how they're doing that though.

647
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:02,900
To be honest.

648
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,400
They're doing like an API.

649
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,300
Think they're running into segments with all of the events.

650
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,300
I also don't use anymore.

651
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,800
I don't use Marketo or HubSpot for landing pages.

652
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:19,700
I am a big fan of webflow right now and I build, you know all of my landing pages in one tool.

653
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:23,100
I didn't use to do that but like, I really think that's the future.

654
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,800
And like, why would you have another?

655
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:44,100
I Used to Love instapage by the way, loves it but like they're ugly and web flow is beautiful and your designers like you get you look like a designer and I think that just makes your life easier and then with a good CMS like you can just drop a form code anywhere and so like I don't know.

656
01:02:44,200 --> 01:03:00,300
So that's how I am getting the data out and like that's why I like Salesforce so much because like basically you can push everything you need into Salesforce and then run that directly into Aunt, if I could direct call or pipe, whatever you want to call it and I don't know how well HubSpot does that.

657
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:03,700
I think it doesn't pretty well though, so I am just not as versed on it.

658
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,300
That's how I do it.

659
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,200
Amazing.

660
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,200
Wow, we're even over time, 3 minutes here.

661
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,300
Oh s***.

662
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,300
This is really, this is been so rich.

663
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,100
Thank you.

664
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,000
Okay, I am sorry.

665
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:28,300
I could talk in a while like it's like, oh yeah, we could probably do another session with you and we should but this is beautiful software by the way.

666
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:32,600
I am so impressed with your I am going to talk to my team.

667
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,200
I don't know what it cost but I don't buy software.

668
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,400
It, is it?

669
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,700

Pain.

696
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:32,500
Can wait.

697
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:38,400
We're only watching the skies hoping for the best but expecting the worst.

698
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,300
Are you gonna drop the bomb?

699
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:46,200
Now let us die young or let us live forever.

700
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,300
We don't have power for me.

701
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,700
Never seen it.

702
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,100
Sitting in a sandpit.

703
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,000
Life is a short trip.

704
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,900
The musics for the sad man.

705
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,800
Can you imagine this one?

706
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:06,100
Can I go now faces into the sun prison?

707
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,200
Our leaders.

708
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,300
We get into music played by the mud man.

709
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:09,700
Someone like what is someone like the he some of the many in some other be sooner or later they all will be gone.

710
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:19,400
Why don't they stay it's so hard to get on without it cause I don't want to perish.

711
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:27,600
Like a fading us cues like diamonds in the Sun and diamonds are forever.

1
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,600
Still, enough time to figure out how to Chase.

2
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,700
When?

3
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,800
Who loves me?

4
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,200
Aloha.

5
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,900
How's everyone doing?

6
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,100
It's so great to be here with you all.

7
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,100
I see that some of you are tuning in from places that are super cold.

8
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,000
So make sure you're bundling up, sorry to say I am in Hawaii over here.

9
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,100
So I complain too much about the weather today, but I am really excited about the conversation.

10
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,300
We have a special guest.

11
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,600
Her name is Julie.

12
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,899
Ginchy is the VP of demand gen at lob, and she's going to be joining very shortly.

13
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:24,800
But we're going to be talking about the yin-yang relationship of demand gen and marketing.

14
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,700
Ops believe it or not, that there are such synergies when you can bring them together.

15
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:38,300
Because so often we are all running, you know, millions of miles per hour with all the things going on these days.

16
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,300
So it's like, okay, well I am gonna do my thing here.

17
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,900
You're gonna do your thing here and it's so often that we operate inside.

18
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,500
Lows.

19
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:56,200
And so today, we're going to dive deep into the synergies of bringing demand gen and marketing Ops together along with the significance of getting the data, right?

20
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,400
Connecting the demand channels, adding data intelligence getting the mark Tech Integrations, right?

21
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,500
And then delivering the campaign in sight.

22
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,200
So with that Julie, come join me on stage.

23
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,800
Hello, hello there.

24
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,900
Thank you for having me.

25
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,900
How are you?

26
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,300
I am good.

27
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,500
I am very cold.

28
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,700
I am freezing.

29
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,600
My, my tush off outside of Portland Oregon, but other than that I am doing great.

30
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,300
Well stay warm get a lot of lattes bundle up.

31
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,100
It is beautiful.

32
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,600
I like your plant behind you.

33
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,100
So you're tuning in from Portland.

34
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,000
I have got this fun little map here that kind of shows like where were at time zone wise.

35
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,300
If Sal, you don't mind pulling that up there.

36
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,300
So I have got this here where we're just, you know, ocean and ocean apart, Julie.

37
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,500
I am so jealous.

38
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,700
I wish I was closer to you.

39
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:10,000
You're welcome, anytime, and another fun fact that you recently shared with me, is that you're quite tall.

40
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,800
Yeah.

41
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,900
So that's another way we're opposites, right?

42
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:26,700
You know, I think Now that I meet most people over Zoom, they have no idea that I am actually 6 feet tall which makes me taller than you know 99% of the women on the planet but yeah, it's funny.

43
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,200
Nobody knows.

44
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,000
I think it's some point I could start telling people.

45
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I am actually a centaur and that the bottom half of me is a mythical creature, and they went no, and I am like 5 feet tall.

46
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,500
So like you said Polar Opposites opposite sides of the you know spectrum and location and height.

47
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,800
So that's so awesome.

48
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,400
Okay.

49
00:06:49,700 --> 00:07:02,600
Well Julie, I would love to hear a little bit about your story and how you got into, first of all, B2B marketing and demand gen of all things.

50
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,700
Yeah, true.

51
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:05,900
Yeah.

52
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,900
So okay.

53
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,000
So origin story in a nutshell.

54
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,700
I got into B2B marketing by way of graphic design.

55
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,000
So I actually started my career with working with a lot of really wonderful B2B.

56
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:27,500
Marketing leaders who became very good friends and I work with them to launch campaigns and it didn't take me very long to realize, I want to do more than just the visual communication style.

57
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,500
So I wanted to work on targeting channel strategy analytics in the content.

58
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,200
So, for the first few years of my career, I took this kind of yes.

59
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:46,500
And approach like yes, I will design your brochure and I want to have some say in how we go to market with this product and that was over 20 years ago, right?

60
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:56,200
And that led me to transition from corporate marketing role to eventually went to an agency role and then I got two Dimensions specifically and once I was in demand, and I was pretty much hooked.

61
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:08,900
I mean, it was that magical combination of data and creativity which is my sweet spot and I haven't looked back And we're going to dive into the data and creativity with some of the insights going to share with us.

62
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,600
That's great.

63
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,300
And can you share with us today?

64
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,200
What do you do at lob?

65
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,600
What Is Love?

66
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Who do you want sir?

67
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,400
Yeah so a lob is Direct Mail automation platform.

68
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:32,500
I joined about a year and a half ago as you mentioned, the VP of demand gen, and I am responsible for everything from net, new name acquisition to the handoff of qualified sales.

69
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,200
Opportunities.

70
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,100
Gotcha, awesome.

71
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,600
All right, well I would love to jump right into our topic for today.

72
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:48,900
And we're going to be talking about the yin-yang relationship of demand, gen and marketing Ops.

73
00:08:48,900 --> 00:09:03,700
And, you know, one of the first questions that comes to mind is, what is it that creates the misalignment between demand gen and marketing Ops, What a great question.

74
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:19,900
So you know, first I have to start here and tell you that I have had the honor of working with amazing marketing operations people throughout my career and I have learned so much from them and I credit them for helping me move her forward in my career but I have seen this a lot of right?

75
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,100
The two teams think very differently so the mop steam often.

76
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,800
Lee thinks often thinks orchestration right?

77
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,800
And the demand gen team is thinking by your experience.

78
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,800
So, I will share a story from a colleague from a while ago, which I think really illustrates this.

79
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:47,600
She was really upset because her Ops team had decided to add two additional forms to our website because it was necessary for lead routing, and they were focused on how to operate operationalize.

80
00:09:47,600 --> 00:10:05,100
This asked about the leads, so they were thinking of data from her point of view, that was a horrible, customer experience that she was worried, it would torpedo her conversion rates, she was thinking of the customer experience first and the funnel and that I think in a nutshell is Can cause friction success.

81
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,300
Such a good way to describe it.

82
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:24,000
So, like, even when you go into organizations and, you know, first marketing leader that's coming in to fix things, for example, what's, what's the first thing that you do to start Bridging?

83
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,200
The two Well, the first thing is, I always ask to people that presumption of good intent, right?

84
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,400
We're all trying to solve the problem.

85
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:42,100
And then, I have actually done this exercise where I tell people visualize the problem, and then realize it is not between the demand gen people and the marketing Ops people.

86
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,700
It's not, it's not between you, it's over here and you guys have to both turn and look at that and solve it together.

87
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,500
It's really good.

88
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,100
Okay.

89
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,800
And what's the response?

90
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,900
Because they're wired differently.

91
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,400
So how do you get them to work together?

92
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,600
Part of it is its very similar.

93
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,300
Actually I have seen a similar friction point between demand Jed and like the web development team.

94
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,600
They speak different languages, right?

95
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,800
So to the best of your ability, if you can be that language translator between demand and marketing hops, right?

96
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,300
And help them understand what their goals are not how to get their vote there.

97
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,000
Or what you're trying to achieve?

98
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,400
That goes a long way too, kind of healing that friction.

99
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,700
Mmm, that's good.

100
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:39,700
And then from a, just a team structure perspective, what does that usually look like is there, is it one person responsible for all of demand gen one person responsible for marketing Ops, or could there be multiple people on each team and what are their roles?

101
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,700
So that depends very heavily on the size of your team, the team maturity, right?

102
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,300
Your growth and all of that, you know, but I think what is works really well.

103
00:11:49,400 --> 00:12:01,500
Well, if you can get to the place where you can have one person, who is the head of operations, and has an analytics person, and also like a campaign operation person reporting into her, then that works very well.

104
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:10,700
And then you have a person who is the head of demand gen and also has maybe a BM person, underneath them, growth marketing, customer marketing, all of that reporting into them.

105
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,300
So then you have a single person who heads up both of those areas that can hopefully be in lock step towards your goals, interesting.

106
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,700
So what I am hearing Because you mentioned ABM growth and customer marketing.

107
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:30,900
That's pretty much the customer lifecycle, like, you see, that whole life cycle then reporting into the head of the Mansion.

108
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,200
Yeah.

109
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,500
And so, again, that goes back to what the purpose of demand gen is right.

110
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,000
So, in my current role, I am very much focused on that new logo acquisition.

111
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,400
But in other positions, I have been responsible for full pipeline creation across the entire funnel, right?

112
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,200
Including upselling cross-selling, after a customer purchase.

113
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,700
Has.

114
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:57,600
So in that case, I do think it makes sense for the customer marketing person to report a dimension Very interesting.

115
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:04,800
Okay, I got another question here and this is all about getting the data, right?

116
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,300
And I think it goes back to what you said about aligning on goals once that's done.

117
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,700
Then, you know, first of all, describe to us why it's important to get the data, right?

118
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:23,100
Like we all kind of know this, but if you could explain the benefits of that, then that would be very helpful.

119
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,800
Then I will, then we're going to ask some other questions I have about data.

120
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,800
So I mean data hygiene is near and dear to my heart.

121
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:36,400
I believe that it is everybody's responsibility who touches the data, to keep it clean to the best of their ability.

122
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,700
It's not just marketing, it's not just sales, right?

123
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:49,400
Think of like your customer success team and everybody else who is interacting with your CRM, you have got to get the whole company aligned that it's everyone's responsible to make sure the data is accurate.

124
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,400
And here's why, right?

125
00:13:50,500 --> 00:14:02,900
Accurate data makes you did, we basically ensure that the B2B marketing efforts are all targeted to the Right individuals, that results in higher response rates, better Roi better customer experience again, right?

126
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,500
And if you have inaccurate data, you're just wasting resources.

127
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,500
You have got a real possible issue of decreasing.

128
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,800
Trust with your customers.

129
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,600
How awful do you feel when you get an email?

130
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,700
That says hi.

131
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,300
And the name is not yours.

132
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,500
You laugh, right?

133
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,900
And those things decrease trust and it also has a negative impact on your brand reputation.

134
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,200
So you have got the huge potential to Look really.

135
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:36,200
It's like or you have got the potential fall on your face or have egg on your flight face and that's a difference between having accurate and inaccurate data, that's good.

136
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:50,600
Okay, I have an another question just around data and where I guess just as far as dashboards like What tools do you use?

137
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:57,700
And what are some of the key metrics based on your goals that you're tracking with as far as data?

138
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,800
So I will tell you what's on my dashboard.

139
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,200
Typically, and again, that depends on the team's marketing, the maturity, right?

140
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:19,000
And not just a marketing team, but the sales level of maturity, but there's some table Stakes insights that you should have, you know, engagement, conversion, rate, and lead generation.

141
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
That's something that I look at constantly.

142
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:28,400
And then, as the team matures, I add things like, you know, Revenue total revenue generated from campaigns.

143
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,600
The cost per acquisition.

144
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:39,700
I also started to look at customer lifetime value is, I think that's, we tend to be a little bit short-sighted in the marketing team.

145
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:46,500
Like let us get the leads in, let us see if it creates five applied, and then we say yes, we success succeeded but that it's way more than that, right?

146
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:52,400
It's really the return on marketing investment and then I would say next the final level, right?

147
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,800
So that if that's more mature, you got to get down to channel performance.

148
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:07,600
That's incredibly important right now because we're all being asked to do more with less right more Pipeline with less money, in the way that you do that is you invest in the channels that are converting the best.

149
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,700
So, definitely I should be something on your dashboard right now.

150
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,500
That's good.

151
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:22,100
Okay, then this goes right into some of the kpis that marketers should be delivering for campaigns, which you might have answered some of those.

152
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:29,600
But for your team, specifically, what are some of the kpis that you're monitoring?

153
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,900
And how frequently do, you monitor them?

154
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,600
So our first kpi is Pipeline and in dollars.

155
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:49,400
So that's the first thing that we look at, and I would like, I know this sounds a little crazy and I don't know if I want to meet this, but how often do I monitor it every hour or two depending on whether or not?

156
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,700
It's a weekend break away.

157
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,100
So, you know, it's my version of obsessively, refreshing, a dashboard and looking at where we are.

158
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,099
So I think that's probably the number one, right?

159
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:08,099
Then we want to see of all of the pipeline that we created from marketing's effort.

160
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,200
What moves through the funnel and what is the conversion rate from?

161
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,599
You know, sales accepted sales qualified and then eventually bookings.

162
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,599
So that's one of the first things that we Monitor, and then we go back.

163
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,800
And we say, what did it cost to get that pipeline that bookings.

164
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:33,600
So you should have some Benchmark right now, for every dollar that you spend that you're going to return x amount to the business and Pipeline and or x amount in bookings.

165
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,500
So we have that, right?

166
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:42,900
That's a benchmark, and we try to always hit it or improve and that helps me make decisions about again where to spend money over to course, correct?

167
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:53,900
So for example, if we're trying to create let us say, $10 a pipeline for every dollar that we spend, if we as see a Channel or a campaign way below that we first asked, like, we do something wrong.

168
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,800
Can we course correct?

169
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
If not is this valuable, do we want to keep spending our time here?

170
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Because it seems like we could be doing better results in another Channel or another campaign that makes sense, as far as frequency of checking the channel performance per Channel, each Channel, obviously from email to LinkedIn, you know, their SEO.

171
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:25,000
There's like completely different timing of when they're successful or not.

172
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,900
So do you have like a sense of how frequently you check certain channels or any advice on that?

173
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:39,300
Yeah so we recheck most channels for what I would call leading indicators immediately, right?

174
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,600
Like activity metrics.

175
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:52,600
If we're going to send an email, or we're going to send a webinar registration, for example, it's fun to actually look at like, you know, let us take a look at how many people registered but registered as an activity metric.

176
00:18:52,900 --> 00:19:02,200
So, I think as you are in mid-flight for a campaign, you should be looking at your leading indicators in real time, right?

177
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,200
And again, that's just so you can course, correct?

178
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:12,700
Because if you put a lot of money and time into creating a webinar, if you're not hitting your registration and goals, you're not going to hit your attendance goals, you're not going to hit your demo request.

179
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,800
You're not going to arise, just going to keep going down and you want to keep that from happening.

180
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,800
So I think you should be looking at all the time.

181
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,800
Hmm.

182
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,700
It's good.

183
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,700
How do you differentiate then tracking those channels versus campaigns?

184
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:36,100
And can you define even the difference of the two and the type of kpi's that you will look at for each?

185
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,400
Oh yeah.

186
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,600
Okay.

187
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:47,400
So, you know, we think of a campaign as a collection of channels Pride that lasts more than, you know, I would say six months, right?

188
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,900
So let us say a campaign last six months, we're going to use multiple.

189
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,900
Almost because we have an off day Channel approach to get everybody through whatever conversion point we have defined.

190
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:10,800
So for example, right now, we are doing our annual state of direct mail campaign, we use email, social pushing, will, use retargeting will use in product advertising, and all of those are different channels.

191
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,500
And then what we do is all of those channels roll up to the campaign.

192
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:22,300
So we use, you know, UTM, basically parameters to make sure that we are tracking The performance of every channel.

193
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,100
So we can say this is the amount of money that we spent on this channel.

194
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Here is what it returns on investment.

195
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,800
And then we roll up all the channels to the campaign and report on that as a whole.

196
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,400
Mmm.

197
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,500
It would you say a good amount of time for a campaign?

198
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,000
Run is about six months.

199
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Yeah, so I know a lot of people differ on this.

200
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:54,600
I have heard anywhere from three months to a year and for us, what we do is we have different levels of like, basically tears of campaigns, We have some that we expect to run six months, maybe a little bit longer.

201
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,400
You know, they have long tails, nine months, and then we have what we have like, short run campaigns, that could be three to four months.

202
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,500
Can you give some distinguishing factors?

203
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,900
Like what would a short-term campaign sound like even messaging?

204
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,400
Why is versus a six-month campaign?

205
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:23,300
Yeah, so I six-month campaign to us would be like a big top of the funnel thought leadership campaign that has a lot of reach.

206
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,400
We have the potential to get a lot of people really high in the funnel.

207
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:33,600
Then we have shorter campaigns that are usually middle of the A funnel and are targeted towards, for example Industries.

208
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:45,600
So there's a smaller subset of people to talk to but higher potential of conversion rate, but we know we're not going to be going on and on about thought leadership, they know who we are, and then we just want to move them down the funnel.

209
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,800
Gotcha.

210
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,300
Okay, it's very helpful.

211
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,200
Okay.

212
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,400
So then my next section here is around connecting demand channels.

213
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,500
What are some of the things to consider when you're connecting the channels?

214
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,200
This is really good question.

215
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,800
So, you know, I let me start here.

216
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,300
I think most folks don't realize that connecting your channels takes way more than technology.

217
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,700
The goal is to create a seamless tracking, right?

218
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,700
Of customer interactions.

219
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,600
Us all the channels for all of the reasons that I talked about earlier.

220
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
We were talking about database Health, right?

221
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:31,700
You want personalization across all channels and that takes way more than technology, by the way, that takes by in, right?

222
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:46,500
So before you even think about integrating tools, before you get to this question about apis, you have to start by talking to your marketing and sales leadership, get them together right and get the no line on what the goals are for your technology, what?

223
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,600
Fields, you're going to use, right?

224
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:58,200
I mean I honestly I had a dollar for every time I have seen sales, pull a report and marketing say that's not the right field, I could have retired already.

225
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,700
Don't use that feel.

226
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,600
That's the line I hear the most.

227
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,300
We're talking about operations.

228
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:19,200
Then also you have to agree like when you're going to track but how you're going to report on it and most importantly, when you're going to review the data, when you're going to go back and actually, Make recommendations to improve it.

229
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:29,900
So that's a that is a lot of consensuses building and I think that is the part that people miss out on Who's responsible for the consensus building?

230
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,600
How does that work on the marketing side to then the other teams?

231
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,300
Yeah.

232
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:46,500
So if you had that magical person who is leading up the marketing operations person, they should be at a level high enough that they can negotiate that conversation, that would be ideal.

233
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,100
What?

234
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,700
I see and I think a lot of companies are moving towards is a revenue office function, right?

235
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,500
That is integrating marketing and sales Ops together.

236
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,500
And then the revenue Ops person is basically the one who holds the keys to the kingdom.

237
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,600
Hmm.

238
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,600
Mmm, gotcha.

239
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:10,200
So they would be responsible to provide the direction the Insight recommendations on which channels to connect and why.

240
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:26,800
Yeah I mean and I would say specifically they have got to get everybody who is responsible for operations, not just marketing but sales to and leaders who own targets by blind and bookings into a room together and understand what the goal is and then come up with reporting.

241
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,900
That works for both teams.

242
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,400
Hmm.

243
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,100
Okay.

244
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,500
So I want to dig into this.

245
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Have you seen examples where it's not happening consensus isn't happening?

246
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:47,800
What are what does that look like when it's not happening and what are the outcomes versus when it is happening?

247
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,700
And I like to hear some of the attributes of that.

248
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,700
But first, it's like what are the attributes of?

249
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,300
It's not working.

250
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:08,900
So here's what you will hear, what it's not working marking will say, you know, we generated X percentage of the pipeline, this last quarter and you're inside sales team, and your sales people will do this.

251
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,800
No, you did.

252
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:25,100
That's when you know, it's not working that or, you know, we see these conversion rates, and they say, no, that's not what, that's not how it feels, right?

253
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,100
It's all those numbers that nobody Buys in, you know, across the organization.

254
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:45,100
That's when, you know, it's not working when it's working, is when you get a lot of head nodding, and you say, okay, we all agreed that we were going to use this logic to pull marketing's attribution.

255
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:56,800
Whatever it is whatever your look back model is whether it is a multi attribution multi-touch, we agreed going in and since we agreed on that, this is the number that it is turning out.

256
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,100
And now that we have all agreed that this is the right number.

257
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,400
What do we do to get better?

258
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,300
That's what it looks like when it's right.

259
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Ah, I feel like not a lot of orgs, especially when you get into, you know, series a series be right?

260
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:24,500
You may not have time to be able to do this, you may not have resources so in a limited resource, type budget, constraint environment.

261
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,000
How do we build consensus right away?

262
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,700
Well, that is very true, right?

263
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:41,100
Most startups are starting their really far behind on this, right?

264
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,000
And if you can't do multi-touch attribution, at least agree on a single touch, right?

265
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,700
Let us start there, what is the most accurate?

266
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:57,900
Single touch that we can all pinpoint to giving some kind of credit for where the of the pipeline is created.

267
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:07,800
And by the way, you know, I use the word credit because that's what people understand, but the goal isn't really to give one team over another credit is if you're out what's working versus what it isn't.

268
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,100
Right, that's what we want to do, so we can do again more of what's working.

269
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:18,400
So, I think if you can even just get consensus on a single point of attribution, it goes a long way.

270
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,700
That's great advice.

271
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:30,600
All right, adding data intelligence, what are some ways you can enrich your database?

272
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,400
Oh, others.

273
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,100
So there's lots of ways, but before you reach your database, right?

274
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:49,000
First you, start by cleaning it because really were talking about is data intelligence and you get a lot of data intelligence just by removing duplicates, correcting errors, just analyzing data, all of that stuff.

275
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,200
So that should be step one.

276
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,800
Then you look at what systems you have that you can pull data from, right?

277
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,700
Do you have any kind of predictive intense software?

278
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:05,600
So we do we use he's like sixth sense to determine whether or not it.

279
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,700
We're seeing buying signals, right?

280
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,500
That's a way to enrich your database.

281
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:19,500
Do you have any kind of real time data streams, like, your website analytics that you can pull on to gain a more comprehensive understanding of your customer behavior?

282
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:29,000
And then like, basically what other systems do you have already that you can integrate your CRM or Erp, anything else that is a single source of Truth.

283
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
All of those should come in to enrich your data.

284
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:45,000
So, yeah, there's lots of things that you can pull that a lot of companies, even startups have internal processes that have in back for collecting and valuable data that just aren't pulled into fields that we can use and getting them in.

285
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,900
There is very helpful.

286
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,800
That's great.

287
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:56,300
If anybody has questions for Julie, feel free to drop them in the Q&A tab as or going as well.

288
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,800
Okay?

289
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,100
And when you're talking about cleansing and enriching the data, who do you generally partner with to do so?

290
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,200
So if you're asking like a vendor, there are multiple data providers that you can try, right?

291
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,900
So, you know, I think one of the more popular ones is zoom info, but I know seamless AI.

292
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,300
There's a ton that are on the market right now so the goal is to do a test right?

293
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:30,200
I always say do it accuracy test before you partner with any vendor and see you know ask them what their expectations is for leave quality.

294
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,100
So you know we use zoom info.

295
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:43,100
I was pretty happy with it but then there's all are Our inside sales, folks are always updating data in real time when they're interacting with Buyers, or they're out on LinkedIn as well.

296
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,400
Gotcha.

297
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,600
Okay.

298
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,100
Mark Tech Integrations.

299
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
All right.

300
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:04,300
In addition to your CRM and marketing automation platform, what are other integration points marketers should consider Oh boy.

301
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,200
Okay, so there is a there's a ton the depending on whether your B2B or b2c.

302
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,300
Let us say we have our analytics in our data management, platforms attached.

303
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,500
So if you have any kind of data visualization or business intelligence tools, you might want to connect those.

304
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,300
If you were B to C your Ecommerce platform, of course, right?

305
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:37,200
And then there's some other ones that I would say, our state table Stakes, like your social media management, let us see your advertising and paid media, you connect, those one of the ones that People don't think about is that you could Connect customer feedback and surveys.

306
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:37,900
All right?

307
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:44,800
So you could be actually, for example, measuring customer feedback and measuring customer satisfaction it.

308
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,600
Real time off your website, then, connecting that feedback back to your database.

309
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:58,800
And then when you realize that somebody has a positive net promoter score, those are the folks that you go after for the positive reviews on your, you know, software review sites.

310
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,100
For example, So, yeah.

311
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,500
And then, you know, the other thing, I web personalization, right?

312
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:14,900
If you want to have an intelligent conversation online with your key accounts, you have got to make sure that your database is what I clean that everything's connected.

313
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:25,800
Can I ask what tools you're currently using for web personalization, and like, certain things that are you're connecting?

314
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,700
What are tools that you're using today?

315
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,800
So we're actually the evaluation process for Mutiny HQ for our website personalization.

316
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,200
Nice?

317
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,600
Yeah, yeah.

318
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,200
And we want when we want to use it as part of basically are a b x approach.

319
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,600
So, you know, we want to make sure that when somebody from we can identify, when someone comes from one of our key accounts, and we can give them a personalized experience.

320
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:51,700
So, yeah.

321
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,500
So that's our next step back in maturity.

322
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:14,300
So, thinking about that customer life cycle again, and the different tools that you plug in play across the customer life cycle, if you're just start from that initial top of funnel experience and that could be a mutiny personalization experience with your web pages, all the way through.

323
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:23,600
Could you just give us very Typically, what are some of the tools that you're currently deploying and using across the customer life cycle.

324
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,300
Yeah.

325
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:33,300
So we use sixth sense to at the very top of the funnel to look for buying signals.

326
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,300
And we will from there, we put them in different programs, right?

327
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,700
So it could be retargeting ads, we might actually put them into email campaigns.

328
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:55,900
We use Marketo for email, we use Salesforce for our CRM, and we have the added bonus of being able to use Direct Mail, Right since we're a drachma automation platform.

329
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,200
So we use our own software for middle of the funnel conversion.

330
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,200
So we have an integration.

331
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:16,000
Even with a data provider that integrates a pixel on to our web pages to identify individuals, not just accounts and matches them with their home address.

332
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:24,700
So that allows us to basically trigger a postcard to any person who is an anonymous web videos that are two are high value pages.

333
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,100
So that's a really fun integration Point.

334
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,200
I have never got to do anywhere else.

335
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:38,400
I have worked How exciting and then how does that just continuing on that customer lifecycle with once, they're converted as a customer?

336
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,700
What kind of tools do you use their own after a?

337
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,200
So that's where it gets a little bit out of my purview in my organization here.

338
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:58,600
So, you know, we at that point, they actually convert to like, basic that our account management side, and then we think of them as a potential for a new business, right?

339
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,400
So then they go back to the top of our funnel.

340
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,700
Well, and we look at our large customers, and we say, where can we sell at a different business unit?

341
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,800
And we start from the very beginning again, right?

342
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:13,600
We say, where do we see interest, and we start the whole process to try to get another business unit down the funnel, That's great.

343
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,400
Thank you for walking us through each of those.

344
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:22,699
I think that's really helpful for some of us to hear and compare back to the Sixth Sense top of funnel.

345
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:39,000
And when you're looking at intent, what are some of the key signals that indicate low, medium, high intent, Yeah, so we look at both branded searches and unbranded searches.

346
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:48,100
So you know if somebody is looking, for example, lobs Direct Mail software versus film, The competitor named, that would be a high intent, right?

347
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:53,000
They look like they are in the part where they're looking to narrow down the vendors.

348
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:58,000
They try to figure out whether or not they have a problem with a solution is that's a really good indication.

349
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,500
Right?

350
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,200
Versus let us say someone who says what is direct mail or what is direct?

351
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:13,100
An automation there are a lot higher up, and they're going to need some of our educational thought leadership of why direct mails important, how it works as a marketing channel, but they can expect to see for the ROI.

352
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,700
So you get a lot, you can learn a lot from that from just looking at that.

353
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,300
And also you know it's very interesting.

354
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:31,900
One of the things that we're going to be integrating very soon on our website is a search functionality that gives us real time feedback about what people are searching on our website for the same reason, right?

355
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:37,300
We want to understand What people are looking for to get the solutions that they need, right?

356
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,600
And that will also help us figure out where they are in the funnel when they get to our site.

357
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
That's so good.

358
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:52,100
Have has lob thought about using a chatbot, something like drift or qualified ever and maybe you do already, we do.

359
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,300
Yeah.

360
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,000
We use intercom right now.

361
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,600
Gotcha.

362
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,300
Yeah.

363
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,000
So it is, it is a chatbot, although we kind of have a hybrid model.

364
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,600
We have our inside sales folks, moderate sometimes.

365
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,300
And then the chat pod when it's off hours, Yeah.

366
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,300
Great.

367
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:17,500
Wow, so rich, I love how you're taking us from high-level 30,000 feet strategy and getting right into the tactics Julie, it's really great.

368
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:30,000
You know, I am as we're thinking about our B2B community and just the whole Community is rocked right now.

369
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:51,200
And you, and I have talked about this even outside this event of like, wow, it's just such a time of like you said, being able to Each your time and your resources with, you know, you're doing a lot more with less and there's burn out right now and there's, you know, this sense of insecurity or instability.

370
00:36:51,200 --> 00:37:01,400
And so, do you have any words of advice or even encouragement for your fellow B2B marketers today?

371
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,500
Yeah, I mean, I am I am feeling it.

372
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,700
We're all feeling it.

373
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
I can't even go on.

374
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,500
Until the LinkedIn anymore because it feels like Doomsday scrolling right now.

375
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,000
I understand, you know.

376
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,100
So I guess first is the first thing is this too shall pass, right?

377
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,400
I have been doing this a very long time and I know what is unique about.

378
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:34,000
This is that we just have come off a 10-year Bull, Run of Technology, being almost impervious to all of the issues with recession and everything, right?

379
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,100
So it's the first time I have had a lot of people in the workplace have gone.

380
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,900
This, but it isn't for me, right?

381
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,100
I remember the.com bust and lots of marketing.

382
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,600
People went through it back then and we were covered.

383
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:59,100
So I would say right now, here's what I am very much focused on understand your Tamil performance so you can show the value of what you're the value of Pipeline and in bookings of every dollar that you're spending.

384
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:13,200
That's number one, the two is, make sure you are facilitating conversations with the entire Breyer groups rather than just the Decision makers that you have identified because of layoffs and job hopping.

385
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,900
Those people move very, very quickly.

386
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,300
So make sure that you are multi threaded into opportunities.

387
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,300
You know, I am very interesting change that.

388
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,500
I see a lot of marketers make right now, is that there used to be this idea of?

389
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,800
Once you open an opportunity its hands off, right marketing, can't touch it.

390
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,500
Now, it's in the sales horn.

391
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:40,400
And now what we're moving towards is once the opportunity is open now we account warm, right?

392
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:52,400
You have to go back in and get as many different tethers you can into that buying unit because we lose people so quickly now and that's a big shift that people are making and that's probably the best word.

393
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,000
I second I can share right now.

394
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,900
