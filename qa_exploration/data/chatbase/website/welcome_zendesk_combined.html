</ul><h1>Hubspot Integration Documentation</h1>
<h1 class="p1">Overview</h1>
<p class="p2">Welcome’s Hubspot integration enables our customers to use the actions a Contact takes in Welcome to inform the next step of that Contact’s buyer’s journey.<br><br>The integration is streamlined to require minimal configuration. It makes it so your Hubspot Contacts need only click a link to get into an event, without going through registration. It sends back clear, easy-to-interpret signals of attendee sentiment, in real-time, for follow-up action. Some examples of things you can do with the Welcome integration are:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Signal an Account Executive in real time when their prospect is attending one of your Webinars, or when a qualified account engages with a “Do you want to talk to a Salesperson?” Poll<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</li>

<p class="p2">When someone registers for your Welcome event, this integration will update their Hubspot Contact with the properties you have configured in the field mapper during integration set up.

<h1 class="p1">How do I send registrants into Welcome from Hubspot</h1>
<p>To send Contacts into Welcome such that they don’t need to register again, we recommend using our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415386814996-Quick-Registration-Guide"><span class="s2">Quick Registration link functionality</span></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alternatively, you can create a Hubspot workflow to send registrants into Welcome, populate a Unique Link Property on each registrant’s Contact Object, and use that property your pre-event communications. To do so, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol class="ol2">
<li class="li2">Navigate to your Organization Integration settings. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> <img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/12466367304980" alt="mceclip29.png"></span>

<li class="li2">Otherwise, create a Contact property in Hubspot for the Unique Link and select that property in the field mapper<span class="Apple-converted-space" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"> <img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/12466392193556" alt="mceclip32.png"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/12466423532436" alt="mceclip33.png"></span>

<p class="p3"> </p><h1>Unable to Screen Share</h1>
<p>Screen sharing in the virtual space is extremely important and very common. It also happens to be one of the most common troubleshooting issues with web based platforms. This issue is most commonly associated to Mac users. If a Mac user has never screen shared with a web browser before. The device system settings most likely hasn't given the browser app permissions to do so. Fortunately, this is an easy fix.</p>
<h2 id="01GQ5GAKX87SCN131VSMN7NMR6">What does the error look like</h2>
<p>How you'll know if you are getting blocked by the system while in Welcome. You will receive a red pop up at the top right corner of the screen.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/12492780622612" alt="mceclip0.png"></p>
<h2 id="01GQ5GAKX9T2RHDM16D93V8XTD">How do we fix this</h2>
<p>Let's walkthrough how to enable these permissions. This is most commonly associated with Mac devices. Windows devices very rarely have this permission blocked out of the box. </p>
<p>An important thing to note is that some updates to your browser or system can inadvertently reset permissions even if it looks like the box has already been checked. In these cases, please remove the permissions, re-add them, and then restart your browser. </p>

<li>Go to Security and Privacy settings (Press CMD+ Space bar and type Security)</li>
<li>Click the Privacy tab on the right</li>
<li>On the left side bar scroll until you find Screen Recording</li>
<li>Check the box for Google Chrome on the right for each section
<ol>
<li>You may need to use the padlock at the bottom left to allow checking the box</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You will be prompted to restart Chrome if it is currently open</li>
<li>Go back to the event and jump in</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="01GQ5GAKX9PG33RDN5FB29P3W0">Windows System Settings</h3>
<p>Windows does not have a system setting for this specifically. If you are getting blocked it is most likely from some sort of security app denying the browser from screen sharing. You will either need to disable the app, allow the permission from within the app, and/or contact your IT team that manages permissions for you.</p>

<h1 id="01GR6X061098A0W8G6WB3HKT36" class="p1">Overview</h1>
<p class="p2">Welcome’s Marketo integration enables our customers to use the actions a Lead takes in Welcome to inform the next step of that Lead's buyer’s journey.<br><br>The integration is streamlined to require minimal configuration. It makes it so your Marketo Program Members need only click a link to get into an event, without going through registration. It sends back clear, easy-to-interpret signals of attendee sentiment, in real-time, for follow-up action.</p>
<p class="p2">Some examples of things you can do with the Welcome integration are:</p>
<p>Signal the Sales Owner in real-time when their prospect engages with a “Do you want to talk to a Salesperson?” Poll<span class="Apple-converted-space"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/12895352138260" alt="Signal_sales_owner_zoomed.png"> <img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/12895467706388" alt="send_alert_zoomed.png"></span></p>

<h1 id="01GR6X0611N26HEE14N7TEEJ87" class="p1">How do I send registrants into Welcome from Marketo</h1>
<p><em><strong>To send Program Members into Welcome such that they don’t need to register again, we recommend using our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415386814996-Quick-Registration-Guide"><span class="s2">Quick Registration link functionality</span></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></strong></em></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can create a Marketo Flow to send registrants into Welcome (after they sign up on a Marketo Registration form for instance), populate a Unique Link Property on each registrant’s Contact Object, and use that property your pre-event communications. This more complex workflow is made obsolete by Welcome's Quick Registration Functionality linked above, but you may reach out to Welcome Support if you are looking to implement it.</p>

<h4 id="01FZ0WRAB46E8HYR8SJ6069169"><strong>Computer for the best experience</strong></h4>
<p>Tablets and mobile are now supported but will have limited features. Most notably you will have access to Public Chat, Polls, and Q&amp;A. More information can be found <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055728552-Mobile-Safari-Experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
<h4 id="01FZ0WRCVTJR2C4SEQW5EA0HJ2"><strong>Browsers</strong></h4>
<p>Welcome functions with most browsers. For the best experience, we recommend using Chrome. More information regarding Safari and Mobile can be found <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055728552-Mobile-Safari-Experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
<p>Tip: Make sure the browser you are using is updated.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">Chrome</a></li>
<li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-release">Firefox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?&amp;OCID=AID2001283_SEM">Edge</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Tip: If you have any issues or blips one of the first things to do is to refresh your browser. This will resolve a large portion of issues.</p>
<p>Tip: For multi-day events, you are speaking in please make sure you refresh your browser between days. <strong>The video feed token generated in the browser has a 24hr duration. Simply refreshing your browser will generate a new one</strong>.</p>
<p id="01FZ0WQYQ2D0TR5KQJG6KNMAAM">Tip: <strong>Keep only one instance of Welcome open. </strong>If you happen to open another tab/window of the event your previous instance will look like the image below. If you happen to see this and did not open a new tab/window. Someone is logging into the event with your profile elsewhere. This normally happens if you have shared your 1 click link with someone else.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/11002610428436" alt="mceclip0.png"></p>
<h4 id="01FZ0WRNBK6B9W36WCT6WAR5HX"><strong>Close other program &amp; browser tabs</strong></h4>
<p>If you are a producer or speaker you should minimize the amount of tabs, windows, and non-essential programs to save processing power and bandwidth. Chrome can be memory intensive the more tabs and windows you have open.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong>Good 🙂</strong><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360075230672/Untitled__3_.png" alt="Untitled__3_.png" width="731" height="52"></p>

<h4 id="01FZ0WRRK3J4DNVMKVVBM7QB01"><strong>Optimize your browser window</strong></h4>
<p>Smaller or minimized screens might block buttons and controls. If you are unable to have the window in a large format. Adjust the browser zoom to change the scaling within the browser.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong>Good 🙂</strong></p>

<h4 id="01FZ0WS1680W0DE5Z5W1ZXRMRK"><strong>System Permissions</strong></h4>
<p>If you are a speaker or producer and plan on screen sharing (either on the main stage or in a breakout room/lounge) we strongly recommend using Chrome. Firefox also allows for screen sharing, but the user experience is not as straightforward.</p>
<p>If you are using a Mac device and have never screen shared on Chrome you will likely have to enable your system settings for screen recordings. Please review our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058944832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Troubleshooting Permission Issues</a> article.</p>

<h4 id="01FZ0WS4K9F1FAKANP9YXVXEXA"><strong>Browser Permissions</strong></h4>
<p>The most common issues with Mic and Audio are the privacy/security permissions within the browser settings. You can view our article regarding <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058944832" target="_self">Troubleshooting Browser Permissions</a> for further details. If you are on a Mac device and you receive an error "Permission denied by system" that is due to your devices system settings needing to be enabled which is also covered in the article linked above.</p>

<h4 id="01FZ0WSCDGYEQFEST6N7H95M2R"><strong>VPNs, Firewalls, and/or Other IT Security</strong></h4>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You may encounter issues viewing audio/video within Welcome depending on the levels of IT security you have on your machine (e.g. a work computer) and/or your network connection (e.g. working at the office). In many cases, simply disabling the software blocking it will fix this issue.</p>
<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Make sure to run the <a href="https://app.experiencewelcome.com/compatibility-check" target="_self">compatibility checker</a> to catch issues before the event.</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You may need to contact your IT department to allow Welcome.

<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If you are only joining the event as an attendee (not a speaker/presenter or a producer) you can also join via mobile/tablet if you're unable to rectify the connection issue.

<h4 id="01FZ0WSGHPDW65KS96DC01C5S1"><strong>Internet Speed</strong></h4>
<p>Connection speed is more important for producers and speakers. Uploading and downloading video feeds requires a fast internet connection. We recommend <strong>50Mbps download</strong> and <strong>25Mbps upload</strong> as a minimum. We also highly recommend using a <strong>wired ethernet connection</strong> if possible as wi-fi can be spotty depending on the router being used. If you are on an unstable wifi connection, restarting your router/modem can help. You can test your internet speeds <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=speed+test&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS866US866&amp;oq=speed+test&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l3j46l3j69i60.1025j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></strong>. </p>

<h4 id="01FZ0WSN0XVND655DXXKY6CH5M"><strong>Try an Incognito/Private window</strong></h4>
<p>Sometimes third-party browser extensions might interfere with Welcome. Try an Incognito/Private window if you aren't able to turn those off.</p>
<h4 id="01FZ0WSQJXJWD3XZAMFY55AE39"><strong>Browser refresh</strong></h4>
<p>Sometimes updates to the browser will require a refresh. 🙂</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tip: Hold Shift command+R (Mac) or Shift Ctrl+R (Windows) to reload the page without the cache.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="01FZ0WSTCMTSQM8JMHM1MZ7D2R"><strong>Computer restart</strong></h4>
<p>If you're still having trouble give your computer a hard restart.</p>

<h1 id="h_01EZ5E8TX621C1EQJFZX3JBBRD">Creating Your First Event</h1>
<p>Creating your event is pretty straight forward. In your Organizational Dashboard you will have 2 areas where to create your event. You should see "Create one now" in the center of the screen and a blue "Create New Event" button at the top right. A pop up will appear and ask for some very basic information. Confirm your choices and you will be launched into the Control Room to start building out your event.</p>
<h1 id="h_01FBW9G1KHP85B43XHK05VZSBK">Event Dashboard</h1>
<p>This is your "backend" administration page. You will spend most of your time here fine-tuning areas such as the time of the event, managing attendees, uploading assets, video recordings, and data.

<p>We have many features that bring value and elevate the experience from just a stage on the screen to something jaw-dropping. </p>
<h2 id="h_01FBW9H080N3H8E4VBQ1B5E48S" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Breakout Rooms and Lounges</h2>
<p>We have two secondary spaces to drive engagement with the attendees in a much smaller intimate space. Breakouts are our small private groups that are curated by the producer. Attendees will have to be invited by the producer to join these groups. Lounges are more of a public small group that any attendee can jump in and out of at anytime the room is open. We have detailed guides for each <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056785931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breakout Room Guide</a> and <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058706352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lounge Guide</a>. Please read both for specifics.</p>
<p><strong>Breakout rooms vs Lounges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both can have between 2-16 people but, Lounges have spaces we call Watchers that allow attendees to jump into the room and not be on camera. Watchers are still able to chat with the other participants in the Lounge.</li>
<li>Users will need their camera and mic on and working to be able to use them (not applicable to Watchers in Lounges).</li>
<li>Both options have the capability to enable photo booths.</li>
<li>From the attendee's perspective, when inside the rooms they look identical. As a producer, the administration panels for each are different.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01FBW9H875VQZ9WPAA4ETCAR1Z" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Q&amp;A</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Our Q&amp;A feature is one of our attendee engagement tools that allow attendees to ask questions directly to the speakers publicly. These questions can be up-voted or down-voted by other attendees to give the producer a sense of what is the most popular. Check out our detailed <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058913271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Q&amp;A Guide</a> for specifics.</p>
<h2 id="h_01FBW9HH2YJ05PW8NZMZZJSGYG" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Polls</h2>

This way you can still have a close personal interaction with your new friend and commentate on what is being said on stage.

<h1 id="h_01FC42SYVRHNV3Y25244B9YMGP">Onboarding Speakers</h1>
<p>Properly onboarding your speakers prior to the event is critical for a smooth event. Our guide below will answer various questions from the speakers, troubleshoot technical issues, set expectations for both parties, and increase your familiarity with the platform. If you are to have issues, having them appear and resolved during the onboarding sessions is ideal compared to two minutes before the speakers need to be on stage. We have a detailed <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052720251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaker Onboarding Guide</a> for specifics.</p>
<h1 id="h_01FM02M5RQG5A1EBMRV6WDZ0RN">Event Preparation</h1>
<p>Preparing for your event is extremely critical to having a smooth event. Setting up the timeline of tasks to complete prior to game day is crucial. A list of a few things to put together during this time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production Milestones</li>
<li>Communication Plans</li>
<li>Run of Show</li>
<li>Speaker List</li>
<li>Attendee List</li>
<li>Content Creation</li>
<li>Onboarding for all those involved</li>
<li>Technical runs</li>
<li>Dry runs</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="h_01FM02MDZN2FVRFPVNS00JNX68">Day of the Event</h1>
<p>Time for the big show! Make sure you get some good sleep and prepare some coffee, water, and snacks nearby. If you have planned and prepared accordingly the stress of this day will be slightly lower. Technical blips, user errors, speakers arriving late, and unforeseeable issues can always show up. It is best to stay cool, calm, and collected to work on the issues. For technical issues that you are unable to solve click on your profile image at the top right of the screen and click contact support to send an SOS. You are also welcome to email <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a>. </p>
<h1 id="h_01FM02MK1G4QE9XJN5ED3EG5TD">Post Event Debrief</h1>
<p>The event is over and now you can take a breath and step away for a quick five. Now that you are back at your computer it's time to review the wins, losses, post-event strategies, and review the data. Our data will not fully propagate for about 90 mins post-event time. Check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408099160084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytics Guide</a> for greater specifics.

<h3><strong>Lounge &amp; Breakout Rooms</strong></h3>
<p>These rooms have been getting some fresh paint! Here are a few upgrades to keep in mind when planning your next event:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Room limit increased.</strong> Lounge and breakout rooms now support up to SIXTEEN people. Woot!</li>
<li>
<strong>Screenshare.</strong> Producers &amp; Speakers can now share their screens in these rooms. So if you need to facilitate a discussion, go ahead and present those fancy slides!</li>
<li>
<strong>Lounge room customization.</strong> Whether it's a sponsored room or a themed happy hour you can now add a logo, a brand color, a call-to-action button, and custom photobooth templates to lounge rooms.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Domain Switch</strong></h3>
<p>As part of some housecleaning we're switching our app domain name from <a href="http://app.welcomeonline.co/">app.welcomeonline.co</a> to <a href="http://app.experiencewelcome.com/">app.experiencewelcome.com</a>, this will take effect on October 29th. Any previous links will still work for the next 6 months. For any future invitations, just use the new link. Also please make sure to whitelist emails coming from the <a href="http://experiencewelcome.com/">experiencewelcome.com</a> domain so you and your attendees never miss an email.</p>
<h3><strong>Compatibility Checker</strong></h3>
<p>Running kick-ass events from a web browser is no easy feat! VPNs, browsers, and connection speeds all play a role. So to make sure your speakers, attendees, and Oprah can shine on Welcome we've built a quick compatibility checker. <strong><a href="https://app.welcomeonline.co/compatibility-check">Please give it a try</a></strong> and include it in your event communications!</p>
<h3><strong>Recording</strong></h3>
<p>We've increased performance to make recordings a bit more reliable! Just remember to click <strong>Start Recording</strong> at the start time of your event. ;)</p>
<h3><strong>Disable &amp; Enable Chat</strong></h3>
<p>You can now toggle on or off any part of chat (i.e. Q&amp;A, Help, etc) at any moment within you event.</p><h1>General Guide</h1>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Nothing is more important than the attendees' experience of an event. The Welcome platform was designed with the attendee in mind. We created a platform that allows for an immersive experience by creating tools that will allow the event producers and speakers to engage with the audience beyond just being a talking heads. Attendees can join through desktop on Chrome (our recommendation), Firefox, Edge, Safari, or via mobile (mobile users will not be able to join anything that requires a camera and mic; Breakouts, Lounges, and the GR/stage).</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Use the compatibility checker before logging in to identify any possible issues: <a href="https://app.experiencewelcome.com/compatibility-check">https://app.experiencewelcome.com/compatibility-check</a>
</li>
<li>We strongly recommend using Chrome for all speakers. Please ensure you have your browser permissions for video and microphone allowed; if you plan on screen sharing on a Mac please make sure your system preferences are set correctly (detailed below). You can also use Firefox, Safari, or Edge if you want, but we recommend Chrome.
<ul>
<li>If on a Mac, you will need to check privacy/security settings to allow screen recording for Chrome.
<ul>
<li>Go to System Preferences &gt;Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Scroll down to Screen Recording &gt; Check box for Google Chrome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our full <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058944832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">permissions troubleshooting article</a> is available for further details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Do not</strong> share your unique link with anyone else. If some one does use your unique link it will kick you out of the event due to only 1 unique user can be online with your profile.</li>
<li>If you are screen sharing a 4k display may need to scale your resolution down to 1080p for the event.</li>
<li>Make sure your internet connection is good and stable; we recommend at least 50Mbps download and 25Mbps upload.</li>
<li>Make sure your laptop is plugged in and in a charging state.</li>
<li>Close all of your non-essential programs and limit the number of browser tabs you have open; we recommend just having the Welcome tab open if possible.</li>
<li>Turn off your auto-updating apps, notifications on your device.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="01GE2E3TQYHDESJ9CB7V9KV6CN"><strong>Setting up your environment</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Let your colleagues (or your kids and your dog) know that you are presenting live to 5000+ people and best not disturb you. Maybe lock the door! ;-)</li>
<li>If you are going to be screen sharing, please set up your slides on a second monitor if possible as this will allow you to see both Welcome and your presentation.
<ul>
<li>Check out <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053424631-Screensharing-Presentations-2-screens-">this article</a> if you need more help with screen sharing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure to hide anything personal or sensitive on any screen, tab, desktop, bookmarks bar, and turn off notifications. Lets not forget to silence your mobile devices.</li>
<li>Remember that you will not have the option of using a virtual background unless you use a 3rd party app (Snapcam or mmhmm for instance). You may want to put in some time and energy to make your background look amazing!</li>

<h2 id="01GE2E3TQY7RK02479F1BJTPHV"><strong>Using Welcome</strong></h2>
<p>Here is a video walkthrough of joining an event as a speaker. This should give you a general idea of the experience.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/bad72eca2b8a424e80e48704f9cfa129" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2 id="h_01EW0JSX7M4QKAJ2BGBZQHB358"><strong>Registration</strong></h2>
<p><strong>We recommend using one of the integrated email registration options (Google, LinkedIn, Outlook) if possible.</strong></p>
<p>Registering as a speaker is the same as registering as an attendee. The event producer will give you "Speaker" permissions. You will be given a title within your profile based on the event settings. Attendees do not have a badge here, so as long as you are seeing a title you're good to go as a "Speaker" (note that event staff/producers will also have a title).</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360075401452/Untitled.png" alt="Untitled.png" width="174" height="270"></p>
<h2 id="h_01EW0JTGY5ZGWNYY3BPENGAV55"><strong>Entering an Event</strong></h2>
<p>Unlike attendees, speakers can enter whenever they want. This is so that you can enter the event early and get ready before the show. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You will also see this prompt when you enter an event (attendees don't see any prompt)</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360075401572/Untitled__3_.png" alt="Untitled__3_.png" width="475" height="360"></p>
<h2 id="h_01EW0JV1HVG8BEVDQZC03CR76C"><strong>The Chat Tab</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Public Chat - Where you can interact with other attendees and engage with the speakers
<ul>
<li>Don't forget to use emojis and /giphy [text] to create some fun</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402949454996/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png" width="256" height="153"></p>
<ul>
<li>Speaker Chat - AKA backstage chat, this is only available to speakers and producers of the event. This will allow you to communicate with the staff while you are in and out of the Green Room. </li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9685398213396/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png" width="238" height="255"></p>
<ul>
<li>DMs (Direct Messages) - Allow you to send other attendees DMs for private conversations.
<ul>
<li>You can also request 1:1 video calls with other attendees. For greater detail check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403375948948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1:1 Call Guide</a>

<ul>
<li>Help Chat - Think of this as reaching out to the event staff/producers directly for help with technical issues during the event. You can also review the section of our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360012946272-Troubleshooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help center</a>.
<ul>
<li>You can also click on your profile image at the top right-hand corner and click "Contact Support" to email our team directly. </li>

<h2 id="h_01EW0JVYW2Z1Z99GHWY06B71P7"><strong>The People Tab</strong></h2>
<p>You will be sorted in with the "Speakers." This will allow you to locate the event producers. From this tab, you will also be able to start a Direct Message or <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403375948948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1:1 video call</a> to a person by hovering over the name and clicking the associated button on the right side. If needed, you can also search for a user with the magnifying glass (helpful in large events).</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4403375910804/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png" width="227" height="272"></p>
<h2 id="h_01EW0JWFSDAFPDGH8DN7S0997B"><strong>Entering the Green Room</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/0cf1c7592a264d8886668d4426b24627" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></strong></p>
<p>The Green Room is essentially a backstage for the event. To enter the Green Room you will need to be invited by an event producer. If you need to contact the producers and are not in the green room, the best way to do that is to use the Speaker chat in the communication panel on the right.</p>
<p>When the Producer is ready, you will receive an invite like the one below.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4404208741012/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">After you click "<strong>Accept Invite"</strong>, you will have a prompt to perform a Camera and Microphone check. If you do not see an option to choose your camera and mic. It is likely due to your browser permission setting. In most cases, your browser will give you a pop-up asking you to Allow or Block these settings. If not you will need to go and change them manually. You can follow our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058944832" target="_self">Troubleshooting Permission Issues</a> article for further details.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360091745251/browser_permissions.gif" alt="browser_permissions.gif" width="474" height="195"></p>
<p>Once you have clicked "<strong>Let's Go"</strong>, you will now be in the green room and will be able to speak to the producer and other speakers. The producer will do some sound and video checks with you to ensure the quality is good and prepare you to go on stage.</p>
<h3 id="01GE2E3TQYXK77QVPA4Z1WGB9K">Audio Sliders</h3>
<p>You will have two audio sliders that you can adjust for your needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage Audio Slider at the bottom left. This will allow you to adjust the volume for the stage for your instance only (this does not impact other users).</li>
<li>Green Room Audio Slider at the top to the right of "Green Room". This will allow you to adjust the volume of the Green Room independently from the Stage.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are on stage the Green Room audio will go to <strong>ZERO</strong>. This way the chatter going on in the Green Room does not distract you or leak onto the stage. You are still able to turn it up if you like, but having both audio channels turned up can be distracting while speaking and depending on your set up it may cause Green Room audio to leak onto the stage.</p>
<h2 id="h_01EWGXGBRV844TWZSEQXFGFAV7"><strong>Screen Sharing</strong></h2>
<p><strong>If you are going to be screen sharing AKA "Presenting" please read over these tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Screen share works the best with <strong>Chrome and only a computer (desktop/laptop)</strong>. You can use Firefox as well, but the experience is not as smooth.</li>
<li>If you are screen sharing a 4k display you may need to scale down your resolution 1080p for the event. Or you may need to adjust the window you are sharing accordingly.</li>
<li>For the best experience screen sharing on Welcome, use a second monitor so you can see both your slides on one screen and the Welcome Platform on the other. If you are using PowerPoint, be sure you use slide show mode so that Welcome screen shares the entire presentation from your second monitor. If you are using Keynote with a second monitor, you can avoid the presenter view by playing your slideshow using the "Play Slideshow in Window" setting in the Play tab.<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053529731" target="_self">Screensharing Presentations (1 screen)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053424631" target="_self">Screensharing Presentations (2 screens)</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When generating slides for the event be mindful that the speaker bubbles will be on the bottom left corner of the screen. You will want to design your slides around that so the bubble does not cover content. This is a presentation template you can base your designs around <a class="ssc-anchor-5cc4402e scc-c-btn-bbfcb644 scc-c-btn--anchor-bbfcb644" tabindex="0" href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360088872991/bubble_size_for_presentations.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bubble size for presentations.pptx</a></p>

</li>
<li>If you are seeing a black/blank screen on the Welcome Platform it is most likely due to a VPN and/or network firewall, please turn that off if possible. If you are unable to turn that off please reference our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405168567956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Networking — troubleshooting &amp; tuning for optimal performance </a>article for your IT/Security team. You can also reach out to our support team at <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> if you need further assistance.</li>
<li>If on a Mac, you will need to check system privacy/security settings to allow screen recording for Chrome. In some cases, you will need to do this for your Camera and Microphone as well.
<ul>
<li>Go to System Preferences &gt;Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Scroll down to Screen Recording &gt; Check box for Google Chrome. The Camera and Microphone are listed as such in this section as well. <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058944832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Troubleshooting Permission Issues</a> guide for deeper details.<br><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360085640431/Untitled_design.gif" alt="Untitled_design.gif" width="599" height="337">

<h2 id="01GE2E3TQYS2BXDJ4M5HV7KBQZ"><strong>Event Navigation</strong></h2>
<p>If you are speaking at a multi-track event you may need to move from track to track we have two options for you. These navigation methods <strong>are not</strong> available while you are on camera in the Green Room.</p>
<p>Select the correct stage from the event login page. Scroll down on this page to find the stage in question.</p>
<p><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9684534515220/multi_track_navigation_landing_page.gif" alt="multi track navigation landing page.gif"></p>
<p>Within the event a Track Hamburger at the top left corner of the event will pop out the event navigation panel and you can click on the track you would like to go to.</p>

<h1 id="01G3E051Z5E4FPWWHYAY6B7TWK" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Best Practices</h1>
<ul>
<li>Starting a recording takes a few seconds (about 10-15 seconds). It's best to start recording a little bit earlier than the event's start to ensure you capture everything (i.e. don't start the recording just as you push a speaker to the stage). You can always cut extra footage during the editing process.</li>
<li>You can start and stop the recording as many times as you'd like. It will create a new file each time.</li>
<li>You <strong>cannot record </strong>breakout rooms and lounges.</li>
<li>If your event is over three hours, the best practice is to start and stop the recordings during intermissions to create new video files in the system. Extremely long videos (3+ hours) are prone to corruption/error and will not generate an SRT file (captions).</li>
<li>Double-check to make sure that you've hit "stop record" at the end of your event. This is very important. If you forget to do this the recording might become corrupted/unplayable.</li>
<li>If you need to change your event time to enable recordings, please make sure you set the time at least 15 minutes in the future to allow the recording server to spin up.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="01G3E051Z547Z59VFC30WRXZ7H">How To Record</h1>
<p>In the Control Room above and to the right of the main stage will be the record button in red</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>The recording button will appear approximately one hour before the start time of your event. Otherwise, it is greyed out.</li>

<p><strong>Use one of the integrated email registration options (Google, LinkedIn, Outlook) if possible.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When using one of the integrated email registration options, a speaker won’t have to wait for a confirmation email that might be blocked by their IT department or hidden in their junk/spam folder.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="01G14GWED267D7R0M9AH6VH4YA"><strong>Technical Details</strong></h1>
<h2 id="h_01EWGXF1FWC3A1XG4AATMZJ2DF"><strong>Browser</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Computer (desktop/laptop)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While screen sharing is now supported on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, we still recommend the latest version of Chrome. The latest update for Chrome can be found <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Refreshing your Browser</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have any issues or blips one of the first things to do is to refresh your browser. This will resolve a large portion of issues. For multi-day events you are speaking in please make sure you refresh your browser between days. <strong>The video feed token generated in the browser has a 24hr duration. Simply refreshing your browser will generate a new one</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keep your computer “clean” while presenting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conserve processing power and bandwidth as much as possible while presenting. To ensure a smooth experience, we recommend speakers close out all other tabs and browsers except the ones required while in the Welcome Platform (one instance of Welcome, a presentation, etc). Furthermore, disable any notifications and pop-ups on your device to avoid distractions.</li>
<li>The best way to do this if you are unsure if applications are open is to <strong>hard restart</strong> your computer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Maximize your browsing window</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If a speaker is presenting, it is best practice to have 2 screens (one for Welcome, one for the presentation). Minimized windows may block buttons and features on Welcome.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use an Incognito window</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are having issues with your mic/camera, using an incognito or private window should clear up any potential conflicts in the Green Room and in lounges/breakouts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01EWGXF82QAH7AD4T433G19823"><strong>Audio &amp; Video</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Browser Permissions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The most common issues with mics and audio are the privacy/security permissions within the browser settings.<iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/0736074ad65844f08a484ef525550e61" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</li>
<li>Programs conflicting with each other can also throw an error. To ensure that your speaker has a smooth onboarding, please make sure that their mic/camera is not being used by other programs (Zoom, Skype, Hangouts, etc).
<ul>
<li>Make sure to turn these off when joining a Welcome event. If you're not sure what could be causing the conflict, give your computer a <strong>hard restart</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01EWGXG5SKAG3KX6RH24NY9NBT"><strong>Connection</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Turn off VPNs and firewalls if possible</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are seeing a black/blank screen on the Welcome Platform it is most likely due to a VPN, please turn that off if possible.
<ul>
<li>We see these turned on mostly for work computers and/or work wifi. Have your speakers try to use a personal computer on a home wifi network. In some extreme cases, you may want to suggest turning a mobile device into a wifi hotspot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adblocking extensions can also cause issues with Welcome. We recommend turning those off or joining through an incognito/private window.</li>
<li>In some rare cases, restarting the modem/router has fixed this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Good internet speeds - at least 50mbps download and 25mbps upload</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We strongly recommend at least 50mbps download and 25mbps upload. If speeds are lower, your speakers will potentially experience choppy/laggy visuals and sound. It is best to have good speed on a solid router and use a hardwired connection whenever possible.</li>
<li>To conserve bandwidth, make sure your speakers should try to minimize the number of devices using their internet while they are presenting (i.e. smart TVs, mobile devices, etc.)</li>
<li>You can have your speakers do a speed test to determine their internet speeds. You can use this speed test <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=speed+test&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS866US866&amp;oq=speed+test&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l3j46l3j69i60.1025j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01EWGXGBRV844TWZSEQXFGFAV7"><strong>Screen Sharing</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>If you are screen sharing a 4k display please scale your resolution down to 1080p for the event</li>
<li>For the best experience screen sharing on Welcome, use a second monitor so you can see both your slides on one screen and the Welcome Platform on the other. If you are using PowerPoint, be sure you use slide show mode so that Welcome screen shares the entire presentation from your second monitor. If you are using Keynote with a second monitor, you can avoid the presenter view by playing your slideshow using the "Play Slideshow in Window" setting in the Play tab.<br>

</ul>
</li>
<li>When generating slides for the event be mindful that the speaker bubbles will be on the bottom left corner of the screen. You will want to design your slides around that. This is a presentation template you can base your designs around <a class="ssc-anchor-5cc4402e scc-c-btn-bbfcb644 scc-c-btn--anchor-bbfcb644" tabindex="0" href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360088872991/bubble_size_for_presentations.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bubble size for presentations.pptx</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>If your speaker is on a Mac</strong>, you will need to ensure their privacy/security settings to allow screen recording for Chrome. You may also need to confirm these settings for the microphone and camera as well.
<ul>
<li>Go to System Preferences &gt;Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Scroll down to Screen Recording &gt; Check box for Google Chrome.<img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360085638811/Untitled_design.gif" alt="Untitled_design.gif" width="590" height="332">

</ul>
<h2 id="h_01EWGXGJ5CKKWWC845PKBY2CYB"><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></h2>
<p>If everything has been followed and the speaker is still having issues try these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refreshing the browser</li>
<li>Try an Incognito/Private window</li>
<li>Restart the computer</li>
<li>Restart Router/modem</li>

<p>To make sure your event goes off without a hitch, you need to make sure your speakers can get into the Green Room. Additionally, Breakouts and Lounges are key methods for engaging your audience in an event. With that in mind, it's clear that these are vital functions in making sure your event is jaw-dropping and engaging for your audience. However, there can be a few ways that users can run into issues when trying to join:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microphone/camera permissions issue within the browser (most common). On Macs, there are also system-level permissions that can also cause issues in some cases.</li>
<li>A conflict with the microphone/camera being used by another program (Zoom, Skype, Hangouts, etc).
<ul>
<li>The best practice is to make sure to turn these off. If you're not sure what else is accessing your microphone/camera, give your computer a restart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, you can catch these early (before the event) when using the <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" href="https://app.experiencewelcome.com/compatibility-check">compatibility checker</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">. </span>Here are a few solutions for the browser permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that your browser settings allow camera and microphone usage within <a href="http://experiencewelcome.com">experiencewelcome.com</a>. You can also use an incognito/private window to force a new permission check.</li>
<li>Below is a short video walkthrough for the Chrome browser (we have a complete permissions walkthrough here: <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058944832" target="_self">Troubleshooting Permission Issues</a>)
<ul>
<li>If you've gone through all of these steps and are still hitting issues, please try a hard computer restart.</li>

</li>
</ol>

<p>Go back to <a href="http://generator.email">generator.email</a> and scroll down, you will see the Welcome email to confirm registration<img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360081649951/burner_2.png" alt="burner_2.png"></p>
</li>
<li>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><font size="6">2020 Favorite Feature Roundup</font></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">With so many changes to the product in the last few months, we’ve put together our top feature picks for 2020:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Making registration easier with One-Click Invitations: Over the last few months, we’ve included one-click invitations which allow them to register for and access your event through one URL. You can bulk send One-Click Registrations to all unconfirmed attendees with the click of a button.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Easy access to event recordings from your Event dashboard: As soon as your event is done, your recordings are available in your Event Dashboard!</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Disable &amp; enable communication features: From Public Chats to Q&amp;A to the People list, you can toggle these features on and off depending on your requirements.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Increased main stage capacity: From only 4 to now being able to have 8 people on the main stage.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Breakout Room &amp; Lounge Room Experience: You asked, we listened. We made many updates over the last few months to improve the breakout &amp; lounge room experiences: increased room capacity to 16 people, added screen sharing and enabled customizations in the Lounge Rooms such as logo, brand color, call-to-action button, and unique photobooth templates. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><font size="6">Your Feedback Matters</font></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The feature updates and fixes that you experienced over the last few months have been greatly influenced by the feedback from our customers. We hear you!</p>

<p>As an emcee, you may want to address some housekeeping at the beginning of the event for the audience. This is great to do, to keep attendees focused on the event rather than fumbling around trying to figure things out.</p>

</ul><h1>Mobile/Safari Experience</h1>
<p>This article is for users logging in via</p>
<ul>
<li>Safari on desktop</li>
<li>Mobile/tablet with any browser</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that mobile and desktop Safari is not our recommended browser; we recommend using Chrome when possible. <strong>If you are a speaker or a producer please use Chrome on a desktop. </strong>Safari is now compatible with these features, but we do not recommend using it over Chrome.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5492453450644/Screen_Shot_2022-04-11_at_8.46.28_AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-11 at 8.46.28 AM.png"></p>
<h2 id="01FVDJ1RY6KV9R2GWHB4KEYB09">Safari Desktop</h2>
<p>Safari desktop has some limitations, but much of it is very similar to the desktop experience with other browsers. </p>
<h3 id="01FZ8E8E3F5SAB4YWCBECXX963">Limitations:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Screen Sharing will not work.</li>
<li>Unlike Chrome, Safari doesn't automatically update on your computer so people may be on older versions. Older versions of safari (14.0) may encounter these issues.<br>
<ul>
<li>If your video feed is black, either refresh or mute and unmute the video to resolve.</li>
<li>Welcome on Safari is device resource-intensive, not as much of a concern as an attendee but as a producer and speaker please use Chrome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="01FVDJ1RY6GDKBKFNFP7G33FGB">Mobile</h2>
<p>You will have a feature panel at the bottom of the screen that will give you access to Public Chat, Polls, and Q&amp;A. Mobile users are now able to swap between stages for multi-stage events via a drop-down at the top of the page.</p>
<p>The video below will show you what it looks like to go from the registration page to the stage.</p>

<h3 id="01FVDJ1RY6993V9V85FPBQTZ0Z">Things to note if you are a Producer</h3>
<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">The people who are viewing the event on mobile will show up differently in the people tab. Please note that you cannot interact with them in any way. Also, note that non-mobile attendees will not be able to see them in the people tab. <br><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4418823362324/Screen_Shot_2022-02-08_at_1.09.49_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-08 at 1.09.49 PM.png">
</li>
<li>If you are trying to test mobile out for yourself, please note that the start/end times for your event need to match up and the doors need to be open. Additionally, if changing these times please give at least 15 minutes between when you change the time and the event start time (this will allow time for the mobile server to spin up).
<ul>
<li>For example, if you want to test out mobile for an event that starts at 4pm but are trying to log on via mobile at 1pm it won't work. You will need to wait until at least 3pm (1 hour before the start time) and have the doors open.</li>

<p>Ensuring that your event goes smoothly requires your speakers to have no issues. Below we have listed some common issues that a speaker might run into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#h_01EY49WQM19TAH2JXVH6KB97X4" target="_self">Registration or log-in issues.</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#h_01EY49WZ8BHTZ5X4M2DY8DAQJ5" target="_self">Speaker can't join the Green Room and/or lounges/breakouts</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#h_01EY49X484ZQC362VGJAM8SSDH" target="_self">Speaker can't hear anyone in the Green Room. Other people can't hear the speaker in the Green Room.</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#h_01EY49XBMQZP857KVK2ZYXT62E" target="_self">Speaker is having internet issues (audio is lagging, video is cutting in and out).</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#h_01EY49XJ2R7K2EP0WHYRJSART2" target="_self">Speaker is seeing a blank screen despite there being a presentation going on.</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#h_01EY49XT8VCKTYDJG9W1Z579ZC" target="_self">Speaker keeps getting “kicked out”.</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#h_01EY49Y17P38FA1826PBP3QY3S" target="_self">Speaker’s audio is giving a lot of feedback.</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#h_01EY49YAANVWKHNZX09D6T7Q7B" target="_self">Speaker can’t screen share.</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#h_01EY49YKBHCM55251Y8GHQQEJM" target="_self">When screen sharing, the speaker’s presentation takes up the whole screen, and can’t see Welcome.</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#h_01EY49YRTZFRJ85HJBVZFDX14S" target="_self">Speaker's screen share is pixelated.</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h4 id="h_01EY49WQM19TAH2JXVH6KB97X4"><strong>Registration or login issues</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>VPNs, firewalls, adblocking extensions, or other security can sometimes block Welcome. If it's a VPN or firewall issue please ask your speaker to resolve it on their side (turning it off, switching computers, etc.).
<ul>
<li>Welcome Support can also toggle on something on our end to mitigate these issues. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> if you are not able to resolve these issues by deactivating security software/programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your speakers are having trouble logging you in you can send them a "one-click registration" email from the Event Dashboard. Just make sure they check their spam/junk folders for the email, or copy the link from the dashboard and send it to them. From there they will just need to fill out a few details and they can enter the event right after.
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="h_01EY49WZ8BHTZ5X4M2DY8DAQJ5"><strong>Speaker can't join the Green Room and/or lounges/breakouts</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Microphone/camera permissions issue within the browser (most common). On Macs, there are also system-level permissions that can also cause issues in some cases.</li>
<li>A conflict with the microphone/camera being used by another program (Zoom, Skype, Hangouts, etc).
<ul>
<li>The best practice is to make sure to turn these off. If you're not sure what else is accessing your microphone/camera, give your computer a restart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="h_01EY49X484ZQC362VGJAM8SSDH"><strong>Speaker can't hear anyone in the Green Room. Other people can't hear the speaker in the Green Room</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Have them unmute the Green Room and mainstage. Please also have them confirm their Green Room audio is not muted.</li>
<li>Have them check AV settings by clicking on the A/V Gear icon in the Green Room. From here, they should be able to swap between different microphone options.</li>
<li>Have them close any browsers or applications (i.e. Zoom) that could be using their mic and/or camera.</li>
<li>Have them try logging in using an incognito/private window.</li>
<li>Check computer sound settings:
<ul>
<li>For Mac devices:
<ul>
<li>Go to System Preferences</li>
<li>Choose Sound</li>
<li>Select the output and input they would like to use</li>
<li>Have them refresh their browser and log back into Welcome</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For PC devices:
<ul>
<li>Go to Settings</li>
<li>Choose Sound</li>
<li>Select the output and input they would like to use</li>
<li>Have them refresh their browser and log back into Welcome</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If none of the above works try a hard computer restart.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="h_01EY49XBMQZP857KVK2ZYXT62E"><strong>Speaker is having internet issues (audio is lagging, video is cutting in and out, etc.)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Hopefully, you've confirmed that the speaker has a decent internet connection before they join. We recommend having speakers run through our <a href="https://app.experiencewelcome.com/compatibility-check" target="_self">Compatability Checker</a> prior to the event.</li>
<li>Some solutions to fix connection issues: 
<ul>
<li>Restart computer</li>
<li>Restart router</li>
<li>After the above there isn't a ton you can do from your side. You can ask them to maybe conserve as much local bandwidth (have other people on the same wifi log off, close uneccessary tabs/programs, etc.) as possible until their presentation is over.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Producers also can instruct people in the Green Room to turn off video to conserve bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="h_01EY49XJ2R7K2EP0WHYRJSART2"><strong>Speaker is seeing a blank screen despite there being a presentation going on</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>This is almost always related to device security or a connection issue. For device security, please ask your speaker to deactivate from the security service. For internet issues, please follow the steps in the above section.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="h_01EY49XT8VCKTYDJG9W1Z579ZC"><strong>Speaker keeps getting “kicked out”</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>This usually means the person has another window or tab with Welcome open. Have them close everything except the one instance of Welcome they are in. Please also make sure that your speaker does not share their account details or one-click link with anyone else.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="h_01EY49Y17P38FA1826PBP3QY3S"><strong>Speaker’s audio is giving a lot of feedback</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Mute everyone in the Green Room except the speaker to see if it continues. If it does, it's something causing feedback on the speaker's end (poor connection of mic, dying bluetooth headset, etc.). If it doesn’t it's someone else in the Green Room, make sure no one happens to have another computer with the Welcome event running in the background where the noise might bleed in.</li>
<li>Ask the speaker to use headphones or lower the volume of their speakers.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="h_01EY49YAANVWKHNZX09D6T7Q7B"><strong>Speaker can’t screenshare</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Most screen sharing issues happen when a speaker is using Firefox or Edge. We recommend that anyone screen sharing uses Chrome.</li>
<li>If on a Mac, you will need to check privacy/security settings to allow screen recording for Chrome.
<ul>
<li>Go to System Preferences &gt;Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Scroll down to Screen Recording &gt; Check box for Google Chrome.</li>
<li><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360085637811/Untitled_design.gif" alt="Untitled_design.gif"></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="h_01EY49YKBHCM55251Y8GHQQEJM"><strong>When screen sharing, the speaker’s presentation takes up the whole screen and can’t see Welcome</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>For the best experience screen sharing on Welcome, we recommend that speakers use a second monitor so they can see both their slides on one screen and the Welcome Platform on the other. If they are using PowerPoint, be sure they use slide show mode so that the Welcome screen shares their entire presentation from their second monitor. If they are using Keynote with a second monitor, they can avoid the presenter view by playing their slideshow using the "Play Slideshow in Window" setting in the Play tab.</li>
<li>More in-depth walkthroughs are available here for <a class="notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053529731-Screensharing-Presentations-1-screen-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot="">one screen</a> and <a class="notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053424631-Screensharing-Presentations-2-screens-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="3" data-reactroot="">two screens</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="h_01EY49YRTZFRJ85HJBVZFDX14S"><strong>Speaker's screen sharing is pixelated</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The producer might need to “kick the screen share” out of the Green Room and have the speaker re-share it.</li>
<li>Have them close all browsers and restart their computer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Breakouts allow for magic moments to occur in a much more intimate environment. Breakouts are smaller personalized sessions with up to 16 attendees to engage and discuss with each other. In an event, you can have up to 50 breakout rooms per stage. Our breakout rooms allow events to become more engaging and, for lack of a better word, eventful.</p>

<p>With spring on the way, we’ve been busy brewing up some new and exciting product features. Read on to find out how we are improving the producer experience and helping your team capture data to measure your event’s success on Welcome.<br><br></p>
<h4><strong>A one-stop shop for all things analytics<br></strong></h4>
<p>We’re thrilled to bring you V1 of Welcome’s built-in analytics dashboard. It’s a self-serve tool that lets you fetch data quickly and automatically—which means you no longer need to nudge our team for every metric (that’s a win-win!). After every event, you can view and download all of your event data including attendance, breakouts, lounges, chat, Q&amp;A, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="https://hs-8808898.f.hubspotemail.net/hub/8808898/hubfs/Stats.png?upscale=true&amp;width=1120&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=Stats.png" alt="Stats" width="661" height="372"></p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>Email Allow List by domain<br></strong></h4>
<p>Email Allow List is no longer limited to a CSV upload; you can now set up an allow list by domain. Simply navigate to your event details, choose <em>Email Allow List </em>option and add a specific domain (i.e. “@experiencewelcome.com”). This will give anyone with that email domain the ability to register for your event. </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>
<strong>All of your one-click registration links in CSV<br></strong>Accessing all of your attendees’ one-click registration links in one place is now simpler than ever. You can download a .csv file of all your attendees’ custom links from the event dashboard, making it easier for you to include them in your personalized event invitations. They will also be available for two weeks instead of one!</h4><h1>Facebook Streaming Guide</h1>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360091054952/streaming_error_screenshot.png" alt="streaming_error_screenshot.png" width="449" height="202"></p>
<ul>
<li>Check if the streaming service enabled and active
<ul>
<li>Some streaming services will let you know that it is waiting for you to connect. If you see that then you are active</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360091029371/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png" width="507" height="240"></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>If you do not see your streaming service is enabled then you will need to follow the streaming services instructions to get to that point</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the streaming service is active next thing to check is if your Stream Keys and Stream URL are correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Head over to the Event Dashboard Streaming tab and check the key and URL for that streaming service
<ul>
<li>If <strong>Incorrect</strong>
<ul>
<li>Close the event doors</li>
<li>Edit or Delete the existing entry by clicking on the 3 stacked dots on the right</li>
<li>Enter/Paste the correct information</li>
<li>Open the event doors</li>
<li>The stream will re-initialize which can take 20 - 30 seconds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If <strong>Correct</strong>
<ul>
<li>Close the event doors</li>
<li>Wait 10 to 15 seconds</li>
<li>Open the event doors</li>
<li>The stream will re-initialize which can take 20 - 30 seconds</li>
<li>If error appears again reach out to Welcome Tech Support <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Inactive streams (more than 15 minutes of idle time) will time out even if content starts streaming after. You will need to restart the stream in this case by closing and then opening the doors.</p>

<li>The streaming server will start preparing 1 hour before the event, so producers must ensure that the start/end time are set correctly. Please note that if you are changing your event's times you must leave a 20-minute gap to allow the streaming server time to kick in.</li>
<li>Streaming to your chosen services will start when you open your event doors and stop when you close them.</li>
<li>When doors open, they will no longer be able to modify stream settings.</li>
<li>The stream will be a <strong>view-only</strong> experience.
<ul>
<li>Viewers at Streaming sites will not be able to
<ul>
<li>View the Welcome chat interface, including Chat, Q&amp;A, Polls, and People</li>
<li>See or participate in Lounges or Breakouts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Youtube, Twitch, Facebook, and any other 3rd party will have their own chat and settings, which Welcome cannot see or get data from. You will need to access those platforms to make edits and collect data from them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Streams will have a short delay from the live event. This delay is typically between 10-20 seconds.</li>

<ul>
<li>The streaming server will start preparing 1 hour before the event, so producers must ensure that the start/end time are set correctly. Please note that if you are changing your event's times you must leave a 15-minute gap to allow the streaming server time to kick in.</li>
<li>Streaming to your chosen services will start when you open your event doors and stop when you close them.</li>
<li>When doors open, they will no longer be able to modify stream settings.</li>
<li>The stream will be a <strong>view-only</strong> experience.
<ul>
<li>Viewers at Streaming sites will not be able to
<ul>
<li>View the Welcome chat interface, including Chat, Q&amp;A, Polls, and People</li>
<li>See or participate in Lounges or Breakouts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Youtube, Twitch, Facebook, and any other 3rd party will have their own chat and settings, which Welcome cannot see or get data from. You will need to access those platforms to make edits and collect data from them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Streams will have a short delay from the live event. This delay is typically between 10-20 seconds.</li>

<p>In some cases, certain video players such as Quicktime and Windows Media Player are unable to play the MP4 recordings of the event. This is due to those players do not support all MP4 codecs. We recommend using <a href="https://www.videolan.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VLC Media Player</a> as it supports a larger range of video codecs.</p>
<p>We have a solution for this, it will require you to re-encode the video. You will need to download and install VLC Media Player</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>VLC Media Player</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Click Media </strong>and select <strong>Convert / Save</strong>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add </strong>under File Selection tab</li>
<li>Select the file to convert</li>
<li>At the bottom right Click <strong>Convert / Save</strong>
</li>
<li>In Profile, Select <strong>Video - H.264 + MP3 (MP4)</strong>
</li>
<li>At Destination, Click <strong>Browse</strong>
</li>
<li>Choose where you want the new file to go and the name you want for it. Click <strong>Save</strong> when finished</li>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> at the bottom right</li>
<li>Encoding will take time depending on the quality of your computer hardware and size of the video. Due to the resource intensive nature of encoding you may experience some slowdown on your computer and it might be wise to leave in alone and come back later.</li>

<p>Uploading and downloading CSV files is a great way to collect bulk amounts of data about your attendees and speakers.</p>
<h2 id="01FTEPNGHGPSPTSMMF7PG48AM8">Uploading CSV</h2>
<p>1. Make sure to format the CSV exactly how our template shows (attached at the bottom of this article and also within the Welcome platform. Columns in the wrong place will cause errors. </p>
<p><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360090431071/Screen_Shot_2021-03-23_at_2.14.40_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-03-23_at_2.14.40_PM.png"></p>

<p>2. <strong>Email, first name, and last name are required fields.</strong><strong> You can leave the other sections blank.</strong></p>
<p>3. Please note the character limits for each column. </p>
<ul>
<li>Email: none</li>
<li>First Name: none</li>
<li>Last Name: none</li>
<li>Role: 100 character maximum <strong>(Be careful here as this part is often too long)</strong>
</li>
<li>Company: 100 character maximum <strong>(Be careful here as this part is often too long)</strong>
</li>
<li>Tagline: 70 character maximum</li>
<li>Profile Photo: none</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Please note that we only accept 2000 rows (people) to be uploaded at a time. <strong>If you have more than 2000 rows you will need to break up the CSV</strong> and upload them separately. </p>
<p>5. Please note that we have a 100-user limit for Speaker uploads. </p>
<p>6. If there are duplicates in the CSV they will be skipped over. In other words, they will only show up once. </p>
<p>7. Uploading a CSV will not override what is already in the list. In other words, uploading a CSV will not delete anyone from the list who is already there. </p>
<p>8. Names and special characters will work, though they will be edited/formatted automatically and hence may be off. You can edit these entries manually in the dashboard if need be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Auður will display as Au_ur</li>
<li>Flóki will display as Fl-ki</li>
<li>Kristján will display as Kristj-n</li>
<li>Sólúlfur will display as S--loelfur</li>
</ul>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You can enter the Studio in two ways, from the Event Dashboard or directly from the event link.</p>
<h2 id="h_01F4HJXEZ39Z14CJ1FGJR1FH79">Green Room</h2>

<p>Think of the Green Room as the staging area for your speakers before they hit the Stage and present to the entire event. Anyone who needs to be on the Stage will need to enter the Green Room first.</p>
<h4 id="01FTERV49BA8PFTFSSS2YTPB4R">Functions available</h4>
<ul>
<li>Green Room Volume - This room has a volume slider independent of the Stage; this will allow you to hear what you need to hear and turn down what you don't. 
<ul>
<li>When Speakers go from the Green Room to the Stage this volume will default to mute; this occurs so that speakers on the Stage are not distracted by the Green Room chatter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A/V Cogwheel - allows you to change your camera and microphone devices.</li>
<li>Screen share/Present Button - This will enable you to share your desktop, application, or Chrome tab.
<ul>
<li>If you also want to share audio you can check the "Share Audio" at the bottom left of the pop-up when sharing a Chrome tab or sharing on a Windows computer.</li>
<li>If sharing via a Mac device for the first time, you may need to alter your devices system preferences to allow Chrome access. Our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058944832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Troubleshooting Permission Issues</a> article explains how to do that in detail (at the bottom of the article).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Join/Leave Green Room Button - How to enter/exit the Green Room.
<ul>
<li>Only Producers/Staff can enter and exit on a whim. Speakers and attendees will need to be invited to join the Green Room.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>User Video Previews - When you hover your mouse over the different users in the Green Room, you will be presented with some options:

<li>X Button - Kicks the user out of the Green Room.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Green Room itself has a 12 "person" limit and the Stage has an 8 "person" limit
<ul>
<li>Screen shares count as one person.</li>
<li>A video playing on the Stage also counts as one person.</li>
<li>Because of these limits, we recommend you only have people in the Green Room that need to be there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note that as a producer, you do not need to be in the Green Room to hear what's going on in the Green Room.</li>

<p>This is the panel where you will be managing your assets along with where you will be able to push them to the live Stage. You will be able to play videos, audio and set your images such as backgrounds and overlays. Please go to our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053392351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graphics and Video Dimensions</a> article for specific details.

<p>Permissions are probably the most common issue users have with Welcome. Permissions are both browser-based (camera and mic) and system-based (primarily for Macs), so depending on what and how you will be using Welcome you may need to confirm both are set correctly. Microphone and camera browser permissions will come up when trying to join the Green Room or Lounges and Breakouts. The other permission issue deals with screen sharing on a Mac (details found <a href="#h_01F29WJYW8BQCHD1YHMYXMD0QK" target="_self">below</a>).</p>

<p>This is a common view when joining a room that requires a camera and microphone but your permissions are blocking access to the devices.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360091356872/camera_mic_permissions_denied.png" alt="camera_mic_permissions_denied.png" width="491" height="190"></p>
<p>This is an easy fix and we have 3 different ways of resolving this. This article is going to break it down step by step. This guide will be using <strong>Chrome</strong> as the browser since it is our recommended browser to use with Welcome.</p>
<h2 id="h_01F29WJE2FD8WWB56W7GQXNMJF">Approving Permission by Popup</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360091362192/Chrome_PC_pop_up.gif" alt="Chrome_PC_pop_up.gif" width="508" height="286"></p>
<p>By default, Chrome has Camera and Microphone permissions set to Ask. What this will do is cause a pop-up to appear at the top left of the screen just under the URL bar. Please do not ignore and close the pop-up, it is asking to approve permissions. Simply click Allow and then in Welcome the Camera and Microphone settings become available. In some cases, you may need to refresh the browser.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If the pop-up does not appear or if you closed the pop-up by accident. Have no fear we can still make changes to approve permissions by clicking the lock icon in the URL bar.</p>

<h1 id="h_01F29WJYW8BQCHD1YHMYXMD0QK">System Setting Permissions</h1>
<p>If you are going to be utilizing your camera/microphone and/or screen sharing on a Mac for the first time you might need to update these settings in your System Preferences. Without having these settings properly set, you will receive a permission error stating "Permission denied by system." Below is a quick walkthrough on how you can enable these permissions. Windows devices tend to have fewer of these situations but we also provide some steps for Windows devices. </p>
<p>An important thing to note is that some updates to your browser can cause your computer not to recognize permissions you have already set. In cases like these, please remove the permissions, re-add them, and then restart your browser.</p>

<p>In some cases, certain video players such as Quicktime and Windows Media Player are unable to play the MP4 recordings of the event. This is due to those players do not support all MP4 codecs. We recommend using <a href="https://www.videolan.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VLC Media Player</a> as it supports a larger range of video codecs.</p>
<p>We have a solution for this, it will require you to re-encode the video. You will need to download and install a free software called <a href="https://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Handbrake</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h_01F389JPJA573GD5KR6NX2A50C" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">People - Attendees, Speakers, and Staff</h2>
<p>This is where you manage the users of your event. If needed, you can change the name of these in "Event Details". Anyone except staff who registers will default as an Attendee. Speakers will either need to be added manually or promoted from attendee to speaker after they have registered. The interface for each of the user types are largely the same with minor differences. Let's dive into the different functions and note the differences as we go.</p>
<h3 id="01FRK3QTHA1GMC539ZHHEQFFY7">Sending Invites</h3>
<p>You have multiple ways to send invites from this section ranging from bulk groups to individual users.</p>
<p>Sending invites in bulk can simply be done by clicking the "Send Invites" button at the top right corner. This will send invites to all those with an unconfirmed status. This feature is unavailable for Staff.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4414785740948/Send_Mass_Invites.gif" alt="Send Mass Invites.gif" width="519" height="292"></p>

<p>Lastly, you can either send a One-Click Link to a user via email or copy and paste it to the user with whatever method you would like to do it. To do so you will see an Action Column to the right of every user.</p>

The required fields for creating an account are first name, last name, and email address; you do not need to add in a user's role/company or image to create an account. You will not be able to add anyone for Staff; instead, Staff users can simply login to the event and they will automatically populate.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Adding users in bulk can be done with a CSV upload by clicking the "Upload" button at the top right to access the pop-up. We have a specific template and instructions for the uploads that you will need to use (the only required fields are first name, last name, and email address).

<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Promoting an attendee to a speaker can be done by clicking the 3 stacked dots in the action column to the far right of the users row.

<h1>RTMP Out</h1>
<p>We now allow broadcasting your event to a 3rd party outside of the Welcome platform. Now, if you want to reach the widest audience possible, you can; Welcome is pre-configured to connect to YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook. We will also allow you to push your feed through custom RTMP settings. Check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058345371" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Streaming Out - General Guide</a> for further details.</p>
<h1>Watch Lounge</h1>
<p>We heard feedback that the 16 person limit for our lounges is a bummer, so we added the ability to watch our lounges. So, even when rooms are packed with 16 participants, you can still jump in and view the discussion in the room. Watchers can still interact through the room chat, and if a participant slot opens up, they can slide on in. Check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058706352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lounge Guide</a> for further details.</p>

It's best to make a copy of the existing slide deck and modify the copy.

<ol>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Create your event for your recording session in your Organization Dashboard.
<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">In some cases, you may want to create multiple recording event sessions that span different dates.
<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Please make sure that your event times are set correctly as well otherwise the recording server will not be spun up. If you need to change the event time, please make sure that you allow a fifteen-minute grace period before you begin to allow the server to spin up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If you are going to re-use the same event please ensure the start and end times do not span for multiple days. We advise keeping everything one day at a time and updating the event times for each new day. This will ensure the recording server is up to date and does not time out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Add the speaker(s) you need for your recording session within the speaker tab of your Event Dashboard.</li>
<li>Follow the same speaker onboarding process as you would for an event. We have a Speaker Onboarding guide <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052720251">here</a> in case you need it.
<ul>
<li>If the recording session is going to be with one person or a small group, you may be able to get away with onboarding the speaker the same day as the recording.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Day of the recording, perform your tech checks with the speaker(s). If you are having camera or screen sharing permission issues, please refer to our <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058944832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">Troubleshooting Permission Issues</a> article.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="01G25895ZPZ4C5PHAY1052D1KD" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can start and stop the recording as many times as you'd like. It will create a new file each time. </li>
<li>The recording function does have a 10 to 15 seconds delay after you press start. It's better to press record early. You can always cut extra footage during the editing process.</li>
<li>As opposed to live events, recording content allows you to make extra takes. Keep that in mind, and don't always feel forced to do it all in one take.</li>
<li>When doing extra takes, make sure the speaker takes a brief pause between them to allow an easier time in editing. </li>
<li>Use overlays and assets; this allows you to create an edge over just a camera recording. We have a couple of articles on using <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061015032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keynote</a> and <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061462771" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Slides</a> to create overlays. </li>
</ul>

<p>In the Control Room above and to the right of the main stage will be the record button.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>The recording button will appear approximately 1 hour before the start time of your event, otherwise, it is greyed out.</li>
<li>If you need to update your event start time, make sure to do it 15 minutes before you intend to start recording.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="01G25895ZP2W2FC2AW9XEC3DNX">Where To Find Recordings</h2>
<p>Recordings are stored in the Event Dashboard. The recordings will be 720p at 60fps H264 codec MP4 files.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Go to the left sidebar, and toward the bottom is the "Recording" section. Within there, click on the "Download Recording" button to download the video file.</li>

<h2 id="01G258CNW623WMJ8M3K6Z128KM" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Editing Your Videos</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If you are going to edit your videos here is a list of things to be mindful about:</p>
<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Audio levels - it's always good to double-check your audio levels to ensure that they are not too quiet or too loud. You don't want audio to go over 0db, this will cause your audio to be too loud and start clipping. <strong>A good rule of thumb is to look for an overall mix level of -10db to -14db</strong>.</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Export settings - If you want to use the edited video on Welcome we have some recommendations
<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">File Type - MP4</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Resolution - 720p to 1080p</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Frame Rate - Use the same rate as the OG file, 60fps</li>
</ul>
</li>

</div><h1>Closed Captions Guide</h1>
<p>Accessibility for your event is essential, and for many organizations, closed captioning may be a requirement. Welcome offers a closed captioning feature that meets the international WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards. If you are interested in this feature for your organization, please contact your Customer Success Manager for specifics. At the moment, closed captioning only captures live content on the stage (this does not include pre-recorded videos).</p>
<h1 id="01G022Y0NDFTFZ3APVS1BY49XC">How to Enable your Closed Captioning</h1>

</ul><h1>Integrations - Splash - Implementation</h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Splash / Welcome Integration Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome offers an integration that connects a Splash Event to a Welcome Event, syncing registrant data between the platforms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The integration makes it easier for registrants who sign up on a Splash Registration page to navigate and check in to a Welcome virtual event, with the intent to maximize attendance at your Welcome event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following steps will allow a Splash administrator to send Event registrants into the Welcome platform. After a Splash guest is sent to Welcome, the guest’s information in Splash is updated with a unique event link for them to access the event seamlessly. This unique link can be used as a personalization token in event reminder emails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The integration will create new Splash Guests if there are people who checked in to the Welcome Event but were not in Splash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, the integration will check for updated attendee information on a daily basis. It will update all splash guests with their most up-to-date registration status at that time.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Before We Begin</strong></p>
<p>* Enabling this integration requires the "Producer" role in Welcome</p>
<p>* Enabling this integration requires the "Admin" role in Splash. A Pro or Enterprise level Splash account is required to implement the full functionality of the integration, as described above. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Steps 1-8 explain how to configure Splash so that the integration can populate a Splash Event with a Welcome Unique Link for each guest.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Contact your representative at Splash and request the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>API Client ID</li>
<li>API Client Secret</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Provide the above information to your Customer Success Manager or Solutions Engineer at Welcome, as well as login credentials for your Splash environment.</p>
<p>3. Within <strong>Splash</strong>, click on the event you want to integrate with Welcome and navigate to the "Settings" page.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402684538004/Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_3.52.10_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_3.52.10_PM.png"></p>
<p>4. In <strong>Splash</strong>, in the "Event Information" tab, scroll down to find the "Tags" field.</p>
<p>5. In the "Tags" field, please input the event "ID" for the event in Welcome you would like to associate the Splash event with. You can find the event "ID" in the <strong>Welcome platform</strong> by navigating to the Event Dashboard in Welcome. The event "ID" is a string of 6 characters that immediately follows "https://app.experiencewelcome.com/events/" in the event URL. <strong>This is how the Welcome platform will recognize which event in Splash it will need to send registrant data back to.</strong></p>
<p>In the example screenshot below, the event "ID" is "nyuW1Z".</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402684588948/Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_3.59.58_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_3.59.58_PM.png"></p>
<p>Within <strong>Splash</strong>, It is important to note that you must hit the ENTER key on your keyboard as well as click the "save" button on the top right-hand corner of the Splash page in order for the tag to be saved properly.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402684836628/Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_4.20.07_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_4.20.07_PM.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402684865684/Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_4.21.07_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_4.21.07_PM.png"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We now need to create a custom field in the event registration that aggregates the custom, unique URL for each attendee. This will ultimately go out in an email so that the attendee can seamlessly be navigated to the event occurring in Welcome with one click of the mouse. Steps 6-9 below describe one method to create this field, but there are other methods. Please engage with a Solutions Engineer or Customer Success Manager to further discuss.</p>
<p>6. Navigate back to the "Event" and click on the "Registration Form" tile on the center screen in <strong>Splash.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402685664660/Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_5.07.58_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_5.07.58_PM.png"></p>
<p>7. On the right-hand side of the screen, click the "Add Question" button at the bottom of the "Content" tab. Click the "Create New" tab and select the "Text (single line) option and click "Add to Form".</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402686849812/Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_8.49.31_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_8.49.31_PM.png" width="213" height="518">                              <img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402686854548/Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_8.51.18_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_8.51.18_PM.png" width="364" height="337"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>8. Please type in <strong>"Unique Link For Welcome Event"</strong> in the Label field exactly. <strong>It is important to emphasize that we must use this exact, case sensitive syntax.</strong> You will notice that the "Field Name" field will auto-populate as well.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4403292383892/Screen_Shot_2021-07-07_at_12.45.32_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-07-07_at_12.45.32_PM.png" width="319" height="363"></p>
<p>9.  Click the "Edit Logic" button on the bottom right-hand corner. Click "Add Condition" in the new window. The logic should be as follow: Unique Link for Welcome Event will be hidden unless &lt;First Name&gt; equals "Hide Always". Click Done.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402686935572/Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_9.02.52_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_9.02.52_PM.png" width="496" height="439"></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Steps 10-13 are required to properly send registrant data from the Splash event to the Welcome event so that the guest does not need to re-enter any information when they check into Welcome.</strong></p>
<p>10. Navigate back to the "Settings" page for the event. Click the "Integrations" tab. Click the "New Integration" button. A few tiles will pop-up, scroll down and select "HTTP".</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402687338644/Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_9.16.50_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_9.16.50_PM.png" width="288" height="339"></p>
<p>11. In the Authentication tab, confirm that "Authentication Type" is set to "No Authentication". Then, Click Request Settings. In the Endpoint section, choose "POST" as the "Method". <strong>A Welcome Solutions Engineer and/or Customer Success Manager will provide a URL to fill in the "Postback URL" field at this point.</strong> Choose "Content-Type"  as "application/JSON".</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402687431572/Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_9.35.29_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-06-24_at_9.35.29_PM.png" width="920" height="117"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>12. In the "Triggers" section, please select "Attendee" as the trigger, and check the "RSVP Yes" box. This is what will allow Splash to send the updated statuses of each invitee to Welcome in real-time.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402899928852/Screen_Shot_2021-06-29_at_12.26.23_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-06-29_at_12.26.23_PM.png" width="546" height="280"></p>

<p>13. In order to properly deliver attendee data to the Welcome platform, we must map the attendee's contact information in Splash to the proper fields within Welcome. <strong>It is important to be aware that First Name, Last Name, and Email Address must be mapped at a minimum.</strong> It is also important that while "Splash Field" names can be different we must use the exact field names under the "Remote Field" column, as below:</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 132px;" border="1">

<p>14. Let's go back to the Event Dashboard in Welcome. Please click on the "Integrations" tab on the left-hand side and click "Trigger Integration". Once this is clicked, the integration is complete! Every day, the integration will automatically find all registrants in the Welcome Event and update the Guests of the associated Splash Event with their most up to date registration status and their unique link. the integration will create new Splash Guests for email addresses it cannot find as existing Guests of the Splash Event. We recommend manually triggering the integration around three hours before the event so that we can ensure the highest probability of all attendees receiving their unique link.</p>

<p> </p><h1>Help, my Attendees/Speakers can only see a black screen and no audio!</h1>
<p>One of the most common issues you will hear from users is "Has it started yet? I only see a black screen and no audio". This is most likely due to either a VPN, some sort of network security like a firewall, and/or a security extension installed in their browser. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402856891924/VPN_1.png" alt="VPN_1.png" width="246" height="390"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Of the three ways this could happen, a VPN is the most common. The simplest solution to this is to ask if they are able to disable the VPN. This may not be possible in all cases, so let us break down the different ways this can happen with possible solutions.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"> </p>
<h2 id="01G3VV399CWYMZP5VW9CYVPANE" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">VPN </h2>
<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Turn off VPN if possible.</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Try a different browser or an incognito/private window.</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Use a different device; generally, we recommend a personal device as these are less likely to have security installed on the device.</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">
<a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055728552-Mobile-Safari-Experience" target="_self">View the event on mobile</a>. Attendees will still be able to utilize the chat, Q&amp;A, and polls on mobile. However, they will not be able to join lounges or breakout.</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If you are recording the event, offer a way to view the event recording.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="01G3VV399CV4KQT0S68818ET4W">Firewall</h2>
<ul>
<li>Move to a personal network such as using a mobile phone as a wifi hotspot. Sometimes a Guest network will work.</li>
<li>Offer your IT team our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405168567956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Networking — troubleshooting &amp; tuning for optimal performance</a> guide.</li>
<li>View the event on mobile using a mobile data plan. Mobile allows for all of Welcome's functionality except for joining breakouts or lounges.</li>
<li>If you are recording the event, offer a way to view the event recording.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="01G3VV399CY9SCVKPMTBYG59PH">Browser Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use an incognito/private window of the browser. This will generally disable installed extensions that could be blocking the feed.</li>
<li>Manually disable the security extension that was either installed by IT security or even pop-up blockers.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>What exactly is an integration?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome can integrate with some of your favorite CRM/marketing tools (see below) to sync registrant data between the platforms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes it easier for registrants who sign up on the integration registration page to navigate and check into Welcome, with the intent to maximize attendance at your event.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a guest registers in the integration, the guest's information will automatically be updated to include a unique link for seamless event access. This unique link can also be used as a personalized token in event reminders. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a guest registers on Welcome, the integration will catch that information and automatically transfer it over. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, the integration will check for updated attendee information on a daily basis. It will update all guests with their most up to date registration status at that time.</span></li>

<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Below are Best Practices to follow when utilizing the Splash integration with Welcome</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. It is important to embed the unique link for each individual attendee in event reminder emails. We must invoke the data that is aggregated in the custom, hidden field that we created in <strong>Step 9</strong> from the <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403292480660" target="_self">Implementation Guide</a> into the body of the email. To do this, please click "View Personalization Tags" in the "Advanced Options" section within the Editing page when designing your reminder email.</p>
<p><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402865164820/Screen_Shot_2021-06-28_at_8.22.53_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-06-28_at_8.22.53_PM.png"></p>
<p>In our example below, the tag for "Unique Link For Welcome Event" is [custom_field_20] but please note that this will be different in your Splash instance.</p>
<p><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4402865168148/Screen_Shot_2021-06-28_at_8.21.13_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-06-28_at_8.21.13_PM.png"></p>
<p>2. As a fail safe, it is best practice to include the link to the generic link to the Welcome event. You can retrieve the generic link in the Event Dashboard in Welcome. Add a custom text or html in the event email design page in Splash.</p>
<p>3. Welcome's official recommendation is that you trigger the integration <strong>1 week before the event. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the limits in the number of API calls that Splash can make in an hour, </span><strong>we recommend that you trigger the integration at least 3 hours ahead of your event</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to confirm that everyone receives their magic links. If you have more than 1500 registrants, we recommend that you trigger the integration at least 5 hours ahead of your event.</span></p>
<p>4. Please be sure to follow steps 10-13 in the <strong>specific Splash Event's settings </strong>in the <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403292480660" target="_self">Implementation Guide</a>, and not in the general "Integrations" tabs on your Splash home page. This avoids accidentally sending registrations from <strong>all </strong>of your Splash events into one Welcome Event.</p>
<p> </p><h1>Integrations - Splash - Testing Event Emails</h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Below are steps to Test event Emails in Splash after the integration has been implemented</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Configure the event reminder email to include the unique link for the Welcome Event.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fill out the Event’s registration form with a test attendee. We recommend using an email account not associated with the Zendesk domain. (In the example below, we’re using a personal gmail address)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait 5 minutes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">(Optional) Export the Splash Guests to CSV to ensure that all attendees have unique links in the “Custom Field: Unique Link for Welcome Event” column. If some attendees do not have Unique Links, contact your Welcome Customer Success Manager. Note: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Producers</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In Welcome do not get magic links for security reasons.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Send a Reminder Email to the test attendee. Its unique link should be populated in the email. Please keep in mind that this is a test email, so please do not click “Send Test”, but follow the steps below</span>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click Email in the left-hand menu bar</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either click “new email” in the “Emails” tab, or choose a template in “My Templates” (For our example below, we chose “New Email”)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design an email template that includes the unique link and the default registration link, example screenshot below. Once satisfied, click save and move onto Recipients.</span></li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add the test attendee as a recipient, either manually or by clicking “Add Quick List</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Review section, take one more look at the information and confirm everything looks good for the test. If it does, click “Send” manually at the top right of the screen. Again, it is important to follow these steps as opposed to “Send Test”, which can cause accidental emails to actual invitees.</span></li>

<h1>What Does it Look Like in a 1:1 Call</h1>
<p>1:1 calls look a lot like our lounges and breakout rooms with one special feature; the stage is still visible! This design creates a unique dynamic where you two are not only just speaking to each other but can also still participate in what's going on on the stage and commentate on it. You will still be able to engage in public chat, and you will have access to the Photo Booth feature where you and your friend can take a picture together.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://experiencewelcome.com/referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fill out the form</a> </li>
<li>Make the intro: Email <a href="mailto:referral@experiencewelcome.com">referral@experiencewelcome.com</a>, copy the person you’re referring, and make an intro to Jerry Shen. ‍</li>

</ol>
<p>If the person you refer becomes a Welcome customer, we’ll be in touch with next steps to redeem your 💰.</p>
<p>Have more questions? See our FAQ below or contact <a href="mailto:referral@experiencewelcome.com">referral@experiencewelcome.com</a> </p>
<h2>Referral Program FAQ</h2>
<h3>Who is eligible for the referral program?</h3>
<p>Anyone except Welcome Employees are eligible to submit a referral.</p>
<h3>What Qualifies as a true referral?</h3>
<p>The person you refer should have the ability and authority to make a decision about implementing Welcome at their organization.</p>
<h3>Can I refer more than one person at the same company?</h3>
<p>Yes, but it's best to refer the individual who would be the ultimate decision maker for implementing a virtual event software solution at their organization.</p>
<h3>What if two people from my company refer the same person?</h3>
<p>Yes, but it's best to refer the individual who would be the ultimate decision maker for implementing a virtual event software solution at their organization for either external or internal-facing events. This could include decision-makers in Marketing, Events Management, Internal Communications, HR or People Ops.</p>
<h3>What does the person I refer need to do after I refer them?</h3>
<p>Once we reach out by email and kick off the conversation, the person/company you refer must commit to an annual contract greater than $25,000 annually.</p>
<h3>If my referral is accepted, how will I receive payment?</h3>
<p>If your referral is accepted, we'll send you an electronic VISA card in the amount of $2,000 USD.</p><h1>Networking — troubleshooting & tuning for optimal performance</h1>
<p>If the audio and video streams for an event are coming through very slowly or cutting in and out, you are likely accessing our application behind a network security filter that is blocking or throttling connections to our media backend.</p>
<p>Network security filters could be running on: your device, a corporate firewall, your wifi access point, or a VPN you are using.</p>
<p>If you can, turning off your VPN before joining the event will generally improve the quality and reliability of the audio and video streams.</p>
<p>Our networking layer has been designed to support the strictest filtering rules we've encountered on our enterprise customers' corporate networks. Specifically, these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Block all UDP traffic except port 53 (DNS)</li>
<li>Block all TCP traffic except for ports 80 and 443 (HTTP and HTTPS respectively)</li>
<li>Network Address Translation policy is set to "symmetric"</li>
</ul>
<p>Under those conditions, our networking layer will establish a TCP connection to a media proxy server running on port 443 (HTTPS), then tunnel all audio and video data through that connection.</p>
<p>If you are a network administrator looking to optimize the event's experience for your users and reduce the bandwidth usage on your internet link, we recommend that you modify your firewall configuration to include the following rules:</p>
<pre>allow traffic on:<br>  UDP port 3478<br>  TCP and UDP ports 4700 - 5000<br>  TCP ports 3433, 5668, 5669, 6080, 6443, 8667, 9667, 30011 - 30013<br>if the destination IP matches a DNS record in one of these domains:<br>  agora.io edge.agora.io sd-rtn.com edge.sd-rtn.com</pre>

<p>With custom registration, you are now able to set up custom fields to gather more information about your registrants. Custom registration will allow you to collect specific data based on the required fields you choose to implement. All this data will be available in the attendee tab either before or after the event (in other words, this data does not live in the post-event analytics).</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4406057642004/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png" width="599" height="393"></p>

<h1 id="01G2Z03NTHF7N6S21WJ1G8KNJT"><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
<p>This article will go over instructions on how to configure Salesforce so that registrant information is sent to the Welcome platform seamlessly in real-time. This is a valuable integration to use when registrations for a Welcome Event are hosted outside of the registration process that Welcome provides, for example, a Pardot Landing Page. If you are looking for information on sending data from Welcome to Salesforce, please <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409970167444">click here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While Pardot is a valuable marketing tool to ingest attendee information into Salesforce, it is not a required piece of the technology stack to enable an integration with Welcome. The guide below will use Pardot as an example of the source of attendee data that feeds into Salesforce, but contains necessary information even if it is not being leveraged.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="01G2Z03NTJYPF5AR7CSKR1M0RS"><strong>User Permissions</strong></h2>
<p>In order to set up the integration, you will need the following user permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Producer" role in Welcome</li>
<li>A Salesforce User that permits writing and editing functions to custom fields, as well as the ability to set up and trigger Outbound Messages and Rules.</li>
<li>A Pardot Administrator (optional if Pardot is utilized)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="01G2Z03NTJFDZXWX4E4XBXEKBJ"><strong>(Optional) Creating Automation Rules and Custom Fields in Pardot </strong></h2>

<ul>
<li>Create a Prospect custom field in Pardot and sync to the Salesforce field name (lead object) named "Welcome Event Id"</li>
<li>Once a Campaign and its associated Landing Page is created, create a new automation rule with the following:
<ul>
<li>Assignment - Customize who you want the Prospect assignments to go to. This is important as Pardot will not sync with CRM (SFDC) if the Prospect is not assigned to a user. For the sake of the example, we will assign the CRM user to "Jonathan Kim"</li>
<li>Add to CRM Campaign - Select the SFDC Campaign this Prospect will sync with. Choose the status of the lead when synced with Salesforce</li>
<li>Change Prospect custom field - Select Welcome ID and input the 6 character string that represents your Welcome Event Id. This can be found on the Welcome Event Dashboard. You will need to do this for every new Welcome Event.</li>
</ul>

<li>Create a custom field in Salesforce's Campaign Member object labeled "<strong>Welcome Event Id</strong>". The field type must be a Formula. Copy and paste this formula within the Advanced Formula field in the Custom Field Definition window.

<p>Passwordless Login has arrived for attendees and speakers! This feature will allow attendees and speakers to authenticate into Welcome events using only their email.

This feature is turned on by default for all organizations, but users will still be able to set a password and authenticate the old-fashioned way if they prefer that method.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/8a8c1e0f3dc54fdebd5946a898aa3575" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Passwordless Login works very similarly to our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056999612-One-Click-Registration-Link-Guide" target="_self">one-click links</a> we currently offer through our event dashboard. How passwordless works, once a user requests to use passwordless for the event, we send an email to them containing a unique link to join the event. It's important to note that this also means these unique links will expire. To avoid confusion, please ask your producers, speakers, and attendees to familiarize themselves with the expirations below. </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Expiration details:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The link is not used for 30 minutes after being sent</li>
<li>A new passwordless unique link is requested by the user</li>
<li>The link will expire after use</li>
</ul>
<p>If you'd like to turn Passwordless Login off for your organization, you can do so by connecting with our support team for assistance. As a reminder, this feature does not stop your speakers/attendees from logging in the old-fashioned way if they prefer that. </p>

<p>Now that you have ensured your hardware and device are good let's walk through the platform together. We will go through three critical areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#h_01FN9PXTN0YV7N1TR91XV7NCHE" target="_self">Registration</a></li>
<li><a href="#h_01FN9PY997B32WKKC77DK3E0KH" target="_self">Platform Orientation</a></li>
<li><a href="#h_01EW0JZNN8YEQEF3RSWP9YDY9E" target="_self">Lounge Rooms and Breakout Rooms</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="h_01FN9PXTN0YV7N1TR91XV7NCHE">Registration</h1>
<p>The event producers will share a link with you for the event, along with the date and time. From there you will need to register. Below are the options you have and a couple of short walkthroughs.</p>
<p>Using Single Sign-on with Gmail, LinkedIn, or Outlook</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/d1cc194d7d4c47a5b4ae25f430252d16" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Using email</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/d595a7dbdd6549279c803da8c9beae2a" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Please note that you will be locked out for a 15 minute period if you <strong>input your password incorrectly 10 times</strong>. If you are having trouble registering for an event, you can ask the event producers to send you a "one-click registration link" that bypasses the need to create an account or go through this flow. Producers, please follow this <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053086291-Help-my-Attendees-Speakers-are-saying-they-can-t-get-into-the-event-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide here</a>. </p>

<h3 id="h_01FBQ44XT6ZNKJCB0ZBX1QPTWT">The Stage</h3>
<p>This is where the bulk of the event will be unless it is a multi-track event. Here you will be able to navigate to other areas of the event, adjust stage volume, and make the event go to full screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Volume slider - Located at the bottom left</li>
<li>Full Screen - Located at the bottom right</li>
<li>Closed Caption - If the event has this enabled, the CC button is at the bottom right</li>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Raise Hand</strong> - This is a feature where you can alert the producers of the event to put you on stage to ask your question on video in front of the audience. In other words, raising your hand tells the producers that you want to go on stage.
<ul>
<li>The event producers can simply choose not to acknowledge your raised hand</li>
<li>You can also just ask your questions in text form in the Q&amp;A</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="01G39YWBP2D94WQSBKYHVFMQ5X"><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
<p>This article details instructions on how to implement an integration between Salesforce and Welcome. Specifically, this guide will go over how to configure your Salesforce instance to receive data from Welcome. If you are looking for information on sending data from Salesforce to Welcome, please <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406395110164" target="_self">click here</a>.</p>
<p>The Welcome platform will create a new Campaign in Salesforce that is associated with the Event if one does not already exist. The integration will also create new Campaign Members within the Campaign.</p>
<p>Welcome will also send unique, one-click URLs for each Campaign Member in Salesforce. This can be included in email campaigns sent to registrants to click and jump into an event seamlessly. If Pardot is being leveraged with Salesforce, this guide will also go over how to send the one-click URLs back into Pardot to embed in post-registration email communication.</p>
<p>Lastly, the integration will check for updated attendee information every few hours and update all Campaign Members with their most up-to-date registration status at that time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="01G39YWBP281G5FKW7BNWM9H80"><strong>User Permissions</strong></h2>
<p>A "Producer" role in Welcome</p>
<p>A Salesforce Profile that has permission to read, write, and edit data to custom fields </p>
<p>A Pardot Administrator (optional)</p>
<p> </p>

<ul>
<li>Create a custom field under the "<strong>Campaign Member</strong>" object in Salesforce. Name the field "<strong>Unique Link for Welcome Event</strong>". Please note that this must be the exact syntax.</li>
<li>Create a custom field under the "<strong>Campaign</strong>" object in Salesforce. Name the field "<strong>Welcome Event Id</strong>". Please note that this must be the exact syntax.</li>
<li>Provide your Welcome Customer Success Manager or Sales Engineer the following:
<ul>
<li>Your company's Salesforce login URL</li>
<li>Salesforce username and password (via a secure method)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Navigate to your Welcome Event Dashboard and click on the Integrations tab. From there, click on the "Trigger Integration" button.</li>

<ul>
<li>Create a custom field under the "Lead" object in Salesforce. Name the field "<strong>Unique Link for Welcome Event</strong>".</li>
<li>Utilize Process Builder to replicate the value in the Campaign Member object to the Lead Object's custom field, "<strong>Unique Link for Welcome Event</strong>".</li>
<li>Create a custom field under Prospect in Pardot and name it "<strong>Unique Link for Welcome Event</strong>". Link this field with the Lead object's "<strong>Unique Link for Welcome Event</strong>" field. Ensure that the sync behavior has "<strong>Use Salesforce's Value</strong>" selected.</li>

</ul><h1>I Hear Audio Echoing</h1>
<p>Generally, if you are hearing echo, it means that there is a device that is channeling your audio back. This can be very distracting for your audience and finding a quick solution will help your event be successful. If you hear an audio echo or audio feedback through your speakers, there are a few possible causes and solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user has speakers loud enough for the microphone to capture the sound.
<ul>
<li>Ask the user to turn their audio down or wear headphones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A user's speakers are too close to the microphone.<br>
<ul>
<li>Ask the user to move their speakers or turn the audio down. Swapping to headphones is also an option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A user's echo cancellation is failing (can be device or computer performance issues).<br>
<ul>
<li>Ask the user to confirm their settings are correct. This fix could require a device restart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A user has a poor-quality microphone.
<ul>
<li>Ask the user to use a different audio source.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Someone has multiple instances of the event open.
<ul>
<li>Ask the user to close out one of the instances or lower the volume.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Someone is not using headphones in a small space.
<ul>
<li>Ask the user to use headphones or lower their volume.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple people in the event and also in the same location. 
<ul>
<li>Ask the users to wear headphones, lower the volume, or share a device for the event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Background noise from a speaker's environment.
<ul>
<li>Ask the user to mute when they are not speaking. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To troubleshoot this, a producer can mute active mics to find the source of the echo. Once identified, you will need to connect with the user via chat (GR or DMs is your best bet) and ask them to resolve on their end. One of the quickest fixes (and easiest ways to avoid this issue in the first place) is to ask your speakers to use headphones for the event. Please note that if your speakers switch to headphones mid-event, they may need to adjust their A/V settings and/or refresh the page; it's best to troubleshoot these issues in the Green Room whenever possible. </p>

<h2 id="01FTVQ5PR6KYDRE6NRB7M8WKP4">Things to be mindful about</h2>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>The website you are linking to will need "iframing" for it to work. Many large public websites will not have this option enabled so you won't be able to link them. You can use <a href="https://iframetester.com/">https://iframetester.com/</a> to check if your website is compatible. </li>
<li>When setting up your info tabs, please <strong>do not</strong> include HTTPS:// as it's already included in the dashboard. Including it will cause your info tabs to not work.</li>
<li>Welcome Support is <strong>not</strong> able to make changes to sites that need iframing. If the site in question is not compatible with Info Tabs, please reach out to your website developer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="01FTVQ5JGDYQ537V3P4FTF5F8X">Where to add Info Tab</h2>
<p>You can add your Info Tab information within the <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059331171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Event Dashboard's</a> "Event Details" section under the "Event Customization" section.</p>

<p>A multi-track event will allow you to have multiple concurrent stages and areas under a single landing page. This guide is intended to show you how to create, manage, and navigate multi-track events. Before you start this guide, you'll want to be familiar with the Event Dashboard, please refer back to the feature guide <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059331171">here</a> if needed.</p>
<h1 id="01FSA5D828KW3PRHJ0PVSYCR0S">Areas of Change</h1>
<h4 id="01FSA5DA5W4H40CH2R940GTYA1">Registration Page</h4>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4415800168468/multi_track_reg_clip_difference.gif" alt="multi track reg clip difference.gif" width="519" height="292"></p>
<p>The registration page will transform from a single-stage view to a multi-stage view. You'll be able to scroll down to see the different stages, along with their agendas. This allows your attendees to have a better view of the entire event from a glance.</p>
<h4 id="01FSA5DE2K2F4J448JDBJWSR37">Event Dashboard</h4>
<p>In your Event Dashboard, you will have a new section added to the left-side navigational panel that will allow you to add, delete, and manage each stage you have added.</p>
<h4 id="01FSA5DTM7T922PT2F3G5ZS61Q">Control Room</h4>
<p>In your Control Room, you will have a new navigation panel at the top left corner in the shape of a hamburger or 3 stacked lines. This panel will allow you to change between the stages. Attendees will see this navigation panel on their end as well.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4415768285332/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png" width="90" height="29"></p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new event in your organizational Dashboard.</li>
<li>Once created, scroll to the bottom of your navigational panel on the left and click "Turn into multi-track event". Note that you can only do this if your event's start time is in the future.</li>
<li>Fill out the fields for the name of the 2nd stage you want to create and click "Turn on Multi-Track". You will be able to add more stages to the navigation panel after it has been created.</li>
<li>Congrats your event is now a multi-track event and now you will see new options in your navigational panel of the Event Dashboard.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="01FS81DYNMCYNYQMTBX60VGMM7">Managing your Multi-Track Event</h1>
<p>In the newly created multi-track event you will now see the two stages that have been created in the navigation panel on the left. One is the main stage which inherits details from your Event Details. Your new stage will not inherit these details and is a blank slate for you to customize. </p>
<p>Each stage is self-contained and will have its own unique details, agenda, stage media, and streaming settings. Let's dive into each of the sections and explore what you can do.</p>
<h2 id="01FS81DYNMQMGE0GK9YD10MKNH">Stage Details</h2>
<p>You have three specific sections you can modify:</p>
<h3 id="01FS81DYNMNJB20T6MGK8N64B5">Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Event Name - The name of the event is limited to 60 characters.</li>
<li>Event Description - This is the main body of text on the event registration page. Be aware of 300 character limit, if you go beyond the limit it will interfere with the scaling of your registration page image.</li>
<li>Start and End Time - Sets the time of the event. When setting the start time you are unable to set it to a time in the past or have the end time finish before the start time.</li>
<li>Time Zone - This will set the default time zone for your event.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="01FS81DYNM9AB4KH3XZMXWX3FE">Customization</h3>
<h4 id="01FS83KWKEQGQQNH7K8H09JNQA">Spaces</h4><p>Allows editing the names of the "Spaces" that your users will be participating in.</p><ul>
<li>Auditorium - Name of the main stage.</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="01FS83MN0TH3BZMNVWRA90ZYCT">Primary/Secondary Info Tabs</h4><ul>
<li>This creates additional tabs in the event that are linked to website URLs that are then embedded into the event.</li>
<li>The website you are linking to will need "iframing" for it to work. Most large public websites will not have this option on so you won't be able to link them. You can use <a href="https://iframetester.com/">https://iframetester.com/</a> to check if your website is compatible. </li>
<li>When adding the URL please <strong>do not</strong> include HTTPS:// as it's already included. Adding this a second time will cause the page to not load.</li>
<li>Check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415025877396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Info Tab Guide</a> for complete details.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="01FS82E9QTVS78JQP741SVMFS6">Agenda</h2>
<p>You will be able to build an agenda that can be accessed within the platform for your attendees. The agenda can be found on both the landing page and within the event. The agenda will showcase time ranges, session name, and a brief description of what the session will be. Please check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404219960084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agenda Guide</a> for specific details.</p>
<h2 id="01FS82ED1GKEPDZTRPNB7N54YP">Stage Media</h2>
<p>This is the area where you will upload your media assets, it is the ideal place to upload them in bulk. You are still be able to upload assets via the Control Room if needed.</p><p>Files are sorted alphabetically from top to bottom:</p><ul>

<h2 id="01FS82EH7A29M7TKKM8TB8XE89">Streaming</h2>
<p>This section will allow you to setup up to 5 RTMP out streaming services. We have 4 built in options, Twitch, Youtube, Facebook, and Custom RTMP. You can follow our article <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058345371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streaming Out - General Guide</a> for further details.</p>
<h2 id="01FS9ZQ5HY3T2SXRRNDR1RSW7M">Adding and Removing Stages</h2>
<p>Adding a stage can be quickly done by clicking the + sign to the right of Stages in the navigational panel. This will generate a new stage below the others you have.</p>
<p>Removing a stage can be done within the "Stage Details" section of the stage at the very bottom. Simply click the red "Delete Stage" button and confirm the decision in the pop-up. Please note that you cannot delete the main stage. Also, any deleted stages are not retrievable.</p>
<h1 id="01FS81DYNNJBXQH8CF9J1CG1E7">Navigating your Multi-Track Event</h1>
<p>Now that you have generated your stages let's go over how to navigate to them in the Control Panel. To get there you can click the "Control Room" button at the top left. Click on it will generate a drop-down selection of your different stages. Select one to go to that stage's Control Room.</p>
<h2 id="01FSA025SMRGZC30P0T2RMZ36D">Multi-Track Event Navigation Panel</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4415799018900/Control_Room_Hamburger.gif" alt="Control Room Hamburger.gif" width="519" height="292"></p>
<p>Navigating the stages in the Control room behaves the same as it would for your speakers and attendees. At the top top left corner in the shape of a hamburger or three stacked lines is the button to open up the navigation panel (please see image below for an example). Within that panel you will see stages that are available. If the doors are closed for a stage it will state "Currently Closed". Attendees will not be able to go to closed stages but, speakers and producer will be able to. </p>

<p>Registration should be as simple as possible for new attendees. Welcome strives to reduce as many friction points that are possible and thus we've created the Quick Registration flow. This will ease the process of account creation for both new attendees and producers as well.</p>
<p>When Quick Registration is enabled for an event, you can use your 3rd party marketing platform to send access links to your attendees without leveraging an integration. It’s as simple as including our Quick Registration link to the form in the emails of your attendees from your preferred marketing platform. </p>
<p>Below is a demo of the normal registration flow without using quick registration.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4418016291092/Normal_Registration_Workflow.gif" alt="Normal Registration Workflow.gif" width="519" height="292"></p>
<p>Now, let's watch and see how much easier it is for an attendee to join an event with Quick Registration.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4418036600980/Quick_Registration_Workflow_Annotated.gif" alt="Quick Registration Workflow Annotated.gif" width="519" height="292"></p>
<h2 id="01FTREPD5S5H33PNVJJJR25FYF">How to Edit your Dynamic Link</h2>
<p>Our quick registration link contains dynamic fields that you will need to make sure is compatible with the marketing platform you are using. Let's break down the dynamic link and give you some examples of the commonly used platforms.</p>
<p><strong>https://app.experiencewelcome.com/events/EventID/quick_reg?email=<span class="wysiwyg-color-red">{email}</span>&amp;firstName=<span class="wysiwyg-color-red">{firstName}</span>&amp;lastName=<span class="wysiwyg-color-red">{lastName}</span></strong></p>
<p>In this example of what the dynamic link would look like, we have highlighted the dynamic areas in red. These areas are the dynamic sections and will need to be made compatible with your marketing platform. What your marketing platform will do is auto-fill in these areas for you when you send out emails to your prospective users. </p>
<p><strong>Be sure to use your platforms hyperlink functions and not simply copy and paste. In some cases you may need to manually enter them by editing the link.</strong></p>
<p>Let's go over some of the default fields of some of the more popular marketing platforms. This will not be an exhaustive list and you should always confirm with their respective resources. </p>

<h2 id="01FTREPD5S85CVFAMGB7HCAGER">How to Enable this Feature</h2>
<p>In the event dashboard, using the left panel, navigate to <em><strong>Event Details</strong></em>, scroll down to the <em><strong>Registration Flow</strong></em> section, click on the box next to <strong>Enable Quick Registration</strong>, then click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/7048936433556/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png"></p>
<h2 id="01FTRH5CWJFXR9ZCB5XGB17Z6Z">Things to be Aware of</h2>
<p>You should not add attendees whom you want to use quick registration links into the Welcome Attendees Tab, manually, via an integration, or CSV upload. <strong>This feature will NOT work for Speakers, please pre-register your speakers and send them <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056999612" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One-Click Links</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Rather, you should send out quick-registration links in emails that come from your marketing automation tool and let the attendee's action of clicking the quick registration link load them into the Welcome attendee tab automatically.</p>
<p>Quick registration links will not take over regular Welcome registrant accounts that get loaded into the Attendees Tab or those that have an existing Welcome profile. So, if a person attempts to use a quick reg link for an existing event registrant, they will be redirected to the event landing page to log in as that registrant.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, "Email Allow List" should not be used in conjunction with Quick Registration, as the two functionalities will conflict with each other.</strong></p>

</section><h1>3/25/22</h1>
<p>Welcome back for another round of updates, fixes, and features!</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>BETA:<br>
<ul>
<li>Safari support is slowly being rolled out. Previously on desktop Safari, you had a limited experience where you can just watch the stream and users might be blocked from entering the app if the stream is not spun up yet. This feature makes the desktop Safari experience like the normal desktop experience on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. The mobile experience using Safari is unchanged.
<ul>
<li>Some things to note:
<ul>
<li>The Jump In Screen now is "Click Anywhere to Jump In".</li>
<li>There is a dismissible banner directing users to use Chrome for the best experience</li>
<li>You can do everything on Safari (speak, produce, go to lounges/breakouts, etc.) except for screen share. We recommend that you still advise speakers and producers to use Chrome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quick registration allows for an easier joining experience for new attendees. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> if you'd like this enabled for your organization.</li>
<li>
<span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Anonymous Q&amp;A g</span>ives producers the ability to allow attendees to hide their names or to hide all names by default in Q&amp;A. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> if you'd like this enabled for your organization.</li>
<li>Domain deny list allows for producers to restrict registration from emails of a certain domain. Please note that this adds new behavior to sign out people who are denied entry into the event so that they can easily log in again with different credentials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Enhancements</h1>
<ul>
<li>Allow for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to be uploaded as backgrounds and overlays. You can use these files to give your event some extra pizazz with moving images. Please make sure that your SVG files follow our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053392351-Graphics-and-Video-Dimensions" target="_self">Dimension Guide</a> for the best experience. </li>
<li>Added in some recording monitoring improvements on our side.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Fixes</h1>
<ul>
<li><span class="discussion-level-1 discussion-id-f1c8aead-ae11-4b09-9f63-bf94e57741f3 notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Producers will now see a timestamp of when a scheduled reminder email was sent or when it will be sent. </span></li>
<li>Added a fix for producers sometimes getting an error registering for events.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where speakers who used a quick-reg link would automatically become attendees. Now when they use a quick-reg link they just land on the main event page to log in normally. Please note, there is no quick-reg “one-click” experience for speakers; we recommend speakers should use our standard one-click links for the best experience.</li>
<li>Added a fix for some cases where iPad users would not redirect to the mobile experience.</li>
<li>Added a fix for videos loaded into an event that would sometimes revert to a "processing" state.</li>
<li>Powered By Welcome logo
<ul>
<li>Made this logo the same color as the text in the footer.</li>
<li>Added the logo to partner events on the mobile experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h1>Screen Sharing on Chrome Windows PC</h1>
<p>Screen sharing from Chrome on a Windows PC is pretty common and with many options. You will probably either be screen sharing a slide based presentation such as Microsoft PowerPoint or something from your desktop to show off to the attendees. The purpose of this article is to walk you through how screen sharing works in Chrome and some best practices for presentation software.</p>

<h1 id="01FZBT491T7FJ707KWHBF0G4FX">How to Screen Share</h1>
<p>To start screen sharing you will need to either be inside the Green Room or in one of our Lounge/Breakout rooms. When in the those rooms you should see a button with this logo and may say "Present".</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5171588903316/Screen_Shot_2022-03-29_at_12.31.36_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2022-03-29_at_12.31.36_PM.png" width="113" height="43"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You should receive a pop up with the different screen share options for Chrome</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5172218836756/chrome_Screen_share_pop_up.png" alt="chrome_Screen_share_pop_up.png"></p>
<h2 id="01FZBT431BP213VQ6GB39Y54RG">Screen Share Options</h2>
<p>You will have 3 options to choose from</p>
<ul>
<li>Entire Screen - This will allow you to select entire desktops. If you have multiple monitors you will be given the option to select either or. You are also given the option at the bottom left to toggle on "share system audio"</li>
<li>Window - Allows you to select an open application window</li>
<li>Chrome Tab - Allows you to select an open tab in Chrome. You are also given the option at the bottom left to toggle on "share audio" for that tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on what you are trying to share the behaviors of each option may vary. </p>
<h1 id="01FZBT3ZKGQE8XPNKER3K8PRV1">Screen Sharing Slide Presentations</h1>
<p>Let's go over two of the most used slide presentation software for Windows PC. Ideally, it is best to have access to two monitors when screen sharing a presentation. One monitor would be used for the presentation and the other monitor to view the green room and chat interaction panel. If you do not have access to a secondary monitor that is ok too we will guide you with some best practices for that.</p>
<p>Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides happen to be the most popular. They both are the same but how you share them can be quite different. You will have further differences if you use only one monitor versus two.</p>
<h2 id="01FZBT4GQRYFA8SRDFH3BDKZ9W">Screen Sharing Microsoft PowerPoint</h2>
<p>This is the most popular slide presentation software used for presentations. Based on if you have one or more monitors will vary the way you setup the presentation. A two monitor setup is the most ideal since it will allow you to see both your slides and the Welcome event in full.</p>
<h3 id="01FZBT3SCR45AA5SCC8XQ5VRTB">1 Monitor</h3>
<p>In this method we will be sharing the application window within Chrome. Sadly, due to how Chrome and PowerPoint interact you may have black bar at the right and left of you screen share on the stage. <a href="#01FZBT9ZD409YC7KGV8Y8D2PDS">Google Slide</a> behaves much better than PowerPoint for 1 monitor screen sharing. The reason for this method is so the speaker can both see the presentation they are giving and the Welcome stage at the same time. It is especially good if the speaker is interested in seeing what sort of engagement is happening in the chat. </p>
<p id="01FZBSAFTQ20Z9E7G2K3M1CDWN" class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong>Video walkthrough here:</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/35b95e0e69544616ad7845e630c4788f" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First thing you want to do is resize you windows so that you can see both the presentation software and Welcome Event<img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5380510104980/Resizing_Windows_window.gif" alt="Resizing Windows window.gif"></p>
<p>In PowerPoint, click "Slide Show", then click "Set Up Slide Show"</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325837496852/power_point_slide_show_setup_PC.png" alt="power point slide show setup PC.png"></p>
<p>Select "Browsed by an individual (window)" and click OK</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5200513817236/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png"></p>
<p>While still in "Slide Show" tab, click "Play from Start" on the left</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5231693306772/PC_PowerPoint.png" alt="PC PowerPoint.png"></p>
<p>You may need to resize the PowerPoint window to be about 2/3rds of your screen (might take some trial and error here depending on your screen size)</p>
<p>Click "Present" within Welcome (it will be towards the bottom left-hand corner)</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325969990932/speaker_present_button.png" alt="speaker present button.png"></p>
<p>Choose "Application Window" tab &gt; select the PowerPoint window &gt; click "Share"</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360079104192/Screen_Shot_2020-12-09_at_8.40.39_AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-12-09_at_8.40.39_AM.png" width="492" height="420"></p>
<p>From here you may need to resize your two windows (PowerPoint and Welcome) into whatever is comfortable for you. Note that you'll still need to keep the PowerPoint window fairly big as if you try to make it smaller it will resize your presentation within the Welcome stage.</p>
<h3 id="01FZBT5J6PP4GR4E186E3SDX5B">2 Monitors</h3>
<p>This is the easiest method to manage two different windows. On monitor will contain the presentation at full screen and the 2nd monitor will contain the Welcome event window. This will also result in a cleaner presentation for PowerPoint due to using "Your Entire Screen" rather than "Application Window".</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong>Video walkthrough here:</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/69d7f0a2b24f453f9a0e5f3ba363b6a9" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">First thing you will need to do is move your presentation to one monitor and your Welcome Window to the second monitor.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">By default your presentation should go straight to full screen but if it doesn't. Within PowerPoint Click on the "Slide Show" tab, then click on "Set Up Slide Show"</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325837496852/power_point_slide_show_setup_PC.png" alt="power point slide show setup PC.png"></p>
<p>Choose "Presented by a speaker (full screen)"</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5382890279444/chrome_pc_powerpoint_full_screen.png" alt="chrome pc powerpoint full screen.png"></p>
<p>While still in "Slide Show" tab, click "Play from Start" on the left. This should make the presentation cover the whole screen.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5231693306772/PC_PowerPoint.png" alt="PC PowerPoint.png"></p>
<p>In the other monitor, Click "Present" on Welcome (it will be towards the bottom left-hand corner)</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325969990932/speaker_present_button.png" alt="speaker present button.png"></p>
<p>Choose the appropriate screen under "Your Entire Screen" tab. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360078962971/Screen_Shot_2020-12-07_at_3.36.08_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-12-07_at_3.36.08_PM.png" width="541" height="461"></p>
<p>The presentation needs to be the active window for you to change slides. Be sure the presentation is the last thing you clicked on.</p>
<h2 id="01FZBT9M1ZK8J475SR08HGHADJ">Screen Sharing Google Slides</h2>
<p>Screen sharing with Google Slides within Chrome is the easiest way and less problematic way of screen sharing a presentation. Unlike PowerPoint which requires either sharing from desktop or application window you will be sharing from a Chrome tab. This results in a cleaner and easier presentation due to Chrome and Slides being in the same Google ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="01FZBT9ZD409YC7KGV8Y8D2PDS">1 Monitor</h3>
<p>In this method we will be sharing from a Chrome tab. For 1 monitor presentations, this behaves better than if you were to use PowerPoint. You may want to consider uploading your PowerPoint presentation to Google slides and run it this way. The reason for this method is so the speaker can both see the presentation they are giving and the Welcome stage at the same time. It is especially good if the speaker is interested in seeing what sort of engagement is happening in the chat.</p>
<p id="01FZBT9M1Z46BNMXJ2X9YY35HW" class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong>Video walkthrough here:</strong></p>

<p>Have your Google Slides presentation loaded up in a separate window from Welcome. Once you have been invited and entered the Green Room, click "Present" button on the lower left-hand corner.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Choose "Chrome Tab" at the top, then your Google Slides presentation. Click "Share" to complete the process. Please note that you can check the "Share audio" check box in the bottom left if you intend to include audio in your presentation.</p>

<p>Now go to your Google Slides presentation Window. You can either go to "View" tab, then click "Slideshow". Or you can simply press "Slideshow" on the upper right-hand corner. You can then resize/move the application window to your liking while also being able to see the Welcome platform. You can use arrow keys to change slides.</p>

<h3 id="01FZBTBA8E9E3WZ8SGRVGSSM9B">2 Monitor</h3>
<p>This is the easiest method to manage two different windows. One monitor will contain the presentation  and the 2nd monitor will contain the Welcome event window. This way you don't have to worry about managing the different windows covering each other up. The biggest difference between 1 monitor and 2 monitor sharing for Google Slides is simply moving the application windows to the different monitors. The rest of the steps is exactly the same.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">First thing you will need to do is move your presentation to one monitor and your Welcome Window to the second monitor.</p>
<p>Once you have been invited and entered the Green Room, click "Present" button on the lower left-hand corner.</p>

<p>To start screen sharing you will need to either be inside the Green Room or in one of our Lounge/Breakout rooms. When in those rooms you should see a button with this logo and may say "Present".</p>

<h2 id="01FZBT431BP213VQ6GB39Y54RG">Screen Share Options</h2>
<p>You will have 3 options to choose from. Depending on what you are trying to share the behaviors of each option may vary. </p>
<ul>
<li>Entire Screen - This will allow you to select entire desktops. If you have multiple monitors you will be given the option to select either monitor.</li>
<li>Window - Allows you to select a specific open application window</li>
<li>Chrome Tab - This allows you to select an open tab in Chrome. You are also given the option at the bottom left to toggle on "share audio" for that tab.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="01FZBT3ZKGQE8XPNKER3K8PRV1">Screen Sharing Slide Presentations</h1>
<p>Let's go over the most used slide presentation software for Mac. Ideally, it is best to have access to two monitors when screen sharing a presentation. One monitor is to be used for the presentation and the other monitor is to view the green room and chat interaction panel. If you do not have access to a secondary monitor that is ok, we will guide you with some best practices for that.</p>
<p>Microsoft PowerPoint, Keynote, and Google Slides are the most frequently used presentation applications on our platform. While they are similar in function, how you share them can be quite different. On top of that, you will have further differences if you use only one monitor versus two.</p>
<h2 id="01FZBT4GQRYFA8SRDFH3BDKZ9W">Screen Sharing Microsoft PowerPoint</h2>
<p>This is the most popular slide presentation software used in presentations. Based on if you have one or more monitors will vary the way you set up the presentation. A two-monitor setup is ideal since it will allow you to see both your slides and the Welcome event in full which allows you to engage with the audience.</p>

<h2 id="01FZBT431BP213VQ6GB39Y54RG">Screen Share Options</h2>
<p>You will have 2 options to choose from</p>
<ul>
<li>Screen - This will allow you to select entire desktops. If you have multiple monitors you will be given the option to select either or. You are also given the option at the bottom left to toggle on "share system audio"</li>
<li>Window - Allows you to select an open application window</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on what you are trying to share the behaviors of each option may vary. </p>
<h1 id="01FZBT3ZKGQE8XPNKER3K8PRV1">Screen Sharing Slide Presentations</h1>
<p>Let's go over two of the most used slide presentation software for Windows PC. Ideally, it is best to have access to two monitors when screen sharing a presentation. One monitor would be used for the presentation and the other monitor to view the green room and chat interaction panel. If you do not have access to a secondary monitor that is ok too we will guide you with some best practices for that.</p>
<p>Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides happen to be the most popular. They both are the same but how you share them can be quite different. You will have further differences if you use only one monitor versus two.</p>
<h2 id="01FZBT4GQRYFA8SRDFH3BDKZ9W">Screen Sharing Microsoft PowerPoint</h2>
<p>This is the most popular slide presentation software used for presentations. Based on if you have one or more monitors will vary the way you setup the presentation. A two monitor setup is the most ideal since it will allow you to see both your slides and the Welcome event in full.</p>
<h3 id="01FZBT3SCR45AA5SCC8XQ5VRTB">1 Monitor</h3>
<p>In this method we will be sharing the application window within Chrome. Sadly, due to how Chrome and PowerPoint interact you may have black bar at the right and left of you screen share on the stage. <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5081165870356#01FZBT9ZD409YC7KGV8Y8D2PDS">Google Slide</a> behaves much better than PowerPoint for 1 monitor screen sharing. The reason for this method is so the speaker can both see the presentation they are giving and the Welcome stage at the same time. It is especially good if the speaker is interested in seeing what sort of engagement is happening in the chat. </p>

<p>First thing you want to do is resize you windows so that you can see both the presentation software and Welcome Event<img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5380510104980/Resizing_Windows_window.gif" alt="Resizing Windows window.gif"></p>
<p>In PowerPoint, click "Slide Show", then click "Set Up Slide Show"</p>

<p>You may need to resize the PowerPoint window to be about 2/3rds of your screen (might take some trial and error here depending on your screen size)</p>
<p>Click "Present" on Welcome (it will be towards the bottom left-hand corner)</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325969990932/speaker_present_button.png" alt="speaker present button.png"></p>
<p>Choose "Window or screen" drop down and select the PowerPoint window. You should see a preview of the selection.</p>

<p>From here, resize your two windows (PowerPoint and Welcome) into whatever is comfortable for you. Note that you'll still need to keep the PowerPoint window fairly big as if you try to make it smaller it will resize your presentation within the Welcome stage.</p>
<h3 id="01FZBT5J6PP4GR4E186E3SDX5B">2 Monitors</h3>
<p>This is the easiest method to manage two different windows. On monitor will contain the presentation at full screen and the 2nd monitor will contain the Welcome event window. </p>

<p>The presentation needs to be the active window for you to change slides. Be sure the presentation is the last thing you clicked on.</p>
<h2 id="01FZBT9M1ZK8J475SR08HGHADJ">Screen Sharing Google Slides</h2>
<p>You can screen share Google Slides as an application window but we would advise you to do it from Google Chrome and share it as a Chrome Tab. You can check out our <strong>Windows Chrome Guide</strong> for details.</p>
<h3 id="01FZBT9ZD409YC7KGV8Y8D2PDS">1 Monitor</h3>
<p>In this method we will be sharing the application window within Firefox. Sadly, due to how Firefox and application windows interact you may have black bar at the right and left of you screen share on the stage. The reason for this method is so the speaker can both see the presentation they are giving and the Welcome stage at the same time. It is especially good if the speaker is interested in seeing what sort of engagement is happening in the chat. </p>

<p>You can then resize/move the application window to your liking while also being able to see the Welcome platform. You can use arrow keys to change slides and use the Presenter pop out to control the presentation. This might be easier than using the presentation window..</p>

<li>Window - Allows you to select an open application window</li>
<li>Microsoft Edge Tab - Allows you to select an open tab in Edge. You are also given the option at the bottom left to toggle on "share audio" for that tab.</li>

<p>This is the easiest method to manage two different windows. On monitor will contain the presentation at full screen and the 2nd monitor will contain the Welcome event window.

<h2 id="01FZBT9M1ZK8J475SR08HGHADJ">Screen Sharing Google Slides</h2>
<p>Screen sharing with Google Slides within Edge is the easiest way and less problematic way of screen sharing a presentation compared to PowerPoint. Unlike PowerPoint which requires either sharing from desktop or application window you will be sharing from a Edge tab. This results in a cleaner and easier presentation.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/ade97a5a95854185a0949a77a3d81f32" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3 id="01FZBT9ZD409YC7KGV8Y8D2PDS">1 Monitor</h3>
<p>In this method we will be sharing a Edge tab. For 1 monitor presentation this does behave better than using PowerPoint. You may want to consider uploading your PowerPoint presentation to Google Slides and run it this way. The reason for this method is so the speaker can both see the presentation they are giving and the Welcome stage at the same time. It is especially good if the speaker is interested in seeing what sort of engagement is happening in the chat.</p>
<p>Have your Google Slides presentation loaded up in a separate window from Welcome. Once you have been invited and entered the Green Room, click "Present" button on the lower left-hand corner.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5325991724692/speaker_present_button.png" alt="speaker present button.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Choose "Microsoft Edge Tab", then your Google Slides presentation. Click "Share" to complete the process. Please note that you can check the "Share audio" check box in the bottom left if you intend to include audio in your presentation.</p>

<p>Now go to your Google Slides presentation Window. You can either go to "View" tab, then click "Slideshow". Or you can simply press "Slideshow" on the upper right-hand corner. You can then resize/move the application window to your liking while also being able to see the Welcome platform. You can use arrow keys to change slides.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5326145174292/present_button_for_google_slides.png" alt="present button for google slides.png"></p>
<h3 id="01FZBTBA8E9E3WZ8SGRVGSSM9B">2 Monitor</h3>
<p>This is the easiest method to manage two different windows. One monitor will contain the presentation  and the 2nd monitor will contain the Welcome event window. This way you don't have to worry about managing the different windows covering each other up. The biggest difference between 1 monitor and 2 monitor sharing for Google Slides is simply moving the application windows to the different monitors. The rest of the steps is exactly the same.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">First thing you will need to do is move your presentation to one monitor and your Welcome Window to the second monitor.</p>

<p>Screen sharing from Firefox on a Mac is possible, but not our recommended way to share (we recommend using <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/knowledge/articles/5081179547796/en-us?brand_id=360004517751" target="_self">Chrome</a> whenever possible). You will probably either be screen sharing a slide-based presentation such as Microsoft PowerPoint or something from your desktop to show off to the attendees.

<h1 id="01FZBT491T7FJ707KWHBF0G4FX">How to Screen Share</h1>
<p>To start screen sharing you will need to either be inside the Green Room or in one of our Lounge/Breakout rooms. When in those rooms you should see a button with this logo and may say "Present".</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5171588903316/Screen_Shot_2022-03-29_at_12.31.36_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2022-03-29_at_12.31.36_PM.png" width="113" height="43"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You should receive a pop-up under the URL bar with the different screen share options for Firefox.</p>

<h2 id="01FZBT431BP213VQ6GB39Y54RG">Screen Share Options</h2>
<p>You will have 2 options to choose from. Depending on what you are trying to share the behaviors of each option may vary. In both options, you are given the option to mute website notifications while sharing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Screen - This will allow you to select entire desktops. If you have multiple monitors you will be given the option to select either monitor. </li>
<li>Window - This allows you to select an open application window.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="01FZBT3ZKGQE8XPNKER3K8PRV1">Screen Sharing Slide Presentations</h1>
<p>Let's go over the most used slide presentation software for Mac. Ideally, it is best to have access to two monitors when screen sharing a presentation. One monitor is to be used for the presentation and the other monitor is to view the green room and chat interaction panel. If you do not have access to a secondary monitor that is ok, we will guide you with some best practices for that.</p>
<p>Microsoft PowerPoint, Keynote, and Google Slides are the most frequently used presentation applications on our platform. While they are similar in function, how you share them can be quite different. On top of that, you will have further differences if you use only one monitor versus two.</p>
<h2 id="01FZBT4GQRYFA8SRDFH3BDKZ9W">Screen Sharing Microsoft PowerPoint</h2>
<p>This is the most popular slide presentation software used in presentations. Based on if you have one or more monitors will vary the way you set up the presentation. A two-monitor setup is ideal since it will allow you to see both your slides and the Welcome event in full.</p>

<p>From here, resize your two windows (Keynote and Welcome) into whatever is comfortable for you. Keynote is much better about resizing the window and keeping the presentation at an appropriate size on the Welcome stage than your other options, so this is not as finicky on one monitor as other presentation tools. In other words, you are able to resize to almost any size screen that you find comfortable and not have resizing issues on the main stage.</p>

<p>Welcome back for another round of updates, fixes, and features!</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>Safari support is slowly being rolled out. Previously on desktop Safari, you had a limited experience where you can just watch the stream and users might be blocked from entering the app if the stream is not spun up yet. This feature makes the desktop Safari experience like the normal desktop experience on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. The mobile experience using Safari is unchanged.
<ul>
<li>Some things to note:
<ul>
<li>The Jump In Screen now is "Click Anywhere to Jump In".</li>
<li>There is a dismissible banner directing users to use Chrome for the best experience</li>
<li>You can do everything on Safari (speak, produce, go to lounges/breakouts, etc.) except for screen share. We recommend that you still advise speakers and producers to use Chrome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quick registration allows for an easier joining experience for new attendees. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> if you'd like this enabled for your organization.</li>
<li>
<span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Anonymous Q&amp;A g</span>ives producers the ability to allow attendees to hide their names or to hide all names by default in Q&amp;A. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> if you'd like this enabled for your organization.</li>
<li>Domain deny list allows for producers to restrict registration from emails of a certain domain. Please note that this adds new behavior to sign out people who are denied entry into the event so that they can easily log in again with different credentials.</li>
<li>
<strong>BETA:</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Speaker moderation gives the ability for speakers to moderate Q&amp;A when moderation is turned on. Speakers will also have the ability to delete chats from the public chat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Enhancements</h1>
<ul>
<li>Nothing of note.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Fixes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Reverting to an older version of our video provider for stability. Once our provider fixes the stability issues with the newer version we will revert back.</li>
<li>Added a fix for an issue where producers would sometimes receive an error when trying to log in to an event.</li>
<li>Added a fix for an issue where polls weren’t updating in recordings.</li>
<li>Database improvements allowing for higher overall system speed.</li>
</ul><h1>Window Sizing</h1>
<p>For the best experience on Welcome, we strongly recommend that your window size is fairly large. This is important because Welcome resizes itself according to the size of your window and depending on the size, you may experience some loss of functionality in this process. </p>
<p>This information is most important for producers as you will need an adequately sized window to control all of the functions in the control room. Attendees and Speakers should also strive to have well-sized windows as there is some resizing on Welcome's end that can impact their experience as well.</p>
<p>There are a few methods for resizing your window:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going full screen.</li>
<li>Use your browser's zoom in/out feature.</li>
<li>Resize your window by dragging the edge of the window.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that said, it's also important to find a setup that works well for you and you are comfortable with. Below is a breakdown of what we'd recommend by resizing options.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have multiple monitors or an easy method to change applications (such as the three-finger drag on Macs or the Taskbar on PCs), full screen is a great option to ensure your window is appropriately sized. If you've got screen real estate, this is the way to go as you're much less likely to run into accidental resizing issues that can impact an event.</li>
<li>If you are limited to a smaller screened device or have no second monitor, you will probably want to not go full screen and just have a larger window. With this setup, you are able to have other apps you need handy on the desktop for quick switching. Be mindful of accidentally resizing your window if you go this route though.</li>
<li>Zooming should primarily be used for more granular changes to your setup. You will still want a large window or a full-screened window to ensure that Welcome hasn't resized and functionality is being blocked.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="01G0D4D7JTEKEFW7V6C4BM3NVX"><strong>Going fullscreen</strong></h4>
<p>If you have multiple monitors, we recommend using fullscreen for the best experience whenever possible. This will allow you to have a large Welcome window and any other applications you need open (such as an internal communication tool like Slack). This will allow you to maximize your screen space and have less of a chance of resizing the window and leading to a poor experience. While in full screen, you can also utilize your browser's zoom feature for more granular resizing of the event. We recommend you stick close to 100% zoom for the best experience.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5498641306004/Untitled_design.gif" alt="Untitled_design.gif"></p>
<h4 id="01G0D4D7JTQP93C0D6PQDD5C56"><strong>Browser Zoom In/Out</strong></h4>
<p>Zooming your browser in and out can also resize Welcome. Using this you can achieve a well-sized window or make granular changes to your setup by combining this with full screen or window resizing.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5499266733460/Add_a_heading.gif" alt="Add_a_heading.gif"></p>
<h4 id="01G0D4D7JT760RMQGFVCC2N84E" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><strong>Resizing your Window by Dragging</strong></h4>
<p>If you are on one window and need to have multiple applications open, please make sure that your window is appropriately sized so as to not impact Welcome's functionality. To resize your window, just go to the edge of the window and click and drag until the window is an appropriate size. Don't forget that you can</p>

<h1>Fixes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a casing issue for SSO where Welcome will still redirect to SSO provider even if a user provides improper casing in their email domain (e.g. support@ExperienceWELCOME.com instead of support@experiencewelcome.com).</li>
</ul><h1>Translation Service Integration </h1>
<p>On Welcome, you are now able to utilize a translation service such as Wordly to add live translations to your event. Using RTMP streaming out, your event's audio will be sent to the translation service of your choice. Then, your event will receive translations from the event audio in a language of your audience's choice. This will allow you to provide a wonderful experience to your attendees no matter what language they speak.</p>
<p>Something to note, while you should be able to use any translation service you choose, please note that the translation service itself does not come with Welcome and you will need to procure it on your end. Additionally, because this feature relies on RTMP streaming out you will only be able to use it if your event's times are correctly set for the streaming service to work (this means if you are testing outside of the event's hours the service will not function). Finally, this feature is currently in beta and if you are interested in this feature please let us know at <a href="mailto:support@experience">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> to turn it on for your organization.</p>
<h2 id="01G37DVYDB04DHYV035HFG36S7">Walkthrough</h2>
<p>With that said, let's break down the process of setting up your translation service for your event.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/e4ebdeea158b417e8f9e54634e8d8c81" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a session within your translation service. Please make sure that the time and duration match that of your event.</li>
<li>Head to the "Event Details" page in your "Event Dashboard". In the Event Customization section, you will see a place to input a "Translation Service URL".</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/6323896974868/Screen_Shot_2022-05-16_at_1.59.15_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-16 at 1.59.15 PM.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>In your translation service, you will find a URL to include in this "Translation Service URL" section. For example, in Wordly you will want to include the "Attendee Shortcuts" URL. Please make sure that you <strong>do not</strong> include the https:// when pasting the link as it's already included on the Welcome side.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/6324751361172/Screen_Shot_2022-05-16_at_2.34.44_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-16 at 2.34.44 PM.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Click "Save" on this section to save the URL.</li>
<li>Next, navigate to the left panel and go to the streaming page. From here you will want to set up a custom stream by clicking "Add Stream" on the top right and selecting "Custom Stream" in the drop down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Single track event:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/6324789995156/Screen_Shot_2022-05-16_at_2.36.30_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-16 at 2.36.30 PM.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Multi-track event:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/6324803805076/Screen_Shot_2022-05-16_at_2.37.36_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-16 at 2.37.36 PM.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Back in your translation service you should be able to find a streaming URL and key (in Wordly this section is titled "Streaming Shortcuts). Take these links back to your Welcome dashboard and place them in the streaming pop-up. You should then see that your stream to the translation service is connected.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Streaming Shorcuts:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/6324921657748/Screen_Shot_2022-05-16_at_2.42.22_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-16 at 2.42.22 PM.png"></p>

<ul>
<li>In the Control Room of the event you should now see a box in the upper right corner that will feed the translations once the stream is live for the event. Please note that this can only be done within the event's timeframe.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/6325585382676/Screen_Shot_2022-05-16_at_3.03.16_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-16 at 3.03.16 PM.png"></p>
<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">To enable the translations, all you or an attendee needs to do is click the "Attend" button on this panel to enable the translations. You can also share the link you pasted in the "Translation Service URL" section with your attendees so they can open the translations in a different tab/window if they prefer.</li>

<h2 id="01GA1R50GWX4V0KB438M1SDV3T"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Agenda Builder</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agenda Builder is where you will spend most of your time getting your event organized before the event and during the event. This allows you to generate a central source of truth for your event as a producer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agenda Builder serves multiple functions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Create and manage your event agenda</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upload and organize your assets</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403236236436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stagekit</a>, allows you to create assets on the platform.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agenda Builder can be as simple and as complex as you would like it to be. This guide is going to show you how to use the basic functions. You can then use your creativity and event use case to cater towards your needs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agenda Builder is located on the left panel of the Control Room. At first glance it will be pretty bare, let’s dive in and show you how to fill it up with goodies. You will only see a session named “Unassigned Media”. This session tab will be where you can store assets that may not need to be put into a specific session such as a “Technical difficulties” background/overlay.</span></p>

<p>Agenda Builder is live for everyone to enjoy. This is a major update, it is a full revamp for both our agenda that was in the Event Dashboard and the multimedia panel in the Control Room. We have combined them both and now they are both managed in the Control Room. This new design will allow you to create your agenda, sessions, and organize your assets all in one place. Check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8439968702356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agenda Builder Guide</a> for specific details.</p>
