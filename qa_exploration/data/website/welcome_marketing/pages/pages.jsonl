For the avoidance of doubt, Disabling Code shall not mean a mechanism designed to enforce a Party’s rights under this Agreement.\n‍\n12.2 Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity.\n‍\n(a) On or before the Effective Date and thereafter upon Customer’s request, Company shall provide to Customer information pertaining to its disaster recovery/business continuity plans, policies and procedures, including, without limitation, a description of the disaster recovery/business continuity protocols designed to ensure Company’s ability to provide the Services (collectively, the “DR/BC\nPlan”). Company shall comply with the DR/BC Plan so as to reasonably ensure that the Services provided to Customer shall not be disrupted.

Check out these best practices to capture your audience's attention—and hook them from the moment you step on the virtual stage. Here's everything you need to know about planning your webinar, from developing awesome content to driving engagement during the event itself. Let's dive in!\n8 weeks out\nTypes of Webinars for Every Stage of the Customer Journey\nTwo months from your ideal launch date is the best time to kick off your content planning and strategy session. The first thing discussed during your meeting should be what type of webinar you want to host. If you're scratching your head and wondering what your options are, here are 12 types of webinars you can host at every stage of the customer journey.\nHow to Choose a Topic for Your Audience\nSome of the best content comes from listening to your audience. Narrowing down your audience's pain points and needs is the first step to creating great webinar content. Understand what they're hungry to learn and what problems they're trying to solve.\nIf you're unsure what their problems are, conduct small-scale targeted research through polls and surveys by putting your email lists and social channels to good use. (Pro tip: Try LinkedIn's\npolling feature\nto gauge your audience's interests quickly.) You can even narrow your inquiries with event registrants—or ask your audience about a finer point live during the event!\nWorking from a broad topic to a narrow, audience-centered hook is often helpful. For instance, you might start with \"Webinar Best Practices\" and narrow it down to \"Double Your Webinar Conversion Rate!\" That is, as long as you can deliver on that promise. ;)\nTypical broad topics include:\nHow to solve common problems\nInsider industry know-how\nHow to learn a specific skill or understand a relevant new trend\nProduct deep dives\nTips for Choosing an Engaging Speaker\nYou don't want to grab any old speaker for your webinar. You need someone who can engage an audience and provide insights into their industry so they'll be interested in what you have to say!\nResearch\nshows that people form impressions about a speaker's competence in as little as 30 seconds. This means in less than a minute; attendees will decide whether your speaker is trustworthy and judge them based on their body language and vocal attributes.\nLook at these traits before deciding on a potential guest:\nKnowledgeable:\nThis person should know more than enough about the topic and keep up with trends within it.\nDynamic:\nThey should be able to deliver engaging content from the start till finish and add some sparkle where needed, like humor or creativity.\nCredible:\nEnsure this person is credible on the topic they're presenting so that attendees will trust what they're saying.\nConfident:\nThis person should be able to give the appearance of confidence and competence. Making eye contact, keeping an open posture, using gestures to reinforce key points, varying their pace as they speak, and not over-using filler words are just some characteristics of a confident speaker.\nWhile we all want to cultivate partnerships with like-minded brands to nab incredible webinar speakers, don't discount your team's expertise. Sometimes relevance and depth are better than an instantly recognizable name—especially if you have a topic bound to draw in registrants. (Remember the importance of credibility?)\nDevelop Supporting Content\nNurture your webinar leads by offering supporting content to engage with attendees during and after the event. Content could include downloadable assets (like guides) and the next event's invitations sent through email, social channels, or directly within the webinar itself.\n3-4 Weeks Out:\nTarget Your Audience\nWebinars are all about your audience, what they want to learn and how you can help. So make sure the copy in any email outreach or announcement reflects them.\nRemember to target the job titles, companies, or prospects who will benefit most from your content. Keep in mind the more you can personalize your invites with information you already know about them, the better your conversation rate will be.\nFind the Right Email Cadence\nNearly\n60%\nof webinar registrations come from email campaigns, so it's important to get it right. At a minimum, you'll need to send the following:\nA webinar outreach email\nA registration confirmation email\nAn event reminder (or three)\nA \"Thank you\" message\nA follow-up message with the webinar recording and any other assets you've prepared for attendees\nKeep an Eye on Registration Numbers\nTracking your campaign progress is a key part of successfully running a webinar. Understand if you're hitting your registration goals, and keep in mind that 54% of all webinar attendees sign up a week before you go live, so remember that last-minute push!\nIf your numbers are lower than you'd like, shake it up! Tweak your messaging or change your promotional channels. Small changes, like reducing fields on the registration form or asking a brand partner to conduct outreach, can make a big difference in webinar attendance.\nNeed more tips on webinar registration? Check out our article,\n\"How to Boost Registrations and Attendance To Your Webinars,\"\nfor expert ideas.\nPrep Your Speakers\nEnsure your guest speakers are prepped, ready, and comfortable in your\nvirtual green room\n. The more thoroughly speakers understand the run-of-show, the more relaxed and engaging they'll be during your presentation.\nPlanning a webinar? Download our\nFree Webinar Planning Template\nso you don’t miss a thing on your to-do list!\n‍\nHow to Promote a Webinar\nA question that gets asked often is, \"\nHow do I increase registrations to my webinar and get people to show up?\n\"\nHere are five tips to boost your webinar's registration.\nOptimize Your Webinar Registration Form\nOne key element often overlooked is the webinar registration form. It's the gateway to your virtual event, so show it some love. So what makes an optimized registration form?\nKeep it short\n. When it comes to form fields, less is more. According to\nHubSpot\n, the optimal number of fields to have are three. It's a balancing act between business needs and user experience, but gathering the least amount of information possible will reduce drop-off.\nUse smart fields.\nA great feature of marketing automation platforms like HubSpot is\nsmart fields\n. They keep your leads from doing unnecessary work by removing form fields previously submitted by a customer or prospect.\nDesign using a single-column layout\n. A single-column layout has\nbeen proven\nmore effective in driving conversions than multiple columns on the same page. They offer better flow, resulting in better UX.\nOptimize for mobile.\nDon't forget about mobile-friendly design when creating your form. Make form fields and submit buttons finger size (generally 44x44 is the best size). Limit the typing needed by using dropdown menus, radio buttons, auto-selected answers, and easy-to-read fonts.\nUse Quick Registration Links.\nIncluding Welcome's Quick Registration link in your promo emails, invitees can access your webinar via the link provided without filling out another form.\nAdd CTAs to Unexpected Areas\nOn average, up to 57% of webinar registrations come from email. It's a given that you'll add call-to-action buttons to email invites and social posts, but here are several other areas to add CTAs:\nAdd a CTA banner to your website\nLink a CTA to your email signatures\nPromote through your newsletters\nAdd a CTA for your next event during your current webinar\nMake sure to take stock of all your digital assets and think of innovative ways to get your message out.\nBuild a Virtual Events Page\nIf you consistently host webinars and other virtual events, it's important to have a designated events page where visitors can find all upcoming webinars and on-demand videos. Like Welcome's\nevent page\n, yours can serve as a repository for all your future planned events and enable you to capture new signups that may not already be in your marketing database. Better yet, by adding your past events as gated on-demand videos to the events page, you can continue to increase viewership long after the webinar wraps.\nPromote Your Event Up Until Showtime\nIf you want to ensure your webinar has a good turnout, it's critical that you keep promoting in the lead-up. While two weeks is standard practice to begin pre-event promotion, a whopping 29% of people register on the same day as their event. So keep spreading the word across all your marketing channels; fingers crossed, they'll quickly fill up with eager participants!\nAdd Partnerships to Your Webinar Strategy\nWant to take your promotion efforts twofold? Partnering up with like-minded brands will bring you even closer to success. Co-hosting a webinar is the perfect way for both businesses involved - plus, having twice as many people promoting it can boost those registrant numbers. Just ensure that expectations are managed and agreed upon— like who will get which pieces of the registrant list and emails, if a recording is shared in both channels, and when you send out those social media posts. It's best to avoid having surprises pop up to get the most out of each other's time and effort!\n‍\nHow to Boost Your Webinar's Attendance\nHalf the battle is getting people to sign up for your webinar; now, you need them to show up! Here are five tips to boost your webinar attendance.\nHost During Optimal Times and Days\nWhen you're planning a webinar, timing is everything. Aim to host your webinars mid-week and avoid Mondays and Fridays. Thursday reigns supreme as the most popular day for attending virtual events (\n26%\n), followed by Tuesdays (\n23%)\nand Wednesdays (\n21%\n). And when should your event start? Mid-morning seems to be preferred by\n28%\nof viewers, with\n27%\npreferring mid-afternoon – so aim for those time slots between Tuesday and Thursday!\nUse Email Reminders to Keep in Touch\nYou've worked hard to get people signed up for your upcoming webinar - and you don't want it to become a distant memory! Establish an email sequence that subtly reminds attendees of what's coming & why it matters. Don't overwhelm them with too many messages, or you might tempt them to hit unsubscribe; three reminders should do the trick.\nThe complete email cadence can look like this:\nPost-registration follow-up confirmation email\nFirst reminder: Sent 1 week from the webinar\nSecond reminder: Sent 1 day before the webinar\nThird reminder: Sent 1 hour before the webinar\nOn-the-fence reminder: Send your final promotional email on the day of the webinar to people who've opened previous emails but did not register\nFirst follow-up: \"Here's your recording!\"\nSecond follow-up: \"Additional resources\"\nThird follow-up: \"Future events\"\nDon't Forget About On-Demand Recordings\nEven when the curtain drops on your live event, remember those audience members who prefer to consume content at their own pace. People tend to be more engaged and interested in recordings they can watch whenever they like - so seize the opportunity. Not only will you increase headcount overall, but around\n30%\nof signups come from people watching the recorded version. In other words, if you make it available, people will attend.\nIncentivize Attendance\nTry taking some cues from the event world and start gifting to drive attendance. Like you would use swag for trade shows and industry event booths, gifts can also be integrated into virtual events, as evidenced by a 60% attendance rate Lessonly achieved when they sent Starbucks gift cards for a virtual coffee chat.\nEven though giveaways add to your bottom line, sending eGifts can be one of the most impactful things you can do to boost attendance.\nAlways Add Value to Keep Attendees Coming Back\nIt's more than just having the best webinar platform - it takes great content to draw people back in. If you want future visitors, prioritize actionable and educational content that provides valuable insights instead of turning your event into a big sales pitch! Up to 40% of return visitors have been reported by those who offer real value through their presentations – so give them what they need with tips, tricks & best practices galore.\nSignup for the newsletter\nStay up to date\nThank you!\n‍\nYour submission has been received!\nOops!

Check out our list of innovative engagement ideas – guaranteed to have your attendees interacting, energized, and engaged!\nStart Strong From The Get Go\nSet the stage for a successful webinar by kicking off in high gear. Think about it like previews in a movie theatre - wouldn't everyone rather sit down and watch something fun than wait around? Build excitement with virtual games, pre-recorded hype videos, or even pub quizzes on your chosen topic – all designed to get things rolling right away!\nChoose a Stellar Speaker\nYour speaker is key to making your webinar captivating. Of course, they need to offer valuable insights about their trade - but that can only go so far.\nHow\nthey deliver these facts is equally as crucial: body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions must all play into their performance for people to fully engage. Plus, let us not forget those delightful stories of personal journeys sprinkled throughout the presentation; nothing quite warms hearts like an accompanying narrative!\nDitch the Slide Deck\nInstead of presenting run-of-the-mill slides, punch up your presentation with graphic overlays. Forget PowerPoint! Branded graphics are your perfect companion for introducing a new wow factor into virtual events. With overlays, you can keep your presentation content minimal yet super effective while keeping everyone's attention focused on YOU - not endless slides they have to read through (zzzzz).\nPro Tip: Don't have a graphic designer? Don't worry. With a bevy of engagement features and minimal design knowledge required, anyone on your team can create an unforgettable branded event with\nAgenda Builder\nand\nStage Kit\n! Cut down on overwhelm by ditching slides crammed full of text in favor of concise speeches that deliver all the info - no more zoning out for attendees!\nBring Attendees on Stage\nFoster a dynamic dialogue by inviting attendees on stage for Q&A. Instead of answering questions in the traditional one-directional manner, make it more personal with an interactive Q&A session. Get rid of the feeling that attendees are just being talked at by inviting audience members on stage to ask their burning questions face-to-face. Show them you genuinely care about what they take away from the event. After all, connection is key when trying to engage participants!\nMix up the Format\nKeep your audience from running off with their attention spans by switching up the format throughout your webinar. You can include exciting visuals such as videos or polls and get everyone involved through engaging activities like breakout rooms or an on-stage Q&A session. With this much variety at hand, you'll be holding onto the click of interest for hours rather than minutes!\nAs a best practice, avoid speaking for longer than 15 minutes without changing the format slightly.\nCaptivate Through Your Content\nKeep attendees engaged with captivating content that isn't heavy-handed on the sales pitch - let their problems drive you towards highlighting how your product or service provides the best solution instead of pushing it down their throats. Use CTA overlays or the Chat Box to sprinkle in some free resources.\n‍\nHow to Repurpose Webinar Content\nMany companies invest in creating a seemingly endless stream of content — often to little avail. But fret not! Quality will always beat quantity: instead of pushing more and more articles into the interwebs, repurpose your existing events materials; this way, you're guaranteed high-quality output without stretching resources too thin. Here are some creative solutions so that every team—big or small—can make it work.\nCreate Short-Form Content\nWith webinars being a virtual goldmine for rich, power-packed social media content - from video clips to infographics and insights, it's an amazing opportunity to give your brand marketing & outreach efforts the edge.\nWelcome is doing this by creating powerful mini-videos with great visuals that increase our events' engagement and keep all our channels synced up.\nWelcome\n4,384 followers\n2mo\nEdited\nInterested in uniting your sale and marketing teams?

It's like hitting three birds with one stone!\nTurn Audio into a Podcast\nDon't just stick to video content when it comes to your virtual event - audio recordings can also become valuable assets! Turn them into a full podcast episode or short sound clips, and you'll have a low-cost way of engaging with people through sound. Not only that, but you get the chance for even more creative storytelling opportunities too – who said podcasts don't need visuals?!\nBuild an On-Demand Video Library\n30% of event registrants\nprefer to watch webinar content after the live event. For a content marketer, this is an exciting equation. You can support these needs with an on-demand video library of all your event content.\nNot only can you improve your SEO with a landing page for each video, but landing pages with embedded forms or strong CTAs can also\nhelp your sales team capture more leads\n.\nPitch to an Industry Blog\nIt's time to expand your reach! Already an expert on the topic of your webinar? It's pitch-perfect for you to explore additional outlets and become a thought leader. Try pitching relevant opinion pages or industry blogs so that more readers can benefit from your expertise. The potential upside is immense - increased brand awareness, and solidified status as a thought-leader extraordinaire.\nCase Studies, Ebooks, and Other Major Assets\nWith some additional research and content strategy elbow grease, you could create:\nRelated blog content and a pillar page\n. Is your webinar content integral to your business model? Begin to own SEO on a specific search term by creating a\ntopic cluster\nof related blog posts and a longer\npillar page\n. Not only will this increase your organic traffic, but it will also bolster your brand's position as an expert in the space.\nA customer case study\n. Showcase how a customer or client uses your product to solve the challenges from your webinar with a customer case study. Case studies are great bottom-of-the-funnel content and can help boost product demonstration conversions or sales!\nA white paper\n. Dive deeper into the research related to your webinar topic to demonstrate your brand's understanding of related challenges and opportunities in your industry. While white papers are a bigger commitment in terms of time and resources, they can also be incredible assets for capturing leads or closing sales.\nUse event analytics and audience questions to develop new content and event ideas\nNot sure what to write about for your next blog post or your next topic for the upcoming webinar? Let event analytics and audience questions lead you in a new direction. Look at poll responses to understand what's top-of-mind with your viewers, and use that data to create new content or future webinars. On the flip side, look through those same analytics - watching where people are tuning out during live events or video replays. Take this information back in time and make tweaks, so everyone stays intrigued until (and even after) all eyes have left the screen!\nHow to Nurture Leads After a Webinar\nYour webinar was a hit - the chat was fire, and your Live Q&A session was fun and lively! So what do you do next to convert those viewers into motivated buyers? We have some tried-and-true tips for turning qualified leads into sales that enable success across teams.\nEmbed CTAs Into Your Presentation\nTo keep your buyers on the journey, you need to inspire them to act. Drive quality leads straight into sales by enchanting them with engaging webinar content and captivating CTAs. Your virtual event shouldn't just be informative; make sure it moves prospects along in that all-important sales funnel.\nA strong CTA will:\nCreate a sense of scarcity (like a limited-time offer or a two-for-one deal),\nor\nProvide your webinar attendees with something they\nreally\nwant (like your one-of-a-kind spreadsheet template or a product demo that makes their purchasing decision that much easier)\nAnd a great CTA might achieve both goals!\nConduct a Survey Before Attendees Leave\nTake advantage of the momentum and positive engagement by launching a\npost-event survey\nwithin Welcome. Conducting surveys before attendees leave the webinar, gives you valuable insight from your prospects about their buying intent—without having to wait for responses. Use that data to shape a winning strategy for sales success down the line.\nDon't risk attendees skipping over an email in their inbox one week later. Pose your most important questions as attendees head out the door, then integrate your survey responses into your customer relationship management (CRM) software to make demo and sales calls that much easier.\nFollow Up with Additional Content\nYour after-event outreach should be armed with more than just a thank you email—to give prospects an extra nudge towards conversion, include sales enabling assets too. From product feature breakdowns to checklists and templates, having marketing materials on hand can help start conversations between leads and your sales team for easier engagement down the line. Don't forget to share which files are being accessed so your sales team is in the loop and has an easy conversation starter with the prospect.\nMaximize Sales Conversations with CRM Integrations\nGive your sales team the perfect head start with integrations that capture attendee engagement, such as Q&A questions, polls they respond to, any assets they downloaded during the event, if they filled out a demo form, and other sales indicators. Your reps won't need fly-by introductions when hopping into calls; they'll be able to pick up a conversation right where your lead left off.\nCreate a Nurture Campaign\nNot all of your attendees are necessarily ready to take the plunge and book that product demo or commit to buying. To keep them interested until they're ready for more, provide helpful tips & tricks, engaging educational content, customer reviews, and case studies.\nWith an integrated CRM you'll have extensive insights into what drives engagement among attendees, so use those details to send more targeted content in your nurture campaign.\nWhether you send free assets or encourage leads to sign up for additional webinars, don't discount the power of a nurture campaign to build trust and confidence in your brand—and set your sales team up for future success.\nHow to Measure ROI of a Webinar\nIf measuring webinar ROI is challenging for your team, you're not alone.\n64% of B2B marketers\nsay their ability to demonstrate the value of their content marketing efforts is only average—or worse. You've put in a ton of hard work and dedication to ensure your webinars are well-attended, but it can still be challenging to prove their ROI without a solid foundation for analysis. By monitoring the right metrics, you'll have enough data evidence to show just how valuable these events are. From measuring lead quality, and attributing sales back to your efforts - getting those real returns won't seem like so much smoke and mirrors.\nHere are the four strategies you should implement to demonstrate the ROI of your webinars and virtual events:\nTrack the Source of Registrations\nIdentifying the channels that effectively bring in registrants for webinars is crucial to ensuring your marketing dollars are well-spent.\nUTM tracking codes\nare snippets of code in URLs that track which channel was the most effective in reaching—and converting—webinar registrants. With a bit of tracking-code sleuthing, you can find out exactly where your money was put best and plan accordingly. Make sure no URLs slip through the cracks so these cleverly crafted snippets do their job right!\nHosting a webinar comes with budget considerations, and no matter what size operation you're running, it's important to ensure every dollar is accounted for. Expenses can include:\nAdvertising costs, like paid ads or media.\nBoosting a Facebook post\nRunning a LinkedIn campaign\nSponsoring a blog post on a partner's website\nProduction costs also add up quickly. Here are a few to consider:\nDid you hire a graphic designer to make flawless slides?\nA video editor to help with post-production for on-demand services?\nEngage a production agency to help you manage run-of-show?\nThankfully,\nWelcome\ncan consolidate production costs. With in-platform tools for designing, editing, and hosting virtual events, we offer B2B marketers one way to save $$$ —and boost their ROI for every event.\nDetermine Lead Quality\nOne of the benefits of holding webinars is\ngenerating qualified leads\n. As soon as a lead registers for your event, you receive key details, including where they work or their role at a specific company. Depending on your webinar content, you'll also know where they are in their\ncustomer journey\n.\nAdditional metrics help to determine the overall quality of the leads generated from each webinar. These metrics include:\nEngagement\n.\nHow engaged was your lead\nin responding to polls during the webinar? Did they ask a question during Live Q&A? Are they still opening and clicking on your promotional emails now that the webinar is over? And, most importantly, did they click on your call-to-action at the end of the event?\nContent assets downloaded.\nDownloading assets would typically be considered a \"soft\" KPI. But this is still integral information for your sales team to have—and for you to assess the success of any content supporting your webinar topic. You may even wish to assign more lead score points for downloading a \"high intent\" piece of content, like a comparison or pricing sheet.\nDemo requests.\nHow many leads requested a product demo after attending your webinar?\nMeetings booked.\nHow many leads requested a sales call or meeting after attending your webinar?\nOverall lead score.\nWhile every company generates\nlead scores\ndifferently, all the actions a lead takes before, during, and after a webinar can help you determine where they fall in the buyer's journey and how likely they are to become a customer. How many high-scoring leads does each of your webinars generate?\nThe more qualified leads you hand over to the sales team, the more valuable your event content is.\nSales and Revenue Attribution\nYou can see exactly how your event impacted the deal cycle with proper tracking.\nThrough the Welcome/Salesforce integration, you can see how your attendees are moving through the funnel post-event. To do this, track the following\nNet new pipeline from every virtual event\nThe number of closed-won opportunities from each webinar\nAnd the total amount of closed-won revenue generated by your webinars\nWith data like this, you'll never scramble to prove webinar ROI again!\nExperience\nWelcome\nA webinar platform designed for marketers to host jaw-dropping experiences that drive revenue.\nRequest a demo"}

This does not prevent the Parties from including the standard contractual clauses laid down in these Clauses in a wider contract and/or to add other clauses or additional safeguards, provided that they do not contradict, directly or indirectly, these Clauses or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects.\n(b) These Clauses are without prejudice to obligations to which the data exporter is subject by virtue of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n‍\nClause 3\n‍\nThird-party beneficiaries\n(a) Data subjects may invoke and enforce these Clauses, as third-party beneficiaries, against the data exporter and/or data importer, with the following exceptions:\n(i) Clause 1, Clause 2, Clause 3, Clause 6, Clause 7;\n(ii) Clause 8.1(b), 8.9(a), (c), (d) and (e);\n(iii) Clause 9(a), (c), (d) and (e);\n(iv) Clause 12(a), (d) and (f);\n(v) Clause 13;\n(vi) Clause 15.1(c), (d) and (e);\n(vii) Clause 16(e);\n(viii) Clause 18(a) and (b).\n(b) Paragraph (a) is without prejudice to rights of data subjects under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\nClause 4\nInterpretation\n‍\n(a) Where these Clauses use terms that are defined in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, those terms shall have the same meaning as in that Regulation.\n(b) These Clauses shall be read and interpreted in the light of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n(c) These Clauses shall not be interpreted in a way that conflicts with rights and obligations provided for in Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n‍\nClause 5\nHierarchy\n‍\nIn the event of a contradiction between these Clauses and the provisions of related agreements between the Parties, existing at the time these Clauses are agreed or entered into thereafter, these Clauses shall prevail.\n‍\nClause 6\nDescription of the transfer(s)\n‍\nThe details of the transfer(s), and in particular the categories of personal data that are transferred and the purpose(s) for which they are transferred, are specified in Annex I.B.\nClause 7 – Optional\n‍\nSECTION II – OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES\nClause 8\nData protection safeguards\nThe data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.\n8.1   Instructions\n(a)\nThe data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.\n(b) The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.\n8.2   Purpose limitation\nThe data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.\n8.3   Transparency\nOn request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n8.4   Accuracy\nIf the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.\n8.5   Duration of processing and erasure or return of data\nProcessing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).\n8.6   Security of processing\n(a) The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.\n(b) The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.\n(c) In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.\n(d) The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.\n8.7   Sensitive data\nWhere the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.\n8.8   Onward transfers\nThe data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union () (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward transfer’) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:\n(i) the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;\n(ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;\n(iii) the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or\n(iv) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.\nAny onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.\n8.9   Documentation and compliance\n(a) The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the processing under these Clauses.\n(b) The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.\n(c) The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter’s request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.\n(d) The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.\n(e) The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.\nClause 9\nUse of sub-processors\n(a) The data importer has the data exporter’s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least thirty (30) days in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.\n(b) Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects. () The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.\n(c) The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter’s request, a copy of such a sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the data exporter. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.\n(d) The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations under its contract with the data importer. The data importer shall notify the data exporter of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract.\n(e) The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby – in the event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent – the data exporter shall have the right to terminate the sub-processor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.\nClause 10\nData subject rights\n(a)\nThe data importer shall promptly notify the data exporter of any request it has received from a data subject. It shall not respond to that request itself unless it has been authorised to do so by the data exporter.\n(b) The data importer shall assist the data exporter in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects’ requests for the exercise of their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In this regard, the Parties shall set out in Annex II the appropriate technical and organisational measures, taking into account the nature of the processing, by which the assistance shall be provided, as well as the scope and the extent of the assistance required.\n(c) In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the instructions from the data exporter.\nClause 11\nRedress\n(a) The data importer shall inform data subjects in a transparent and easily accessible format, through individual notice or on its website, of a contact point authorised to handle complaints. It shall deal promptly with any complaints it receives from a data subject.\n(b) In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these Clauses, that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a timely fashion. The Parties shall keep each other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate, cooperate in resolving them.\n(c) Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer shall accept the decision of the data subject to:\n(i) lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the Member State of his/her habitual residence or place of work, or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13;\n(ii) refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.\n(d) The Parties accept that the data subject may be represented by a not-for-profit body, organisation or association under the conditions set out in Article 80(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n(e) The data importer shall abide by a decision that is binding under the applicable EU or Member State law.\n(f) The data importer agrees that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice his/her substantive and procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with applicable laws.\nClause 12\nLiability\n(a) Each Party shall be liable to the other Party/ies for any damages it causes the other Party/ies by any breach of these Clauses.\n(b) The data importer shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data importer or its sub-processor causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses.\n(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the data exporter shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data exporter or the data importer (or its sub-processor) causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses. This is without prejudice to the liability of the data exporter and, where the data exporter is a processor acting on behalf of a controller, to the liability of the controller under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as applicable.\n(d) The Parties agree that if the data exporter is held liable under paragraph (c) for damages caused by the data importer (or its sub-processor), it shall be entitled to claim back from the data importer that part of the compensation corresponding to the data importer’s responsibility for the damage.\n(e) Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to the data subject as a result of a breach of these Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally liable and the data subject is entitled to bring an action in court against any of these Parties.\n(f) The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable under paragraph (e), it shall be entitled to claim back from the other Party/ies that part of the compensation corresponding to its/their responsibility for the damage.\n(g) The data importer may not invoke the conduct of a sub-processor to avoid its own liability.\nClause 13\nSupervision\nWhere the data exporter is established in an EU Member State:] The supervisory authority with responsibility for ensuring compliance by the data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards the data transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.\nWhere the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) and has appointed a representative pursuant to Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:] The supervisory authority of the Member State in which the representative within the meaning of Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is established, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.\nWhere the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) without however having to appoint a representative pursuant to Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:] The supervisory authority of one of the Member States in which the data subjects whose personal data is transferred under these Clauses in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are located, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.\n(b) The data importer agrees to submit itself to the jurisdiction of and cooperate with the competent supervisory authority in any procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer agrees to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory authority, including remedial and compensatory measures. It shall provide the supervisory authority with written confirmation that the necessary actions have been taken.\nSECTION III – LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES\nClause 14\nLocal laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses\n(a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.\n(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:\n(i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;\n(ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards ();\n(iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.\n(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.\n(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.\n(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).\n(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.\nClause 15\nObligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities\n15.1   Notification\n(a) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:\n(i) receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or\n(ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.\n(b) If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.\n(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).\n(d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.\n(e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.\n15.2   Review of legality and data minimisation\n(a) The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).\n(b) The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.\n(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.\nSECTION IV – FINAL PROVISIONS\nClause 16\nNon-compliance with the Clauses and termination\n(a) The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.\n(b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).\n(c) The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:\n(i) the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;\n(ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or\n(iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.\nIn these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.\n(d) Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data. The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.\n(e) Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\nClause 17\nGoverning law\nThese Clauses shall be governed by the law of the EU Member State in which the data exporter is established. Where such law does not allow for third-party beneficiary rights, they shall be governed by the law of another EU Member State that does allow for third-party beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that this shall be the law of Ireland.\nClause 18\nChoice of forum and jurisdiction\n(a) Any dispute arising from these Clauses shall be resolved by the courts of an EU Member State.\n(b) The Parties agree that those shall be the courts of Ireland.\n(c) A data subject may also bring legal proceedings against the data exporter and/or data importer before the courts of the Member State in which he/she has his/her habitual residence.\n(d) The Parties agree to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of such courts.\nAPPENDIX\nANNEX I\nA.   LIST OF PARTIES\nData exporter(s):\nName:\nThe entity identified as “Customer” in the Agreement.\nAddress:\nThe address for Customer specified in the Agreement.\nContact person’s name, position and contact details:\nThe contact details specified in the Agreement\nActivities relevant to the data transferred under these Clauses:\nCustomer’s use of the Services provided by the data importer pursuant to the Agreement.\nSignature and date:\nBy executing the Agreement, the data exporter will be deemed to have signed this Annex I.\nRole (controller/processor):\nController\nData importer(s):\nName:\nGather Wholesale, Inc.

Barranca Ave\n#8588\nCovina, CA 91723\nContact person’s name, position and contact details:\nJonathan Kim, Solutions Engineer, jonathan@experiencewelcome.com\nActivities relevant to the data transferred under these Clauses:\nProvision of the Services to the data exporter pursuant to the Agreement.\nSignature and date:\nBy executing the Agreement, the data exporter will be deemed to have signed this Annex I.\nRole (controller/processor):\nProcessor.\nB.   DESCRIPTION OF TRANSFER\nCategories of data subjects whose personal data is transferred\nThe Categories of Data subjects are specified in Schedule 1 to the DPA.\nCategories of personal data transferred\nThe categories of personal data transferred are described in Schedule 1 to the DPA.\nSensitive data transferred (if applicable) and applied restrictions or safeguards that fully take into consideration the nature of the data and the risks involved, such as for instance strict purpose limitation, access restrictions (including access only for staff having followed specialised training), keeping a record of access to the data, restrictions for onward transfers or additional security measures.\nSpecial categories of Personal Data transferred, if any, are described in Schedule 1 to the DPA.  The safeguards applied to such Personal Data are described in Schedule 2 to the DPA.\nThe frequency of the transfer (e.g. whether the data is transferred on a one-off or continuous basis).\nPersonal Data may be transferred on a continuous basis during the Term of the Agreement.\nNature of the processing\nThe nature of the processing is the data importer’s performance of the Services under the Agreement, including for the purposes of: (a) setting up, operating, monitoring, and providing the Services; (b) communicating with Users; and (d) executing other agreed-upon written instructions of the data exporter.\nPurpose(s) of the data transfer and further processing\nThe purpose of the data transfer and further processing is the data importer’s performance of the Services under the Agreement\nThe period for which the personal data will be retained, or, if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period\nPersonal Data will be retained for the duration of the Agreement and subject to Section 7 (Return or Deletion of Personal Data) of the DPA\nFor transfers to (sub-) processors, also specify subject matter, nature and duration of the processing\nThe subject matter, nature, and duration of processing undertaken by sub-processors will be the same as set forth in this Annex 1.B with respect to the data importer.\nC.   COMPETENT SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY\nIdentify the competent supervisory authority/ies in accordance with Clause 13\nThe competent supervisory authority will be the supervisory authority that has supervision over the data exporter in accordance with Clause 13.\nANNEX II\nTECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF THE DATA\nThe technical and organizational measures adopted by the data importer are set forth in Schedule 2 to the DPA.\n-----------------\nWhere the data exporter is a processor subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 acting on behalf of a Union institution or body as controller, reliance on these Clauses when engaging another processor (sub-processing) not subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 also ensures compliance with Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39), to the extent these Clauses and the data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor pursuant to Article 29(3) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 are aligned. This will in particular be the case where the controller and processor rely on the standard contractual clauses included in Decision 2021/915.\nThe Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union’s internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose of these Clauses.\nThis requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor acceding to these Clauses under the appropriate Module, in accordance with Clause 7.\nAs regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with these Clauses, different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment. Such elements may include relevant and documented practical experience with prior instances of requests for disclosure from public authorities, or the absence of such requests, covering a sufficiently representative time-frame. This refers in particular to internal records or other documentation, drawn up on a continuous basis in accordance with due diligence and certified at senior management level, provided that this information can be lawfully shared with third parties. Where this practical experience is relied upon to conclude that the data importer will not be prevented from complying with these Clauses, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective elements, and it is for the Parties to consider carefully whether these elements together carry sufficient weight, in terms of their reliability and representativeness, to support this conclusion. In particular, the Parties have to take into account whether their practical experience is corroborated and not contradicted by publicly available or otherwise accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence of requests within the same sector and/or the application of the law in practice, such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies.\n‍"}
