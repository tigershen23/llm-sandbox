<h1>1:1 Call Guide</h1>
<p>1:1 Calls are supported in Welcome; you can attend jaw-dropping events and still chat with a new friend on the same platform. We want to make sure you are still connected to the event so you will have a picture in picture of the stage. This way, you can still have a close personal interaction with your new friend and commentate over what is being said on stage.</p>

<h1>What Does it Look Like in a 1:1 Call</h1>
<p>1:1 calls look a lot like our lounges and breakout rooms with one special feature; the stage is still visible! This design creates a unique dynamic where you two are not only just speaking to each other but can also still participate in what's going on on the stage and commentate on it. You will still be able to engage in public chat, and you will have access to the Photo Booth feature where you and your friend can take a picture together.</p>
