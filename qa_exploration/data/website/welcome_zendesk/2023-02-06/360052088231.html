<ul>
<li>Refreshing the page solves many common issues.</li>
<li>VPNs, firewalls, ad-blocking extensions, and other IT security - Depending on your setup you may have issues seeing/hearing the event. If you are just joining as an attendee (not a speaker or producer) you can view the event on a <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055728552-Mobile-Safari-Experience" target="_self">mobile device</a> to avoid these issues.</li>
<li>Please have a stable internet connection with at least 50 mbps download speed and 25mbps upload speed.</li>
<li>Mobile/tablet and Safari are supported but have limited functionality (no Breakout Rooms or Lounges for instance). Chrome on a desktop/laptop is strongly recommended for the best experience in your event. </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="01G14B57EXMSQA9YPCJEMCPR9V"><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Jumping into an Event</span></h1>
<h2 id="01G14B57EXYH000KGEE7FJE02R">Event Registration</h2>
<p>Jumping in is a similar experience across all users. If the event is using OAuth methods such as Gmail, LinkedIn, or Outlook clicking any of them will accelerate the registration process. If you do not have one of these methods available you can register using your email instead.</p>
<h3 id="01G14B57EXZ4A8DDJ78RBBHVHD">Registering with SSO</h3>

<h3 id="01G14B57EXHKTM6K8GRYF7F7JM">Registering with Email</h3>
<p>With email registration, you have two options available to you. You can either log in with your password or you can use a passwordless login that sends you a one-use click link to bypass the password requirement.</p>

<h1 id="01G14B57EXK5EANC1ZKGMWSQWJ"><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Attendee Experience</span></h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Nothing is more important than the attendees' experience of an event. The Welcome platform was designed with the attendee in mind. We created a platform that allows for an immersive experience by creating tools that will allow the event producers and speakers to engage with the audience beyond just being a talking heads. Attendees can join through desktop on Chrome (our recommendation), Firefox, Edge, Safari, or via mobile (mobile users will not be able to join anything that requires a camera and mic; Breakouts, Lounges, and the GR/stage).</span></p>

<h1 id="01G14B57EXYC0XKBGY2YYJ7BSJ"><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Speaker Experience</span></h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Speakers are the stars of the show and topics are what drive attendees to the event. A seamless speaker experience greatly influences the event's flow and overall experience. We've created a Green Room experience that will allow speakers to be prepared, communicate, and execute a jaw-dropping event.</span></p>
<p><strong>More details can be found in the Speaker <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052154731-Speaker-Guide" target="_self" rel="undefined">here.</a></span></strong></p>
<h1 id="01G14B57EXETGBX4BTFZY5FJ1F"><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Producer Experience</span></h1>
<p>Producers are essential to ensuring events run smoothly and look jaw-dropping. In the Control Room, producers have the ability to Open/Close Doors, add speakers to the stage, play pre-recorded videos/music, add custom overlays, open polls, and more! We strongly recommend that producers join the event using Chrome.</p>
<p><strong>More details can be found in the Producer guide <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051766292-Producer-Guide" target="_self" rel="undefined">here.</a></span></strong></p>
