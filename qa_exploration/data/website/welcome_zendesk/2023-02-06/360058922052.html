<h1>Welcome Studio Guide</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">The Welcome Studio is the control center for your live event. Here you will spend most of your time managing asset and agenda to prepare for your event. Managing your speakers into and out of the green room. Managing extra features and most importantly push your great content to the stage for your audience to see.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"> </p>
<h1 id="h_01EWH6VKZHQP57R1J1GXG91HWG" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Welcome Studio Basics</h1>
<p>You have four core areas that have different functions you will be operating out of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#h_01F4HJXEZ39Z14CJ1FGJR1FH79" target="_self">Green Room</a> on the bottom</li>
<li>
<a href="#h_01F4HJXVSC3KVKTR5CYC9P944Y" target="_self">The Stage</a> in the middle</li>
<li>
<a href="#h_01F4HJY5RHQK2SJ64YQ6SFS0XZ">Stage Management Panel</a> on the left</li>
<li>
<a href="#h_01F4HJYBX293HMXBEKJRVGE8CQ" target="_self">Interaction Panel</a> on the right</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/11661796742676" alt="entering the studio.gif" width="531" height="299"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You can enter the Studio in two ways, from the Event Dashboard or directly from the event link.</p>
<h2 id="h_01F4HJXEZ39Z14CJ1FGJR1FH79">Green Room</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/11661173578004" alt="Studio guide Green room.png" width="524" height="295"></p>
<p>Think of the Green Room as the staging area for your speakers before they hit the Stage and present to the entire event. Anyone who needs to be on the Stage will need to enter the Green Room first.</p>
<h4 id="01FTERV49BA8PFTFSSS2YTPB4R">Functions available</h4>
<ul>
<li>Green Room Volume - This room has a volume slider independent of the Stage; this will allow you to hear what you need to hear and turn down what you don't. 
<ul>
<li>When Speakers go from the Green Room to the Stage this volume will default to mute; this occurs so that speakers on the Stage are not distracted by the Green Room chatter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A/V Cogwheel - allows you to change your camera and microphone devices.</li>
<li>Screen share/Present Button - This will enable you to share your desktop, application, or Chrome tab.
<ul>
<li>If you also want to share audio you can check the "Share Audio" at the bottom left of the pop-up when sharing a Chrome tab or sharing on a Windows computer.</li>
<li>If sharing via a Mac device for the first time, you may need to alter your devices system preferences to allow Chrome access. Our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058944832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Troubleshooting Permission Issues</a> article explains how to do that in detail (at the bottom of the article).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Join/Leave Green Room Button - How to enter/exit the Green Room.
<ul>
<li>Only Producers/Staff can enter and exit on a whim. Speakers and attendees will need to be invited to join the Green Room.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>User Video Previews - When you hover your mouse over the different users in the Green Room, you will be presented with some options:
<ul>
<li>Camera - This will allow you to turn the camera on and off for that user.</li>
<li>Microphone - This will enable you to turn the microphone on and off for that user.</li>
<li>X Button - Kicks the user out of the Green Room.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Green Room itself has a 12 "person" limit and the Stage has an 8 "person" limit
<ul>
<li>Screen shares count as one person.</li>
<li>A video playing on the Stage also counts as one person.</li>
<li>Because of these limits, we recommend you only have people in the Green Room that need to be there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note that as a producer, you do not need to be in the Green Room to hear what's going on in the Green Room.</li>
</ul>
