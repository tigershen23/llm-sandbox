<h1>Help, my Attendees/Speakers can only see a black screen and no audio!</h1>
<p>One of the most common issues you will hear from users is "Has it started yet? I only see a black screen and no audio". This is most likely due to either a VPN, some sort of network security like a firewall, and/or a security extension installed in their browser. </p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Of the three ways this could happen, a VPN is the most common. The simplest solution to this is to ask if they are able to disable the VPN. This may not be possible in all cases, so let us break down the different ways this can happen with possible solutions.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"> </p>
<h2 id="01G3VV399CWYMZP5VW9CYVPANE" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">VPN </h2>
<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Turn off VPN if possible.</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Try a different browser or an incognito/private window.</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Use a different device; generally, we recommend a personal device as these are less likely to have security installed on the device.</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">
<a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055728552-Mobile-Safari-Experience" target="_self">View the event on mobile</a>. Attendees will still be able to utilize the chat, Q&amp;A, and polls on mobile. However, they will not be able to join lounges or breakout.</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If you are recording the event, offer a way to view the event recording.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="01G3VV399CV4KQT0S68818ET4W">Firewall</h2>
<ul>
<li>Move to a personal network such as using a mobile phone as a wifi hotspot. Sometimes a Guest network will work.</li>
<li>Offer your IT team our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405168567956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Networking — troubleshooting &amp; tuning for optimal performance</a> guide.</li>
<li>View the event on mobile using a mobile data plan. Mobile allows for all of Welcome's functionality except for joining breakouts or lounges.</li>
<li>If you are recording the event, offer a way to view the event recording.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="01G3VV399CY9SCVKPMTBYG59PH">Browser Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use an incognito/private window of the browser. This will generally disable installed extensions that could be blocking the feed.</li>
<li>Manually disable the security extension that was either installed by IT security or even pop-up blockers.</li>
</ul>
