<h1>4/8/22</h1>
<p>Welcome back for another round of updates, fixes, and features!</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>Safari support is slowly being rolled out. Previously on desktop Safari, you had a limited experience where you can just watch the stream and users might be blocked from entering the app if the stream is not spun up yet. This feature makes the desktop Safari experience like the normal desktop experience on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. The mobile experience using Safari is unchanged.
<ul>
<li>Some things to note:
<ul>
<li>The Jump In Screen now is "Click Anywhere to Jump In".</li>
<li>There is a dismissible banner directing users to use Chrome for the best experience</li>
<li>You can do everything on Safari (speak, produce, go to lounges/breakouts, etc.) except for screen share. We recommend that you still advise speakers and producers to use Chrome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quick registration allows for an easier joining experience for new attendees. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> if you'd like this enabled for your organization.</li>
<li>
<span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Anonymous Q&amp;A g</span>ives producers the ability to allow attendees to hide their names or to hide all names by default in Q&amp;A. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> if you'd like this enabled for your organization.</li>
<li>Domain deny list allows for producers to restrict registration from emails of a certain domain. Please note that this adds new behavior to sign out people who are denied entry into the event so that they can easily log in again with different credentials.</li>
<li>
<strong>BETA:</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Speaker moderation gives the ability for speakers to moderate Q&amp;A when moderation is turned on. Speakers will also have the ability to delete chats from the public chat.</li>
