<h1>Sponsor Guide</h1>
<p>Congratulations you are a sponsor for a jaw-dropping event! Let's walk you through the platform and show you how to navigate the different areas.Â </p>
<p>First things first let's make sure you use our <a href="https://app.experiencewelcome.com/compatibility-check" target="_self">compatibility checker</a> to prevent issues joining the event;Â  this will run a quick hardware check for the device you are using. Furthermore, please review our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051617192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Before You Start</a> article that goes into further details you may want to check out before joining an event.</p>

<p>Now that you have ensured your hardware and device are good let's walk through the platform together. We will go through three critical areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#h_01FN9PXTN0YV7N1TR91XV7NCHE" target="_self">Registration</a></li>
<li><a href="#h_01FN9PY997B32WKKC77DK3E0KH" target="_self">Platform Orientation</a></li>
<li><a href="#h_01EW0JZNN8YEQEF3RSWP9YDY9E" target="_self">Lounge Rooms and Breakout Rooms</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="h_01FN9PXTN0YV7N1TR91XV7NCHE">Registration</h1>
<p>The event producers will share a link with you for the event, along with the date and time. From there you will need to register. Below are the options you have and a couple of short walkthroughs.</p>
<p>Using Single Sign-on with Gmail, LinkedIn, or Outlook</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/d1cc194d7d4c47a5b4ae25f430252d16" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Using email</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.loom.com/embed/d595a7dbdd6549279c803da8c9beae2a" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Please note that you will be locked out for a 15 minute period if you <strong>input your password incorrectly 10 times</strong>. If you are having trouble registering for an event, you can ask the event producers to send you a "one-click registration link" that bypasses the need to create an account or go through this flow. Producers, please follow this <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053086291-Help-my-Attendees-Speakers-are-saying-they-can-t-get-into-the-event-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide here</a>.Â </p>
