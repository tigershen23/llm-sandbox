<h1>Event Dashboard Guide</h1>

Here you will be able to customize the different parts of the event, manage your list of attendees, speakers, and producers, collect your data, and handle recordings after the event ends.</p>

<p>The Event Dashboard has two main sections. On the left is the Navigation Panel and on the right is the body of content. Navigation Panel is where you will be moving to and from each section. Important things to notice at the very top is a button that will open up a new tab for the <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058922052" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Control Room</a> (labeled "Control Room") and a "Preview As Attendee" button to see what your landing page looks like.</p>
<h2 id="h_01F389H5ZP2FC2TSHJT85ZWZ8P">Overview</h2>
<p>This is your landing page in the Event Dashboard. It contains the event link you will want to share with your attendees and speakers to get into the event, the date and time of your event, and it will also display your cover image (you can make changes to the cover image in the <a href="#h_01F4F0FA0JV9D1EKV15A0R8PVM" target="_self">Brand Details</a> section).</p>
<h2 id="h_01F389J09FYM5F28ANQQBK91BC">Event Details</h2>
<p>Event Details is where you will set much of your event information and feature enablement.</p>
<p>When making edits in this section be sure to click the "SAVE" button for each section to save the changes for that section. Please note that this must be done section by section.</p>

<ul>
<li>Event Name - The name of the event is limited to 60 characters.</li>
<li>Event Description - This is the main body of text on the event registration page. Be aware of 300 character limit, if you go beyond the limit it will interfere with the scaling of your registration page image.</li>
<li>Start and End Time - Sets the time of the event. When setting the start time you are unable to set it to a time in the past or have the end time finish before the start time.</li>
<li>Time Zone - This will set the default time zone for your event.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="01FRGKPAT4XAKK9RJDBKH9YNTN">Access type</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is the default setting. This means anyone with an email can register and enter the event once the doors are open.</li>
</ul>
<p>Email Allow List</p>
<ul>
<li>Think of this as "guest list only". Registrants may register only if their email domain matches an approved email domain, or imported manually into your attendee list. If the email domain is not listed in the attendee/speaker/staff list that means they cannot register.</li>
<li>Additionally, you can register folks manually in the dashboard or via a CSV upload.</li>
</ul>
<p>Domain Deny List</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to block certain email address by domain name from registering for the event.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="01FRGKPAT4DGKP553DARPG6G1Z">Sign-in Methods</h3>

<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Google (OAuth)</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Linkedin (OAuth)</li>

<li>This creates additional tabs in the event that are linked to website URLs that are then embedded into the event.</li>
<li>The website you are linking to will need "iframing" for it to work. Most large public websites will not have this option on so you won't be able to link them. You can use <a href="https://iframetester.com/">https://iframetester.com/</a> to check if your website is compatible. </li>
<li>When adding the URL please <strong>do not</strong> include HTTPS:// as it's already included. Adding this a second time will cause the page to not load.</li>

<h2 id="h_01F389JPJA573GD5KR6NX2A50C" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">People - Attendees, Speakers, and Staff</h2>
<p>This is where you manage the users of your event. If needed, you can change the name of these in "Event Details". Anyone except staff who registers will default as an Attendee. Speakers will either need to be added manually or promoted from attendee to speaker after they have registered. The interface for each of the user types are largely the same with minor differences. Let's dive into the different functions and note the differences as we go.</p>
<h3 id="01FRK3QTHA1GMC539ZHHEQFFY7">Sending Invites</h3>
<p>You have multiple ways to send invites from this section ranging from bulk groups to individual users.</p>
<p>Sending invites in bulk can simply be done by clicking the "Send Invites" button at the top right corner. This will send invites to all those with an unconfirmed status. This feature is unavailable for Staff.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4414785740948/Send_Mass_Invites.gif" alt="Send Mass Invites.gif" width="519" height="292"></p>
<p>If you have a group of specific users you would like to send to you can do so by checking the boxes next to their names then clicking "Send Invite(s)"</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4414780217620/Selected_Bulk_Invites.gif" alt="Selected Bulk Invites.gif" width="517" height="291"></p>
<p>Lastly, you can either send a One-Click Link to a user via email or copy and paste it to the user with whatever method you would like to do it. To do so you will see an Action Column to the right of every user.</p>
<p>Clicking on the 3 stacked dots at the far right will reveal a drop-down. Select One Click Link options that fit best for you. One-Click Links will allow users to jump straight into events with the least amount of registration friction.

The required fields for creating an account are first name, last name, and email address; you do not need to add in a user's role/company or image to create an account. You will not be able to add anyone for Staff; instead, Staff users can simply login to the event and they will automatically populate.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4414917549844/adding_a_single_user.gif" alt="adding a single user.gif" width="517" height="291"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Adding users in bulk can be done with a CSV upload by clicking the "Upload" button at the top right to access the pop-up. We have a specific template and instructions for the uploads that you will need to use (the only required fields are first name, last name, and email address).

<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Editing user profiles can be done by clicking the 3 stacked dots in the action column to the far right. A drop-down will appear and an "Edit" option will be available. You will only be able to edit name, role, and company fields. If you have custom fields as part of your registration they will not be editable. </li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Promoting an attendee to a speaker can be done by clicking the 3 stacked dots in the action column to the far right of the users row.

</ul>
<h2 id="01FRTTENS002BDYZKX0TDPTTP0" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Email</h2>
<p>The email section allows you to set up and schedule email reminders 24 hours and 1 hour before the event begins. These reminder emails will contain the user's unique One-Click Link for easy access to your event. You are able to set up either option individually and you will also have a preview button for either to send a test example to your own email to view what it would look like.
