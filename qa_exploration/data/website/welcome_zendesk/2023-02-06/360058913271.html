<h1 id="01GDKG9WF3BSKWMPZWJ92M97XQ">Speaker Moderation</h1>
<p>You can now allow speakers to moderate Q&amp;A. This can be enabled in the dashboard by selecting People -&gt; Speakers -&gt; switching the toggle to "Allow speakers to moderate chat and questions".</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9547010292500/Screen_Shot_2022-09-22_at_7.51.54_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-09-22 at 7.51.54 PM.png" width="428" height="145"></p>
<p>In order for speaker moderation to be activated, both the "Allow speakers to moderate chat and questions" toggle in the dashboard <strong>AND </strong>the "Moderate questions" toggle under the cogwheel in the control room must be selected.</p>
<p>Keep in mind <strong>speakers can only moderate while on the stage</strong>. During this time they will have all the same privileges as a producer including allowing/denying question and writing written responses.</p>
