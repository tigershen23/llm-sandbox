<h3><strong>Lounge &amp; Breakout Rooms</strong></h3>
<p>These rooms have been getting some fresh paint! Here are a few upgrades to keep in mind when planning your next event:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Room limit increased.</strong> Lounge and breakout rooms now support up to SIXTEEN people. Woot!</li>
<li>
<strong>Screenshare.</strong> Producers &amp; Speakers can now share their screens in these rooms. So if you need to facilitate a discussion, go ahead and present those fancy slides!</li>
<li>
<strong>Lounge room customization.</strong> Whether it's a sponsored room or a themed happy hour you can now add a logo, a brand color, a call-to-action button, and custom photobooth templates to lounge rooms.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Domain Switch</strong></h3>
<p>As part of some housecleaning we're switching our app domain name from <a href="http://app.welcomeonline.co/">app.welcomeonline.co</a> to <a href="http://app.experiencewelcome.com/">app.experiencewelcome.com</a>, this will take effect on October 29th. Any previous links will still work for the next 6 months. For any future invitations, just use the new link. Also please make sure to whitelist emails coming from the <a href="http://experiencewelcome.com/">experiencewelcome.com</a> domain so you and your attendees never miss an email.</p>
<h3><strong>Compatibility Checker</strong></h3>
<p>Running kick-ass events from a web browser is no easy feat! VPNs, browsers, and connection speeds all play a role. So to make sure your speakers, attendees, and Oprah can shine on Welcome we've built a quick compatibility checker. <strong><a href="https://app.welcomeonline.co/compatibility-check">Please give it a try</a></strong> and include it in your event communications!</p>
<h3><strong>Recording</strong></h3>
<p>We've increased performance to make recordings a bit more reliable! Just remember to click <strong>Start Recording</strong> at the start time of your event. ;)</p>
<h3><strong>Disable &amp; Enable Chat</strong></h3>
<p>You can now toggle on or off any part of chat (i.e. Q&amp;A, Help, etc) at any moment within you event.</p>
