<h1 id="01G3HD1W2AP5DBCXFNSV3PZNA7">Highlights</h1>
<ul>
<li>The streaming server will start preparing 1 hour before the event, so producers must ensure that the start/end time are set correctly. Please note that if you are changing your event's times you must leave a 15-minute gap to allow the streaming server time to kick in.</li>
<li>Streaming to your chosen services will start when you open your event doors and stop when you close them.</li>
<li>When doors open, they will no longer be able to modify stream settings.</li>
<li>The stream will be a <strong>view-only</strong> experience.
<ul>
<li>Viewers at Streaming sites will not be able to
<ul>
<li>View the Welcome chat interface, including Chat, Q&amp;A, Polls, and People</li>
<li>See or participate in Lounges or Breakouts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Youtube, Twitch, Facebook, and any other 3rd party will have their own chat and settings, which Welcome cannot see or get data from. You will need to access those platforms to make edits and collect data from them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Streams will have a short delay from the live event. This delay is typically between 10-20 seconds.</li>
</ul>
