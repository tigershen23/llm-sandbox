<h1>Multi-Track Guide</h1>
<p>A multi-track event will allow you to have multiple concurrent stages and areas under a single landing page. This guide is intended to show you how to create, manage, and navigate multi-track events. Before you start this guide, you'll want to be familiar with the Event Dashboard, please refer back to the feature guide <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059331171">here</a> if needed.</p>
<h1 id="01FSA5D828KW3PRHJ0PVSYCR0S">Areas of Change</h1>
<h4 id="01FSA5DA5W4H40CH2R940GTYA1">Registration Page</h4>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4415800168468/multi_track_reg_clip_difference.gif" alt="multi track reg clip difference.gif" width="519" height="292"></p>
<p>The registration page will transform from a single-stage view to a multi-stage view. You'll be able to scroll down to see the different stages, along with their agendas. This allows your attendees to have a better view of the entire event from a glance.</p>
<h4 id="01FSA5DE2K2F4J448JDBJWSR37">Event Dashboard</h4>
<p>In your Event Dashboard, you will have a new section added to the left-side navigational panel that will allow you to add, delete, and manage each stage you have added.</p>
<h4 id="01FSA5DTM7T922PT2F3G5ZS61Q">Control Room</h4>
<p>In your Control Room, you will have a new navigation panel at the top left corner in the shape of a hamburger or 3 stacked lines. This panel will allow you to change between the stages. Attendees will see this navigation panel on their end as well.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new event in your organizational Dashboard.</li>
<li>Once created, scroll to the bottom of your navigational panel on the left and click "Turn into multi-track event". Note that you can only do this if your event's start time is in the future.</li>
<li>Fill out the fields for the name of the 2nd stage you want to create and click "Turn on Multi-Track". You will be able to add more stages to the navigation panel after it has been created.</li>
<li>Congrats your event is now a multi-track event and now you will see new options in your navigational panel of the Event Dashboard.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="01FS81DYNMCYNYQMTBX60VGMM7">Managing your Multi-Track Event</h1>
<p>In the newly created multi-track event you will now see the two stages that have been created in the navigation panel on the left. One is the main stage which inherits details from your Event Details. Your new stage will not inherit these details and is a blank slate for you to customize. </p>
<p>Each stage is self-contained and will have its own unique details, agenda, stage media, and streaming settings. Let's dive into each of the sections and explore what you can do.</p>
<h2 id="01FS81DYNMQMGE0GK9YD10MKNH">Stage Details</h2>
<p>You have three specific sections you can modify:</p>
<h3 id="01FS81DYNMNJB20T6MGK8N64B5">Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Event Name - The name of the event is limited to 60 characters.</li>
<li>Event Description - This is the main body of text on the event registration page. Be aware of 300 character limit, if you go beyond the limit it will interfere with the scaling of your registration page image.</li>
<li>Start and End Time - Sets the time of the event. When setting the start time you are unable to set it to a time in the past or have the end time finish before the start time.</li>
<li>Time Zone - This will set the default time zone for your event.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="01FS81DYNM9AB4KH3XZMXWX3FE">Customization</h3>
<h4 id="01FS83KWKEQGQQNH7K8H09JNQA">Spaces</h4><p>Allows editing the names of the "Spaces" that your users will be participating in.</p><ul>
<li>Auditorium - Name of the main stage.</li>
<li>Breakouts - Name of the private/curated rooms that require invites by the producers. Please check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056785931" target="_self">Breakout Room Guide</a> for further details.</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="01FS83MN0TH3BZMNVWRA90ZYCT">Primary/Secondary Info Tabs</h4><ul>
<li>This creates additional tabs in the event that are linked to website URLs that are then embedded into the event.</li>
<li>The website you are linking to will need "iframing" for it to work. Most large public websites will not have this option on so you won't be able to link them. You can use <a href="https://iframetester.com/">https://iframetester.com/</a> to check if your website is compatible. </li>
<li>When adding the URL please <strong>do not</strong> include HTTPS:// as it's already included. Adding this a second time will cause the page to not load.</li>
<li>Check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415025877396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Info Tab Guide</a> for complete details.</li>

<h2 id="01FS9ZQ5HY3T2SXRRNDR1RSW7M">Adding and Removing Stages</h2>
<p>Adding a stage can be quickly done by clicking the + sign to the right of Stages in the navigational panel. This will generate a new stage below the others you have.</p>
<p>Removing a stage can be done within the "Stage Details" section of the stage at the very bottom. Simply click the red "Delete Stage" button and confirm the decision in the pop-up. Please note that you cannot delete the main stage. Also, any deleted stages are not retrievable.</p>
<h1 id="01FS81DYNNJBXQH8CF9J1CG1E7">Navigating your Multi-Track Event</h1>
<p>Now that you have generated your stages let's go over how to navigate to them in the Control Panel. To get there you can click the "Control Room" button at the top left. Click on it will generate a drop-down selection of your different stages. Select one to go to that stage's Control Room.</p>
<h2 id="01FSA025SMRGZC30P0T2RMZ36D">Multi-Track Event Navigation Panel</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4415799018900/Control_Room_Hamburger.gif" alt="Control Room Hamburger.gif" width="519" height="292"></p>
<p>Navigating the stages in the Control room behaves the same as it would for your speakers and attendees. At the top top left corner in the shape of a hamburger or three stacked lines is the button to open up the navigation panel (please see image below for an example). Within that panel you will see stages that are available. If the doors are closed for a stage it will state "Currently Closed". Attendees will not be able to go to closed stages but, speakers and producer will be able to. </p>
