<h1>Translation Service Integration </h1>
<p>On Welcome, you are now able to utilize a translation service such as Wordly to add live translations to your event. Using RTMP streaming out, your event's audio will be sent to the translation service of your choice. Then, your event will receive translations from the event audio in a language of your audience's choice. This will allow you to provide a wonderful experience to your attendees no matter what language they speak.</p>
<p>Something to note, while you should be able to use any translation service you choose, please note that the translation service itself does not come with Welcome and you will need to procure it on your end. Additionally, because this feature relies on RTMP streaming out you will only be able to use it if your event's times are correctly set for the streaming service to work (this means if you are testing outside of the event's hours the service will not function). Finally, this feature is currently in beta and if you are interested in this feature please let us know at <a href="mailto:support@experience">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> to turn it on for your organization.</p>
<h2 id="01G37DVYDB04DHYV035HFG36S7">Walkthrough</h2>
<p>With that said, let's break down the process of setting up your translation service for your event.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a session within your translation service. Please make sure that the time and duration match that of your event.</li>
<li>Head to the "Event Details" page in your "Event Dashboard". In the Event Customization section, you will see a place to input a "Translation Service URL".</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In your translation service, you will find a URL to include in this "Translation Service URL" section. For example, in Wordly you will want to include the "Attendee Shortcuts" URL. Please make sure that you <strong>do not</strong> include the https:// when pasting the link as it's already included on the Welcome side.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/6324751361172/Screen_Shot_2022-05-16_at_2.34.44_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-16 at 2.34.44 PM.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Click "Save" on this section to save the URL.</li>
<li>Next, navigate to the left panel and go to the streaming page. From here you will want to set up a custom stream by clicking "Add Stream" on the top right and selecting "Custom Stream" in the drop down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Single track event:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/6324789995156/Screen_Shot_2022-05-16_at_2.36.30_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-16 at 2.36.30 PM.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Multi-track event:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/6324803805076/Screen_Shot_2022-05-16_at_2.37.36_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-16 at 2.37.36 PM.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Back in your translation service you should be able to find a streaming URL and key (in Wordly this section is titled "Streaming Shortcuts). Take these links back to your Welcome dashboard and place them in the streaming pop-up. You should then see that your stream to the translation service is connected.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Streaming Shorcuts:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the Control Room of the event you should now see a box in the upper right corner that will feed the translations once the stream is live for the event. Please note that this can only be done within the event's timeframe.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">To enable the translations, all you or an attendee needs to do is click the "Attend" button on this panel to enable the translations. You can also share the link you pasted in the "Translation Service URL" section with your attendees so they can open the translations in a different tab/window if they prefer.</li>
