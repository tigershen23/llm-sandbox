This issue is most commonly associated to Mac users. If a Mac user has never screen shared with a web browser before.

<h2 id="01GQ5GAKX9T2RHDM16D93V8XTD">How do we fix this</h2>
<p>Let's walkthrough how to enable these permissions. This is most commonly associated with Mac devices. Windows devices very rarely have this permission blocked out of the box. </p>
<p>An important thing to note is that some updates to your browser or system can inadvertently reset permissions even if it looks like the box has already been checked. In these cases, please remove the permissions, re-add them, and then restart your browser. </p>

<p>Windows does not have a system setting for this specifically. If you are getting blocked it is most likely from some sort of security app denying the browser from screen sharing. You will either need to disable the app, allow the permission from within the app, and/or contact your IT team that manages permissions for you.</p>
