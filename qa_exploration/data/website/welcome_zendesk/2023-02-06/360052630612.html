<p><strong>1. Welcome has officially launched!</strong></p>
<p>We are beyond excited to announce that we have officially launched! Hosting jaw-dropping virtual and hybrid events with ease is now a reality. Over the last few months, we’ve been busy serving our customers, growing our team, and securing funding for the growth ahead! I’m glad to also announce that we’ve raised a $12M Series A round backed by Kleiner Perkins, Kapor Capital, Webb Investment Network and Y Combinator.</p>
