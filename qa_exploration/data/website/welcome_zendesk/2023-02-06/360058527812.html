<p><strong>More Interactivity with Integrated Polling</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itâ€™s finally here! Our integrated polling feature gives you more ways to interact with your attendees. You can create multiple polls at once, and participants can choose their answers on the new Polls Tab or even directly on the stage for an immersive virtual experience. You can view live results in real time or wait until the poll closes to reveal the results.</span></p>
