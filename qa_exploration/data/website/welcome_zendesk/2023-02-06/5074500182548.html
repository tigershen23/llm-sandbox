<h1>3/25/22</h1>
<p>Welcome back for another round of updates, fixes, and features!</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>BETA:<br>
<ul>
<li>Safari support is slowly being rolled out. Previously on desktop Safari, you had a limited experience where you can just watch the stream and users might be blocked from entering the app if the stream is not spun up yet. This feature makes the desktop Safari experience like the normal desktop experience on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. The mobile experience using Safari is unchanged.
<ul>
<li>Some things to note:
<ul>
<li>The Jump In Screen now is "Click Anywhere to Jump In".</li>
<li>There is a dismissible banner directing users to use Chrome for the best experience</li>
<li>You can do everything on Safari (speak, produce, go to lounges/breakouts, etc.) except for screen share. We recommend that you still advise speakers and producers to use Chrome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quick registration allows for an easier joining experience for new attendees. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> if you'd like this enabled for your organization.</li>
<li>
<span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Anonymous Q&amp;A g</span>ives producers the ability to allow attendees to hide their names or to hide all names by default in Q&amp;A. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a> if you'd like this enabled for your organization.</li>
<li>Domain deny list allows for producers to restrict registration from emails of a certain domain. Please note that this adds new behavior to sign out people who are denied entry into the event so that they can easily log in again with different credentials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Enhancements</h1>
<ul>
<li>Allow for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to be uploaded as backgrounds and overlays. You can use these files to give your event some extra pizazz with moving images. Please make sure that your SVG files follow our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053392351-Graphics-and-Video-Dimensions" target="_self">Dimension Guide</a> for the best experience. </li>
<li>Added in some recording monitoring improvements on our side.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Fixes</h1>
<ul>
<li><span class="discussion-level-1 discussion-id-f1c8aead-ae11-4b09-9f63-bf94e57741f3 notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Producers will now see a timestamp of when a scheduled reminder email was sent or when it will be sent. </span></li>
<li>Added a fix for producers sometimes getting an error registering for events.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where speakers who used a quick-reg link would automatically become attendees. Now when they use a quick-reg link they just land on the main event page to log in normally. Please note, there is no quick-reg “one-click” experience for speakers; we recommend speakers should use our standard one-click links for the best experience.</li>
<li>Added a fix for some cases where iPad users would not redirect to the mobile experience.</li>
<li>Added a fix for videos loaded into an event that would sometimes revert to a "processing" state.</li>
<li>Powered By Welcome logo
<ul>
<li>Made this logo the same color as the text in the footer.</li>
<li>Added the logo to partner events on the mobile experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
