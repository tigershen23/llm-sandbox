<h2>Referral Program FAQ</h2>
<h3>Who is eligible for the referral program?</h3>

<h3>What Qualifies as a true referral?</h3>
<p>The person you refer should have the ability and authority to make a decision about implementing Welcome at their organization.</p>
<h3>Can I refer more than one person at the same company?</h3>
<p>Yes, but it's best to refer the individual who would be the ultimate decision maker for implementing a virtual event software solution at their organization.</p>
<h3>What if two people from my company refer the same person?</h3>
<p>Yes, but it's best to refer the individual who would be the ultimate decision maker for implementing a virtual event software solution at their organization for either external or internal-facing events. This could include decision-makers in Marketing, Events Management, Internal Communications, HR or People Ops.</p>
<h3>What does the person I refer need to do after I refer them?</h3>
<p>Once we reach out by email and kick off the conversation, the person/company you refer must commit to an annual contract greater than $25,000 annually.</p>
<h3>If my referral is accepted, how will I receive payment?</h3>
<p>If your referral is accepted, we'll send you an electronic VISA card in the amount of $2,000 USD.</p>
