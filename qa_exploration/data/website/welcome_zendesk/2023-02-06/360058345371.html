<h1>Streaming Out - General Guide</h1>
<h1 id="01G3CK7DFS70CZPR3VAESEGY94">Highlights</h1>
<ul>
<li>The streaming server will start preparing 1 hour before the event, so producers must ensure that the start/end time are set correctly. Please note that if you are changing your event's times you must leave a 20-minute gap to allow the streaming server time to kick in.</li>
<li>Streaming to your chosen services will start when you open your event doors and stop when you close them.</li>
<li>When doors open, they will no longer be able to modify stream settings.</li>
<li>The stream will be a <strong>view-only</strong> experience.
<ul>
<li>Viewers at Streaming sites will not be able to
<ul>
<li>View the Welcome chat interface, including Chat, Q&amp;A, Polls, and People</li>
<li>See or participate in Lounges or Breakouts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Youtube, Twitch, Facebook, and any other 3rd party will have their own chat and settings, which Welcome cannot see or get data from. You will need to access those platforms to make edits and collect data from them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Streams will have a short delay from the live event. This delay is typically between 10-20 seconds.</li>
<li>Please be aware that an inactive stream will time out in Welcome after about 30minutes. To restart the stream, please close and then open the doors.</li>
</ul>

<li>The stream will begin when you click <strong>Open Doors</strong> for the event</li>
</ol>
<p>A couple of notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a producer tries to add more than 5 RTMP streams, the <strong>Add Stream</strong> button becomes disabled and won't be able to add any more.</p>
</li>
<li>A producer can choose to add multiple streams from the same stream URL. e.g they can add multiple Youtube streams.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="01G3CK7DFSGSTANGDRFP1ARGT9">Going Live</h2>
<p>When the doors open, the stream will start to initialize and begin. This can take 20 - 30 seconds. Producers are not able to modify any of the streaming settings while the doors are open. All streaming settings become read-only. Closing the doors will close the stream and the settings become editable.</p>

<p>Producers will start to see their streams come online right from the control room.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360089574312/Screen_Shot_2021-03-09_at_4.03.26_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-03-09_at_4.03.26_PM.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If there are any errors, it will show an error-tag on the stream that has issues. It will be up to the producer who set up the streams to determine what they got wrong with the Stream URL or Stream Key.
