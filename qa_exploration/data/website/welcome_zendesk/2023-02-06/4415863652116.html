<p>Welcome back for another round of updates, fixes, and features!</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>BETA: </strong>
<ul>
<li>Multi-track is now self-serve. For more information on this please check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415119019668" target="_self">help center article</a>.</li>
<li>You now have the ability to have up to 12 people in the Green Room. If you are interested in this feature, please reach out to our support team (<a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a>) to enable it for your organization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Enhancements</h1>
<ul>
<li>Recording file name changes now have a green alert confirmation instead of the yellow warning one.</li>
<li>Added a log-out button to error pages for authenticated users.<img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4415853875732/Untitled.png" alt="Untitled.png">
</li>
<li>Made the "Agenda" button more visible to attendees.<img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4415864644500/Untitled__1_.png" alt="Untitled__1_.png">
</li>
<li>Added an "Attended" column to the CSV download for registrations in the Event Dashboard. We also added an "attended" column to the Event Dashboard UI.<img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4415863283092/Untitled__2_.png" alt="Untitled__2_.png">
</li>
<li>We now show an error message if someone is not able to connect properly to the Welcome stage controls when first joining an event. Previously, we only showed this when they were connected and then disconnected.</li>
<li>Added in the ability for Green Room participants to view poll results without voting.</li>
<li>Added in some On Demand enhancements:
<ul>
<li>Before, when someone included a link in the description it would only show as plain text. We have made it so it's now clickable.</li>
<li>We now sort videos alphabetically by name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Producers now have the ability to upvote a question in the Q&amp;A panel in the three-dot menu.</li>
<li>We've given calendar invites in our pre-event emails an overhaul. They now contain an attendee's one-click link and have direct buttons to add to the calendar program of your email client instead of a link out to the Welcome event page.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Fixes</h1>
