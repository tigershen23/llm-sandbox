<h1>Producer Guide</h1>
<p>Creating jaw-dropping events starts with the producers running the event and understanding the platform.

<h1 id="01FTESPF009Y5A2SRQP1SVAHAN" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9447808840980/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png"></h1>
<h1 id="h_01EZ5E8TX621C1EQJFZX3JBBRD">Creating Your First Event</h1>
<p>Creating your event is pretty straight forward. In your Organizational Dashboard you will have 2 areas where to create your event. You should see "Create one now" in the center of the screen and a blue "Create New Event" button at the top right. A pop up will appear and ask for some very basic information. Confirm your choices and you will be launched into the Control Room to start building out your event.</p>
<h1 id="h_01FBW9G1KHP85B43XHK05VZSBK">Event Dashboard</h1>
<p>This is your "backend" administration page. You will spend most of your time here fine-tuning areas such as the time of the event, managing attendees, uploading assets, video recordings, and data. Please read our detailed <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059331171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Event Dashboard Guide</a> for more information.</p>

<h1 id="h_01FBW9G6V8CB0E8HB8GR8GG6D2">Event Control Room</h1>
<p>This is where you will be controlling the live show and doing a large portion of your pre-event preparation and testing. Please read our detailed <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058922052" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Control Room Guide</a> for more information.</p>

<h1 id="h_01FBW9GDT12RATVBXM3TMWWMPN" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Welcome Features</h1>
<p>We have many features that bring value and elevate the experience from just a stage on the screen to something jaw-dropping. </p>
<h2 id="h_01FBW9H080N3H8E4VBQ1B5E48S" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Breakout Rooms and Lounges</h2>
<p>We have two secondary spaces to drive engagement with the attendees in a much smaller intimate space. Breakouts are our small private groups that are curated by the producer. Attendees will have to be invited by the producer to join these groups. Lounges are more of a public small group that any attendee can jump in and out of at anytime the room is open. We have detailed guides for each <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056785931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breakout Room Guide</a> and <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058706352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lounge Guide</a>. Please read both for specifics.</p>
<p><strong>Breakout rooms vs Lounges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both can have between 2-16 people but, Lounges have spaces we call Watchers that allow attendees to jump into the room and not be on camera. Watchers are still able to chat with the other participants in the Lounge.</li>
<li>Users will need their camera and mic on and working to be able to use them (not applicable to Watchers in Lounges).</li>
<li>Both options have the capability to enable photo booths.</li>
<li>From the attendee's perspective, when inside the rooms they look identical. As a producer, the administration panels for each are different.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01FBW9H875VQZ9WPAA4ETCAR1Z" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Q&amp;A</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Our Q&amp;A feature is one of our attendee engagement tools that allow attendees to ask questions directly to the speakers publicly. These questions can be up-voted or down-voted by other attendees to give the producer a sense of what is the most popular. Check out our detailed <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058913271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Q&amp;A Guide</a> for specifics.</p>
<h2 id="h_01FBW9HH2YJ05PW8NZMZZJSGYG" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Polls</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">This allows the producer and speakers to create instant engagement with the attendees. Polls can be voted on via the Poll tab in the event interaction panel or the producer can push the poll to the stage and attendees can vote by clicking the poll answer on the stage. Check out our detailed <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058096011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polls Guide</a> for specifics.</p>
<h2 id="h_01FBW9HPBZWY6P1S1FKRCP2VRY" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Video on Demand</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Our Video on Demand feature allows you to share recordings of your event once it has ended. You can set it to allow anyone to view the event recording or you can have it set to private by requiring registration. Check out our detailed <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402364150164" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video On Demand Guide</a> for specifics.</p>
<h2 id="h_01FBW9HYR95V2SG4HSSV5N3SNK" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Streaming Out</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">We allow RTMP out to up to 5 different destinations. We currently support Youtube, Twitch, Facebook, LinkedIn, and allow you to enter custom RTMP out details. Check out our detailed <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058345371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streaming Out - General Guide</a> for specifics.</p>
<h2 id="h_01FBW9J4MMSNAKS51JGF3PHZ0C" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Raise Hands</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Raise Hands is a feature that will allow attendees and speakers to notify the producer that they have a question they want to share live on stage. This allows producers to find individuals and bring them into the Green Room and then onto the stage. Check out our detailed <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059361872" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raise Hands Guide</a> for specifics.</p>
<h2 id="h_01FBW9J9WQD3MS60HWPKR5Q02B" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Closed Captions</h2>
<p>Accessibility for your event is essential, and for many organizations, closed captioning may be a requirement. Welcome does have a closed captioning feature that meets the international WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards. If you are interested in this feature for your organization, please contact your Customer Success Manager for specifics. Check out our detailed <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402364136724" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Closed Captions Guide</a> for specifics.</p>
<h2 id="01FTESPF004DBNJXQ3A9KKFRSR">1:1 Calls</h2>
<p>1:1 Calls are supported in Welcome; you can attend jaw-dropping events and still chat with a new friend on the same platform. We want to make sure you are still connected to the event so you will have a picture-in-picture of the stage. This way you can still have a close personal interaction with your new friend and commentate on what is being said on stage. Check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403375948948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1:1 Call Guide</a> for specifics.</p>
<h1 id="h_01FC42SYVRHNV3Y25244B9YMGP">Onboarding Speakers</h1>
<p>Properly onboarding your speakers prior to the event is critical for a smooth event. Our guide below will answer various questions from the speakers, troubleshoot technical issues, set expectations for both parties, and increase your familiarity with the platform. If you are to have issues, having them appear and resolved during the onboarding sessions is ideal compared to two minutes before the speakers need to be on stage. We have a detailed <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052720251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaker Onboarding Guide</a> for specifics.</p>
<h1 id="h_01FM02M5RQG5A1EBMRV6WDZ0RN">Event Preparation</h1>
<p>Preparing for your event is extremely critical to having a smooth event. Setting up the timeline of tasks to complete prior to game day is crucial. A list of a few things to put together during this time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production Milestones</li>
<li>Communication Plans</li>
<li>Run of Show</li>
<li>Speaker List</li>
<li>Attendee List</li>
<li>Content Creation</li>
<li>Onboarding for all those involved</li>
<li>Technical runs</li>
<li>Dry runs</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="h_01FM02MDZN2FVRFPVNS00JNX68">Day of the Event</h1>
<p>Time for the big show! Make sure you get some good sleep and prepare some coffee, water, and snacks nearby. If you have planned and prepared accordingly the stress of this day will be slightly lower. Technical blips, user errors, speakers arriving late, and unforeseeable issues can always show up. It is best to stay cool, calm, and collected to work on the issues. For technical issues that you are unable to solve click on your profile image at the top right of the screen and click contact support to send an SOS. You are also welcome to email <a href="mailto:support@experiencewelcome.com">support@experiencewelcome.com</a>. </p>
<h1 id="h_01FM02MK1G4QE9XJN5ED3EG5TD">Post Event Debrief</h1>
<p>The event is over and now you can take a breath and step away for a quick five. Now that you are back at your computer it's time to review the wins, losses, post-event strategies, and review the data. Our data will not fully propagate for about 90 mins post-event time. Check out our <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408099160084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytics Guide</a> for greater specifics. After you have digested and reviewed everything, let's take those lessons and apply that knowledge to future events!</p>
