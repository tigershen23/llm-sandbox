<h1>Integrations - Welcome into Salesforce </h1>
<h1 id="01G39YWBP2D94WQSBKYHVFMQ5X"><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
<p>This article details instructions on how to implement an integration between Salesforce and Welcome. Specifically, this guide will go over how to configure your Salesforce instance to receive data from Welcome. If you are looking for information on sending data from Salesforce to Welcome, please <a href="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406395110164" target="_self">click here</a>.</p>
<p>The Welcome platform will create a new Campaign in Salesforce that is associated with the Event if one does not already exist. The integration will also create new Campaign Members within the Campaign.</p>
<p>Welcome will also send unique, one-click URLs for each Campaign Member in Salesforce. This can be included in email campaigns sent to registrants to click and jump into an event seamlessly. If Pardot is being leveraged with Salesforce, this guide will also go over how to send the one-click URLs back into Pardot to embed in post-registration email communication.</p>
<p>Lastly, the integration will check for updated attendee information every few hours and update all Campaign Members with their most up-to-date registration status at that time.</p>
