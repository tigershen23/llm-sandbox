<h1>Troubleshooting Permission Issues</h1>
<p>Permissions are probably the most common issue users have with Welcome. Permissions are both browser-based (camera and mic) and system-based (primarily for Macs), so depending on what and how you will be using Welcome you may need to confirm both are set correctly. Microphone and camera browser permissions will come up when trying to join the Green Room or Lounges and Breakouts. The other permission issue deals with screen sharing on a Mac (details found <a href="#h_01F29WJYW8BQCHD1YHMYXMD0QK" target="_self">below</a>).</p>

<p>This is a common view when joining a room that requires a camera and microphone but your permissions are blocking access to the devices.</p>

<p>This is an easy fix and we have 3 different ways of resolving this. This article is going to break it down step by step. This guide will be using <strong>Chrome</strong> as the browser since it is our recommended browser to use with Welcome.</p>
<h2 id="h_01F29WJE2FD8WWB56W7GQXNMJF">Approving Permission by Popup</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://experiencewelcome.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360091362192/Chrome_PC_pop_up.gif" alt="Chrome_PC_pop_up.gif" width="508" height="286"></p>
<p>By default, Chrome has Camera and Microphone permissions set to Ask. What this will do is cause a pop-up to appear at the top left of the screen just under the URL bar. Please do not ignore and close the pop-up, it is asking to approve permissions. Simply click Allow and then in Welcome the Camera and Microphone settings become available. In some cases, you may need to refresh the browser.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If the pop-up does not appear or if you closed the pop-up by accident. Have no fear we can still make changes to approve permissions by clicking the lock icon in the URL bar.</p>

<h1 id="h_01F29WJYW8BQCHD1YHMYXMD0QK">System Setting Permissions</h1>
<p>If you are going to be utilizing your camera/microphone and/or screen sharing on a Mac for the first time you might need to update these settings in your System Preferences. Without having these settings properly set, you will receive a permission error stating "Permission denied by system." Below is a quick walkthrough on how you can enable these permissions. Windows devices tend to have fewer of these situations but we also provide some steps for Windows devices. </p>
<p>An important thing to note is that some updates to your browser can cause your computer not to recognize permissions you have already set. In cases like these, please remove the permissions, re-add them, and then restart your browser.</p>
